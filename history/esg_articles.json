        "text": "Rabbit, a startup making new AI-enabled personal hardware, recently launched its new device, R1. The orange-colored, plasticky toy-like device was designed by Teenage Engineering, a Stockholm-based design and product company. The company (TE) started out making minimalistic (and yet iconic) musical devices that packed a powerful punch behind a seemingly toy-like exterior. R1 is a perfect example of the Teenage Engineering aesthetic.\n\nR1 is the second of the more hyped AI devices to launch in recent days -- the other being Humane's AI Pin. The reviews have been less unkind to the device, compared to the AI Pin. A lot has to do with the fact that Rabbit costs $200 and that the founder admitted to it being an early work-in-progress type product. Aside from that \"PR\" masterstroke, R1 too, is an imperfect device -- not quite ready for prime time.\n\nMy recent experience with R1 highlighted some of these challenges firsthand. The setup and onboarding process was marred by technical glitches. The additional costs for features like Midjourney raised questions about the overall value proposition. If you start to ask some serious questions, it stumbles. Even simple things can be a strain on it. I kept asking for the score of the Yankees' latest baseball game, and it kept giving me scores from a day earlier.\n\nNevertheless, R1 is still able to do quite a few things, such as transcribing hand-drawn spreadsheets into digital versions. Or act as a voice remote for Spotify across devices, though not quite well. It can summarize voice notes and show key points. It does all these things and more -- it just doesn't do any of them well. It doesn't excel at anything.\n\nAnd it is okay. Just as it was okay for Humane's product to feel inadequate and incomplete. (I am using AI Pin only as a lapel camera and hopefully will become a good lapel-camera-photographer.) Sure, these devices feel like a letdown, but if you are an optimist, then you know these devices point to an exciting new future. We are only just getting going on this journey towards a real personal (AI) computer.\n\nBack in 1995, I met with the team from Ricochet, a wireless service being planned by a company called Metricom. It was a very long time ago. As a young reporter and a broadband believer, I bought into their vision of a seamless data network that would allow me to hook up my computer and other devices to this network. The network would be built using radios hooked up on electricity poles, amongst other locations. Its initial speed was 128 kbps. In 2001, the company went belly up. They had 51,000 subscribers and owed almost a billion dollars in debt. (PS: Check out this review of Ricochet by old friend Joel Spolsky, the guy behind many well-known products such as Trello and Stack Overflow.)\n\nToday, we don't even bat an eyelid when our network connects at a mere 50 Mbps (450 times the initial Ricochet speed) when hiking in the Sierras. The future they promised has arrived, and there are few places on the planet where you can't send a selfie or rage against someone on Twitter. Even our airplanes are connected.\n\nRicochet's story is one we should all remember. We should remember it as followers of technology, as investors, as founders, and even as members of the media. This is the story of pain and the promise of being involved with technology. Ricochet, (like many others), is a reminder of the harsh reality of technology. Just because you imagine a future and want it to manifest itself, doesn't mean it will happen on a predetermined timeline.\n\nReality is real. And this story is also a good reminder that just because something doesn't work today as promised, it won't work as imagined in the future. This fusion of reality and optimism has created my own \"reality distortion field\" that I use when I come across the new, the novel, and the future.\n\nThis weird lens allows me to be excited about everything from vehicle-to-vehicle networks, mesh technologies, distributed infrastructure, synthetic biology, and of course, the possibilities of augmenting human capabilities with \"synthetic intelligence.\" Perhaps, that's why it is easy to imagine a future beyond the smartphone, a desktop computer, or life without a cinema or a television screen.\n\nThese days, \"AI\" is all we are obsessed with. Everyone is talking about AI hardware. Even mouse-makers are sending press releases about \"AI\" inside their gear. Nothing, the gadget-hype company, which is more hype than gadgets, announced headphones with AI. It is just a way to launch OpenAI, as long as you have their Nothing phone. Logitech has a button to launch OpenAI. Let's call this bullshit 101.\n\nArsTechnica puts it well:\n\nAI will likely continue becoming a bigger part of tech gadgets' marketing points, especially devices targeting those who are eager to own the latest and greatest but have varied understandings of what AI can do and its relevance for them.\n\nThere are times when AI can improve a gadget. But over the next months and years, I expect that more devices that aren't necessarily better with AI integration will advertise questionable features related to the tech.\n\nRegardless of these marketing shenanigans, we are stepping into a new phase -- artificial intelligence will become omnipresent in our lives. This will include devices that will change the way we interact with technology. But the journey to this future will be long, frustrating at times, and sometimes downright discouraging. Think back to the early days of smartphones -- aka dark ages before the iPhone.\n\nBefore the iPhone, there were numerous experiments and attempts to create the ultimate mobile device. From the early days of Palm Pilots and BlackBerry devices to the rise of Symbian-powered smartphones, each version brought us closer to the seamless, intuitive experience we now take for granted.\n\nThe AI industry faces a similar journey, requiring not only technological progress but also a fundamental shift in how we interact with and understand these devices. Similarly, the AI industry is currently in a phase of experimentation.\n\nBy giving whiz-bang demonstrations, the AI hardware devices create expectations, and that leads to ultimate disappointment. I learned a lot from my experiments with AI Pin and Rabbit's R1. The biggest lesson -- these (and other such devices) need to really hone in on compelling use cases that justify the investment for consumers.\n\nJust as the early smartphones and wireless broadband struggled to find their footing, AI devices are facing similar hurdles. The key to success lies in identifying and addressing the pain points of users. In the case of smartphones, it was the integration of intuitive touchscreens, app ecosystems, and seamless connectivity that ultimately propelled them to mainstream adoption.\n\nFor wireless broadband, it was the development of robust infrastructure and the introduction of data-hungry applications that drove demand. AI devices must find their unique killer applications and use cases that truly enhance our lives and become indispensable. For an AI device to truly succeed, it must become an integral part of our daily lives and routines.\n\nWhile AI Pin and R1 are coming in for criticism, let's not forget these companies are working with some of the more popular \"AI\" platforms -- OpenAI, Microsoft, and Perplexity. The challenges of these devices are a good reflection of the problems facing the AI-platforms. If they are going to get better -- then so will the hardware platforms.\n\nThere is no doubt in my mind that the AI devices are good signposts to a future that goes beyond the phones, and screens into a realm of invisible information interfaces.\n\nDon't be surprised if the work of R1 and AI Pin encourages Apple to \"AI\" enable its \"watch and headphones\" or Google to launch a new integrated \"AI\" in its operating system that does the same if not, more as say, a r1. The smartphones didn't kill the desktop or the notebook computer -- it just took away its preeminence as a platform of technology's future. The \"AI\" devices are going to do the same for the smartphone -- not today, but eventually.\n\nAs to these two devices, new firmware is on the way -- and hopefully, that will improve their capabilities. And soon enough we will see new \"AI\" features in Apple and Google's operating systems. It is a good time to be excited, for the real personal (AI) computer.\n\nSmartphones changed personal computing by making it \"everywhere.\" Personal computing, as we know it, is once again evolving, this time being reshaped by AI, which is making us rethink how we interact with information. There are many convergent trends -- faster networks, more capable chips, and the proliferation of sensors, including cameras.\n\nSmaller, lower energy, more powerful, and more capable chips mean we can now build smaller, more capable devices. The faster networks of today can deliver the power of the cloud instantly. More importantly, what is different is the emergence and progress made by what is colloquially called AI. Large Language Models (LLMs) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) progress means we no longer need old methods to acquire and interact with information.\n\nThere are many reviews of Rabbit R1. There is Marques Brownlee. Macrumors' Dan Barbera does a great job of digging into the device, with much less sarcasm and more measured. I like Dave2D's review the most -- it is no less critical, but it is not clickbaity and uses words very effectively.",

        "text": "Pro-Palestinian protester Mercedes, a student at Southwestern University, raises a fist as she walks out of the Travis County Jail Tuesday April 30, 2024, a day after getting arrested at a protest at the University of Texas, in Austin, Texas.\n\nBy CEDAR ATTANASIO, JAKE OFFENHARTZ and JONATHAN MATTISE - Associated Press\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Columbia University vowed to expel protesters who occupied a building on the New York college's grounds Tuesday as universities nationwide grapple with intensifying campus demonstrations against the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nMore than 1,000 protesters have been arrested on campuses in states including Texas, Utah, Virginia, North Carolina, New Mexico, Connecticut, Louisiana, California and New Jersey in recent days, some after violent clashes with police in riot gear.\n\nThe White House condemned the standoffs at Columbia and California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt, where protesters had occupied two buildings until officers with batons intervened overnight and arrested 25 people. Officials estimated the northern California campus' total damage to be upwards of $1 million.\n\nPresident Joe Biden believes students occupying an academic building is \"absolutely the wrong approach,\" and \"not an example of peaceful protest,\" said National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby.\n\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams claimed Tuesday that the Columbia protests have been \"co-opted by professional outside agitators.\" The mayor didn't provide specific evidence to back up that contention, which was disputed by protest organizers and participants.\n\n\"Walk away from this situation now and continue your advocacy through other means,\" Adams advised the protesters. \"This must end now.\"\n\nOther colleges have sought to negotiate agreements with the demonstrators in the hopes of having peaceful commencement ceremonies. As cease-fire negotiations appeared to gain steam, it wasn't clear whether those talks would inspire an easing of protests.\n\nNorthwestern University notched a rare win when officials said they reached a compromise with students and faculty who represent the majority of protesters on its campus near Chicago to allow peaceful demonstrations through the end of spring classes.\n\nThe nationwide campus protests began at Columbia in response to Israel's offensive in Gaza after Hamas launched a deadly attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7. Militants killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took roughly 250 hostages.

The crime would be punishable as a third-degree misdemeanor, or up to 90 days in jail.\n\nThe bill goes to the Senate, where a separate bill is pending that would make the crime a second-degree misdemeanor, or punishable by up to two years in jail.\n\nDAVE MCCORMICK CLINCHES GOP NOMINATION IN PENNSYLVANIA RACE: 'ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT RACES IN THE COUNTRY'\n\nMost states have a provision in state law that prohibits remote tracking, while others are adding it. Ohio is considering such legislation, Florida is increasing penalties for using such a device and Kentucky approved a new law last year.\n\nBluetooth-controlled devices made by various tech giants or digital apps installed on a mobile phone can secretly track the movements of another person.\n\nThe House bill's passage Tuesday comes a few weeks after a federal judge denied Apple's motion to dismiss a class-action lawsuit contending that the tech giant hasn't done enough to prevent stalkers from using its AirTag devices to track victims.\n\nApple's $29 AirTags have become popular items since their 2021 release, helping users keep tabs on the location of anything from lost keys to wallets and luggage.\n\nBut stalkers have also taken advantage of AirTags and similar tracking devices, and dozens of plaintiffs sued Apple in 2022, contending that AirTag users had stalked them. They said its safety features are inadequate and that Apple should have done more to protect victims after AirTags \"revolutionized the scope, breadth, and ease of location-based stalking.\"\n\nApple has condemned any malicious use of the product. It argued in court that it \"took proactive steps\" to deter misuse and that it shouldn't be liable for damage caused by third parties.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nLast year, Apple partnered with Google to set standards for fighting secret surveillance with tracking devices.",

        "text": "(Bloomberg) -- Listen to the Big Take podcast on iHeart, Apple Podcasts, Spotify and the Bloomberg Terminal.\n\nAt the end of last year, the Chair of the US Federal Reserve hinted at cutting interest rates - staving off an expected recession. It was a welcome surprise for many people watching the markets. Five months into 2024, he's poised to pivot again.\n\nOn today's Big Take, host David Gura talks with Fed editor Kate Davidson and Bloomberg Economics' Anna Wong about the Fed's latest moves and what to expect from this week's Federal Open Market Committee Meeting.\n\nRead more: What 60,000 Headlines Say About the Fed's Next Move\n\nFurther Listening: The Federal Reserve's Tricky Economic and Political Terrain, Explained\n\nListen to the Big Take podcast every weekday and subscribe to our daily newsletter\n\nHere is a lightly edited transcript of the conversation:\n\nDavid Gura: As Federal Reserve policymakers meet this week, in Washington, they're coming to terms with the fact that their fight against high inflation has gotten harder - and more complicated.\n\nThat's because of new economic data showing persistent inflation, sure.\n\nBut it's also because of something Fed Chair Jerome Powell did. Or rather, something he said to reporters at the end of a previous meeting - back in December:\n\nJerome Powell: The question of when will it become appropriate to begin dialing back the amount of policy restraint in place, that, that begins to come into view, and is clearly a discussion - topic of discussion out in the world, and also a discussion for us at our meeting today.\n\nKate Davidson: We thought, wow, that's pretty explicit.\n\nGura: That's Kate Davidson. She oversees Bloomberg's coverage of the Federal Reserve.\n\nDavidson: The fact that he was sort of so clear that they were at this, this turning point, it, it did surprise all of us.\n\nGura: That admission in December - that Powell and his colleagues felt comfortable enough about what they'd achieved to talk about cutting interest rates - also surprised Wall Street, and investors welcomed that change in tone from the Fed chair.\n\nNathan Hager: There is plenty of fuel for optimism in the U. S. market with the Federal Reserve signaling this week that it is in fact ready to start thinking about cutting interest rates next year.\n\nGURA: At a time when many economists expected the U.S. was headed for a recession, Jay Powell pivoted, and in a new analysis, Bloomberg Economics says the Fed chair did that at the \"perfect moment\" to stave off a recession.\n\nBut that pivot, in retrospect, also had other consequences. That's because the boost to growth -- which was good news -- also gave a bump up to inflation -- which is bad news.\n\nPowell is in a tough position, trying to pivot again under difficult circumstances.\n\nAnd if he's not successful, forget the elusive \"economic soft landing.\" Bloomberg Economics says the outcome of the Fed's fight is likely to be \"harder and bumpier than many in the markets expect.\"A two-day meeting of the 12-person Federal Open Market Committee is underway, and after it ends, on Wednesday, Jay Powell will take questions from reporters.\n\nWall Street is going to scrutinize everything the Fed chair says about what he and his colleagues are thinking about the economy, and what's next.On today's show I talk to editor Kate Davidson and Anna Wong, of Bloomberg Economics.\n\nAbout how that surprise pivot may lead to another one, the challenges the Fed chair faces, and what to listen for when he speaks.\n\nThis is the Big Take, from Bloomberg News. I'm David Gura.\n\nDavidson: In December, I think most people were quite surprised when he came out and gave a pretty clear indication that Fed policymakers were starting to think about cutting rates.\n\nGura: Kate Davidson of Bloomberg News.\n\nGura: A big pivot I've seen referred to as a dovish pivot. And for those of us who don't cover the Fed day in and day out, what is a dovish pivot?\n\nDavidson: Right. So, when we're talking about the Fed, hawks tend to favor, um, higher borrowing costs to make sure we're getting inflation down. Dovish means that, um, you might be thinking a little bit more about the labor market, um, and, and wanting to make sure that borrowing costs, interest rates are not so high that they're starting to lead to an undue rise in unemployment. So when we say that Fed officials were becoming and chair Jerome Powell is becoming more dovish, that means that we are seeing the attention turning toward the possibility of lowering those borrowing costs to make sure that the economy doesn't tip over into a recession basically.\n\nGura: How quickly did you recognize that the Fed chair was speaking in a different way about the economy and the path forward for the Fed?\n\nDavidson: As he kept going, we thought, wow, that's pretty explicit. I mean, something that Jay Powell is known for is being pretty plain spoken. Um, and he wants to make sure that people understand what he's saying. At the same time, usually they like to keep their options open.We assumed he would be a little more, um, just, um, a little more vague.\n\nAnna Wong: Fed communications is very nuanced and, uh, and, and, you know, You, you certainly can be an expert of the English language, but you could still not be able to decipher Fed speak because the Fed speak with a very specific, uh, in a very specific way.\n\nGura: Anna Wong is the chief U-S economist at Bloomberg Economics, and one of the brains behind Bloomberg Economics' Fed sentiment index.\n\nThat's a natural language processing algorithm.\n\nWong: You take all these headlines generated by Bloomberg editors and reporters that captured the key essence of Fed, uh, Fed officials, speeches, scrums or testimony or tweets, you know, the entire universe of Fed speak and distill it into the core component that market traders need to know.\n\nGura: I'd love for you to step back from, from the model itself, maybe put on your, just your, your, your economist hat and just give me a sense of how big a surprise it was that Fed chair Jerome Powell changed his tone at that meeting.\n\nWong: But, however, the size of that dovish surprise. Uh, was surprisingly large in the model. So our model allows us to. Distill like the relative magnitude of that surprise. And amazingly that dovish surprise is even larger than the dovish surprise, uh, right after the SVB collapse in March of 2023. So, uh, that tells you how big it is.\n\nWong: It's one of the biggest, uh, dovish shock in this entire rate hike cycle.\n\nGura: And that shock ... came at a really critical moment.\n\nWong: At that time, there was a split in, and how market commentators were reading the economy. There's one camp, ourselves, including in this camp, that thinks that the economy is probably in the midst of a recession starting in October. Um, and then, um, and then there's the other camp that thinks, in fact, the economy is strong all along, and the Fed did not have enough monetary incentive restraint. We did think that if Powell were to unleash a dovish pivot, that would ease financial conditions and immediately support the economy.\n\nGura: The dovish pivot effectively had a huge stimulative effect. Here's Kate Davidson again:\n\nDavidson: I think it immediately gave people, um, assurance or reassurance that, um, a recession was not, um, imminent. The Fed was, um, had kind of signaled they were willing to do what was necessary to protect the labor market at this moment where people were starting to worry, geez, rates are very high. There's also this idea that monetary policy. It takes a while to work its way through the economy.\n\nGura: Could you talk a bit about the way that this is, kind of, in hindsight, made the Fed's job trickier.\n\nDavidson: Financial conditions loosened quite a bit, and that's always the risk because Fed officials, what they think they want to do is they raise interest rates. They tighten financial conditions, um, to get them to a point where they're constraining the economy. But once they had stopped doing that, they they kind of want to keep them where they're at, right?\n\nThey don't want them to get too much tighter or too much looser, and so it's a careful, it's a very careful balance.\n\nGura: So, while that pivot may well have pushed back a recession, that new analysis, by Bloomberg Economics, concludes it raised the rate of inflation by half a percentage point.\n\nThat's after the break.\n\nGura: We've been discussing the Federal Reserve's latest moves, and what to expect from policymakers this week, with Anna Wong, of Bloomberg Economics, and Kate Davidson, of Bloomberg News.\n\nGura: Kate, What were the first signs in 2024 that maybe Fed Chair Powell had made a mistake, he'd pivoted too early?\n\nDavidson: Well, it's hard to say because as economists often say, and as economics reporters, we sort of subscribe to this, that you can't take a lot from one data point. So we did see that, you know, inflation in January was a little firmer, firmer than people expected. Saw that again in February, saw that again in March.\n\nAnd then I think it's like three, you know, three points it can be connected to make a trend. And late last year, um, yeah. Chair Powell and some of his colleagues that had said things like, look, we don't have to see a better number every single month, month to month, but we have to continue to see more of what we've seen.\n\nGura: And it looks like the Fed chair has started to pivot again, already. Two weeks ago, at an event on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund's Spring Meetings in Washington, Powell said this:\n\nPowell: The recent data have clearly not given us greater confidence, and instead indicate it's likely to take longer than expected to achieve that confidence.\n\nDavidson: If they've effectively reset the clock on rate cuts because they want to see better inflation data, you presumably they want to see a few months of data.\n\nGURA: What economists and investors will be listening for, on Wednesday, is for the Fed chair to pivot even more. It's a big opportunity for him to do that.\n\nI think people will be listening closely for how much more data, uh, how do you want to see before you're comfortable cutting rates?\n\nBut if he says something like three months, I mean, May, June and July. I mean, there's not, there's not a lot of time for them to make that decision. So the question is, is that enough to give them enough confidence?\n\nBut if they don't have that confidence by July, then you have Jackson Hole in August, where the Fed chair typically makes a big, a big speech. That'll be a moment for him to kind of potentially signal one way or another, whether they're ready and then September. That's awfully close to the presidential election.\n\nGura: Kate, how good is the insulation the Fed has from the politics? What's your sense of how much pressure this institution is under and how much more that pressure is likely to build as we get closer to November?\n\nDavidson: I do think the pressure is going to build and I think it's important to note that it's not just coming from the right.\n\nI mean, there are Democratic lawmakers who have complained that the Fed should be cutting interest rates.\n\nSo I think that that will definitely pick up from both sides as we get closer to November. But I think that, um, Chair Powell has shown that he is pretty good at navigating all of that.\n\nSomething that, let's say that he has put a lot of time and effort into is building relationships with lawmakers on Capitol Hill. And that was hugely to his benefit during the Trump administration because even while he was, um, taking a lot of incoming from the White House, Republicans on, um, Capitol Hill defended him, essentially, they had his back and I think that that was, that was a big help because ultimately the Fed, it was created by Congress and Congress oversees the institution and that's who, uh, that's who Powell has to answer to.\n\nThe Fed chair is nominated by the president and Chair Powell was nominated by President Trump, but he's confirmed by the Senate.\n\nGura: Kate Davidson and her team of reporters are covering this week's meeting, and they're also keeping an eye on how Wall Street reacts:\n\nGura: At this moment, with this Fed meeting underway, what are markets expecting now about what the Fed is going to do in the remainder of 2024?\n\nDavidson: This is actually really interesting. Markets have dialed back expectations a lot. They were almost more hawkish than the Fed itself was, uh, at least when officials met in March. So markets now see, um, between one and two cuts in 2024, and they don't expect the first cut to come until much later in, in the year.\n\nAnd that is, I think, in large part because of this sort of surprising, surprisingly strong, surprisingly hot inflation data that we've gotten at the beginning of the year.\n\nGura: What are you listening for, what do you expect the Fed chair to say when he addresses reporters on Wednesday?\n\nDavidson: Well, I think the thing about this me, this meeting in May is that fed officials don't have to put down on paper where they see rates heading. I don't think that he's going to commit one way or the other. He's going to lean heavily into the idea that they just have to see what the data show, which is something it feels like it's kind of like a broken record.\n\nHe has said it over and over and over and over again. Um, this time he doesn't, he doesn't have to say anything else. I think he's going to not commit, uh, to a plan one way or the other.\n\nGura: Anna, you mentioned that your model is predictive. What is it telling you now?\n\nWong: The model is saying that if, the if Powell does not do a hawkish pivot to reverse his December pivot, then unemployment rate would be declining. And inflation will be 0. 5 percentage point higher. However, if he does decide to, um, do, uh, add hawkish surprises that in the next two months, then unemployment rate would be back on track to rise toward 4.5 percent at the end of the year.\n\nGura: Is it accurate to say that the change in tone in December made the Fed's job more difficult, made this fight against high inflation more difficult?\n\nWong: Yes.\n\nAs a policy makers, you really don't want to turn the economy into like a yo-yo ball where like, it's never good when the asset market is like running up by a crazy amount, and then you have to do something to burst this bubble because bursting the bubble create volatilities, create uncertainty, and it's, it's a path where things are moving gradually is always preferable to things going up and down and up and down, right? So I think from the Fed's perspective, this is, this is not a good sign. And, uh, inflation also has an inertia of its own. And so if, if the longer that inflation is away from the Fed's 2%, the more entrenched inflation will be in people's mind.\n\nAnd later on, it will be harder for the Fed to bring inflation back down to 2%. So there is actually a clock ticking, um, in, in terms of bringing inflation back to 2%.\n\nUnlock a world of Benefits!

        "text": "(Bloomberg) -- Listen to the Big Take podcast on iHeart, Apple Podcasts, Spotify and the Bloomberg Terminal.\n\nAt the end of last year, the Chair of the US Federal Reserve hinted at cutting interest rates - staving off an expected recession. It was a welcome surprise for many people watching the markets. Five months into 2024, he's poised to pivot again.\n\nOn today's Big Take, host David Gura talks with Fed editor Kate Davidson and Bloomberg Economics' Anna Wong about the Fed's latest moves and what to expect from this week's Federal Open Market Committee Meeting.\n\nRead more: What 60,000 Headlines Say About the Fed's Next Move\n\nFurther Listening: The Federal Reserve's Tricky Economic and Political Terrain, Explained\n\nListen to the Big Take podcast every weekday and subscribe to our daily newsletter\n\nHere is a lightly edited transcript of the conversation:\n\nDavid Gura: As Federal Reserve policymakers meet this week, in Washington, they're coming to terms with the fact that their fight against high inflation has gotten harder - and more complicated.\n\nThat's because of new economic data showing persistent inflation, sure.\n\nBut it's also because of something Fed Chair Jerome Powell did. Or rather, something he said to reporters at the end of a previous meeting - back in December:\n\nJerome Powell: The question of when will it become appropriate to begin dialing back the amount of policy restraint in place, that, that begins to come into view, and is clearly a discussion - topic of discussion out in the world, and also a discussion for us at our meeting today.\n\nKate Davidson: We thought, wow, that's pretty explicit.\n\nGura: That's Kate Davidson. She oversees Bloomberg's coverage of the Federal Reserve.\n\nDavidson: The fact that he was sort of so clear that they were at this, this turning point, it, it did surprise all of us.\n\nGura: That admission in December - that Powell and his colleagues felt comfortable enough about what they'd achieved to talk about cutting interest rates - also surprised Wall Street, and investors welcomed that change in tone from the Fed chair.\n\nNathan Hager: There is plenty of fuel for optimism in the U. S. market with the Federal Reserve signaling this week that it is in fact ready to start thinking about cutting interest rates next year.\n\nGURA: At a time when many economists expected the U.S. was headed for a recession, Jay Powell pivoted, and in a new analysis, Bloomberg Economics says the Fed chair did that at the \"perfect moment\" to stave off a recession.\n\nBut that pivot, in retrospect, also had other consequences. That's because the boost to growth -- which was good news -- also gave a bump up to inflation -- which is bad news.\n\nPowell is in a tough position, trying to pivot again under difficult circumstances.\n\nAnd if he's not successful, forget the elusive \"economic soft landing.\" Bloomberg Economics says the outcome of the Fed's fight is likely to be \"harder and bumpier than many in the markets expect.\"A two-day meeting of the 12-person Federal Open Market Committee is underway, and after it ends, on Wednesday, Jay Powell will take questions from reporters.\n\nWall Street is going to scrutinize everything the Fed chair says about what he and his colleagues are thinking about the economy, and what's next.On today's show I talk to editor Kate Davidson and Anna Wong, of Bloomberg Economics.\n\nAbout how that surprise pivot may lead to another one, the challenges the Fed chair faces, and what to listen for when he speaks.\n\nThis is the Big Take, from Bloomberg News. I'm David Gura.\n\nDavidson: In December, I think most people were quite surprised when he came out and gave a pretty clear indication that Fed policymakers were starting to think about cutting rates.\n\nGura: Kate Davidson of Bloomberg News.\n\nGura: A big pivot I've seen referred to as a dovish pivot. And for those of us who don't cover the Fed day in and day out, what is a dovish pivot?\n\nDavidson: Right. So, when we're talking about the Fed, hawks tend to favor, um, higher borrowing costs to make sure we're getting inflation down. Dovish means that, um, you might be thinking a little bit more about the labor market, um, and, and wanting to make sure that borrowing costs, interest rates are not so high that they're starting to lead to an undue rise in unemployment. So when we say that Fed officials were becoming and chair Jerome Powell is becoming more dovish, that means that we are seeing the attention turning toward the possibility of lowering those borrowing costs to make sure that the economy doesn't tip over into a recession basically.\n\nGura: How quickly did you recognize that the Fed chair was speaking in a different way about the economy and the path forward for the Fed?\n\nDavidson: As he kept going, we thought, wow, that's pretty explicit. I mean, something that Jay Powell is known for is being pretty plain spoken. Um, and he wants to make sure that people understand what he's saying. At the same time, usually they like to keep their options open.We assumed he would be a little more, um, just, um, a little more vague.\n\nAnna Wong: Fed communications is very nuanced and, uh, and, and, you know, You, you certainly can be an expert of the English language, but you could still not be able to decipher Fed speak because the Fed speak with a very specific, uh, in a very specific way.\n\nGura: Anna Wong is the chief U-S economist at Bloomberg Economics, and one of the brains behind Bloomberg Economics' Fed sentiment index.\n\nThat's a natural language processing algorithm.\n\nWong: You take all these headlines generated by Bloomberg editors and reporters that captured the key essence of Fed, uh, Fed officials, speeches, scrums or testimony or tweets, you know, the entire universe of Fed speak and distill it into the core component that market traders need to know.\n\nGura: I'd love for you to step back from, from the model itself, maybe put on your, just your, your, your economist hat and just give me a sense of how big a surprise it was that Fed chair Jerome Powell changed his tone at that meeting.\n\nWong: But, however, the size of that dovish surprise. Uh, was surprisingly large in the model. So our model allows us to. Distill like the relative magnitude of that surprise. And amazingly that dovish surprise is even larger than the dovish surprise, uh, right after the SVB collapse in March of 2023. So, uh, that tells you how big it is.\n\nWong: It's one of the biggest, uh, dovish shock in this entire rate hike cycle.\n\nGura: And that shock ... came at a really critical moment.\n\nWong: At that time, there was a split in, and how market commentators were reading the economy. There's one camp, ourselves, including in this camp, that thinks that the economy is probably in the midst of a recession starting in October. Um, and then, um, and then there's the other camp that thinks, in fact, the economy is strong all along, and the Fed did not have enough monetary incentive restraint. We did think that if Powell were to unleash a dovish pivot, that would ease financial conditions and immediately support the economy.\n\nGura: The dovish pivot effectively had a huge stimulative effect. Here's Kate Davidson again:\n\nDavidson: I think it immediately gave people, um, assurance or reassurance that, um, a recession was not, um, imminent. The Fed was, um, had kind of signaled they were willing to do what was necessary to protect the labor market at this moment where people were starting to worry, geez, rates are very high. There's also this idea that monetary policy. It takes a while to work its way through the economy.\n\nGura: Could you talk a bit about the way that this is, kind of, in hindsight, made the Fed's job trickier.\n\nDavidson: Financial conditions loosened quite a bit, and that's always the risk because Fed officials, what they think they want to do is they raise interest rates. They tighten financial conditions, um, to get them to a point where they're constraining the economy. But once they had stopped doing that, they they kind of want to keep them where they're at, right?\n\nThey don't want them to get too much tighter or too much looser, and so it's a careful, it's a very careful balance.\n\nGura: So, while that pivot may well have pushed back a recession, that new analysis, by Bloomberg Economics, concludes it raised the rate of inflation by half a percentage point.\n\nThat's after the break.\n\nGura: We've been discussing the Federal Reserve's latest moves, and what to expect from policymakers this week, with Anna Wong, of Bloomberg Economics, and Kate Davidson, of Bloomberg News.\n\nGura: Kate, What were the first signs in 2024 that maybe Fed Chair Powell had made a mistake, he'd pivoted too early?\n\nDavidson: Well, it's hard to say because as economists often say, and as economics reporters, we sort of subscribe to this, that you can't take a lot from one data point. So we did see that, you know, inflation in January was a little firmer, firmer than people expected. Saw that again in February, saw that again in March.\n\nAnd then I think it's like three, you know, three points it can be connected to make a trend. And late last year, um, yeah. Chair Powell and some of his colleagues that had said things like, look, we don't have to see a better number every single month, month to month, but we have to continue to see more of what we've seen.\n\nGura: And it looks like the Fed chair has started to pivot again, already. Two weeks ago, at an event on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund's Spring Meetings in Washington, Powell said this:\n\nPowell: The recent data have clearly not given us greater confidence, and instead indicate it's likely to take longer than expected to achieve that confidence.\n\nDavidson: If they've effectively reset the clock on rate cuts because they want to see better inflation data, you presumably they want to see a few months of data.\n\nGURA: What economists and investors will be listening for, on Wednesday, is for the Fed chair to pivot even more. It's a big opportunity for him to do that.\n\nI think people will be listening closely for how much more data, uh, how do you want to see before you're comfortable cutting rates?\n\nBut if he says something like three months, I mean, May, June and July. I mean, there's not, there's not a lot of time for them to make that decision. So the question is, is that enough to give them enough confidence?\n\nBut if they don't have that confidence by July, then you have Jackson Hole in August, where the Fed chair typically makes a big, a big speech. That'll be a moment for him to kind of potentially signal one way or another, whether they're ready and then September. That's awfully close to the presidential election.\n\nGura: Kate, how good is the insulation the Fed has from the politics? What's your sense of how much pressure this institution is under and how much more that pressure is likely to build as we get closer to November?\n\nDavidson: I do think the pressure is going to build and I think it's important to note that it's not just coming from the right.\n\nI mean, there are Democratic lawmakers who have complained that the Fed should be cutting interest rates.\n\nSo I think that that will definitely pick up from both sides as we get closer to November.

In fact 840,000 right here in Indonesia alone,\" he said.\n\nMicrosoft said in a statement the investment would be over four years. Dharma Simorangkir, Microsoft Indonesia's president director, said it \"sets a new milestone for Indonesia's digital landscape\".\n\nRegional tour\n\nNadella earlier told Jokowi the tech giant's pledge was the \"single biggest investment value\" in the 29-year history of its business in Indonesia, Minister of Communication and Informatics Budi Arie Setiadi said in a statement. A Microsoft statement later confirmed it was the company's biggest investment in the country. \"The investment announced today will enable Microsoft to meet the growing demand for cloud computing services in Indonesia,\" it said.\n\nResearch by global consulting firm Kearney showed AI was poised to contribute $1 trillion to Southeast Asia's GDP by 2030, with Indonesia predicted to see more than a third of that, the statement said.\n\nBudi told reporters Jakarta was lobbying Microsoft to open a research and development centre in Indonesia, including in the planned new capital Nusantara that is due to open from August.\n\n\"We offered several places: Bali, IKN [Nusantara],\" he said.\n\nMicrosoft has been hugely rewarded by investors since it aggressively pushed into rolling out generative AI, starting with its $13 billion partnership with OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, in 2023.\n\nNadella said last week sales in the January-to- March period rose by 17 per cent from a year earlier to $61.9 billion, with net profit up 20 per cent to $21.9 billion.\n\nThe embrace of AI has boosted sales of Microsoft's key cloud services such as Azure, which have become the core of its business under Nadella's leadership.\n\nNadella's visit comes just weeks after Apple CEO Tim Cook met Jokowi and President-elect Prabowo Subianto as the tech giant explores ways to diversify supply chains away from China.\n\nCook said Apple was looking at potentially investing in manufacturing in Indonesia.\n\nNadella is travelling on to Thailand and then Malaysia this week on a regional tour to promote Microsoft's AI tech.",

        "text": "Apple is testing a version of its Safari web browser that includes UI tweaks, advanced content blocking features, and a new AI-powered tool dubbed Intelligent Search, AppleInsider has learned.\n\nThe software -- expected to debut as Safari 18 later in 2024 -- is currently undergoing evaluation alongside internal builds of Apple's next-generation operating system updates, namely iOS 18 and macOS 15, according to people familiar with the matter. Should all of the new features make it to the release candidate stage, users will be treated to a new user interface (UI) for customizing popular page controls, a \"Web eraser\" feature, and AI-driven content summarization tools.\n\nEngineers evaluating the latest builds of Safari 18 can find a toggle for the new page controls menu within the browser's address bar. The menu consolidates -- and provides quick access to -- old and new page control tools, among them being the browser's new \"Intelligent Search\" feature.\n\nThis feature is not automatically enabled in test builds of Safari 18 and instead requires manual activation from the page controls menu. Once enabled, it's believed the tool leverages Apple's on-device AI technology -- specifically the Ajax language-learning model -- to identify topics and key phrases within a webpage for which to base the summarization.\n\nIn selecting key phrases, Apple's LLM software identifies sentences that provide explanations or describe the structure of objects, depending on the text in question. Words repeated within a text and key sentences are recognized as text topics.\n\nThese early indications suggest Apple is striving to deliver text summarization alongside Safari 18 later this year, though the exact implementation of this feature remains fuzzy.\n\nApple's text summarization features could be a response to rival generative AI tools, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT. But Apple's on-device models and technologies like Private Relay could make the experience much more secure for users. Intelligent Search is also likely to be the same AI browser assistant that one X user hinted at a couple of weeks back.\n\nAlso accessible from the new page controls menu is a feature Apple is testing called \"Web Eraser.\" As its name would imply, it's designed to allow users to remove, or erase, specific portions of web pages, according to people familiar with the feature.\n\nThe feature is expected to build upon existing privacy features within Safari and will allow users to erase unwanted content from any webpage of their choosing. Users will have the option to erase banner ads, images, text or even entire page sections, all with relative ease.\n\nThe erasure is said to be persistent, rather than limited to a browsing session. This means that Safari will remember the changes even after the original tab or window has been closed.\n\nWhen visiting a web page with previously erased content, Safari will inform the user that the page has been modified to reflect their desired changes. The browser will also give the user the option to revert changes and restore the webpage to its initial, unaltered state.\n\nAs for where Apple got the inspiration for Web Eraser, the company could have Sherlocked the feature from the third-party app 1Blocker. The application features a similar way of erasing ads, where users would tap ads to make them disappear.\n\nThe new page controls menu referenced throughout this article will attempt to offer Safari 18 users quick and easy access to several options previously located across different menus and the Share Sheet. Running on pre-release versions of macOS 15, for instance, the menu also pulls in the \"Aa\" menu common on existing iPadOS versions of the browser. These include zoom options, webpage settings for privacy controls, content blocking options, extension shortcuts, and access to the new AI and erasure tools.\n\nThese various options existed previously on macOS, but were found by navigating through the Safari settings menu. Having all of these controls in one central location in the Address Bar will make these options more discoverable for end users. Other options like on-page text search and reader mode are also in this menu.\n\nThis all suggests Apple intends to unite the iPadOS and macOS Safari UI paradigms when it unveils its new OS releases during its Worldwide Developers Conference in June.\n\nSimultaneously, Apple is also working on a much more powerful visual search feature scheduled for integration sometime in 2025 that will allow users to obtain information on consumer products when browsing through images. People familiar with the tool say it's similar to the Visual Lookup feature, through which Siri can identify plants, pets and landmarks from photos.\n\nVisual Search could be implemented as a system-wide feature. So, instead of surfacing search results in the Photos app, the user may be able to use Visual Search directly in Safari by selecting an image.\n\nGiven development of this tool is in the earlier stages, it remains unclear how Apple will ultimately go about implementing it. It also remains to be seen whether or not the feature will make it through internal testing.\n\nThe iPhone maker has expressed significant interest in artificial intelligence and more recently published research related to on-device language learning models. This goes hand in hand with widespread rumors about several other AI-powered software features, many of which are expected to make their debut later this year with iOS 18.\n\nFrom its inception, Safari was always meant to rival existing web browsers.\n\nSafari was originally added to macOS as a means of replacing Microsoft's Internet Explorer for Mac, which was the default browser. Over the years, the app made its way to the iPhone, and has since received various upgrades over the years.\n\nMore recent versions of Safari provide users with personalized web suggestions, and allow for greater privacy protection with features such as iCloud Private Relay.\n\nThis latest set of enhancements only serves to better position Safari against the competition, in an ever-increasing landscape of generative AI tools and third-party ad-blockers.\n\nWhile Apple tests many such features during different development stages, it is important to remember that not all of them make it to release. Apple has been known to delay features or cancel them entirely, so there's always a chance we may not see these new Safari features after all.\n\nAlong with Safari 18 and its associated improvements, we should also see a revamped Calculator with Math Notes make its way to iPadOS 18. Freeform Scenes and Adaptive Voice Shortcuts are new OS features, which are also expected to debut later this year.\n\nApple is expected to introduce various AI-related enhancements as part of iOS 18 and macOS 15, both of which should be announced at the company's annual WWDC on June 10.",

        "text": "America's government may be banning TikTok soon, but it is facing a closer app ban with its Coins' direct purchase option now offered to users via its website. Users who saw this new setup shared screenshots of the new payment option for TikTok's coins, one that violates the Apple App Store rules and regulations as it avoids in-app purchases, a.k.a. the 70-30 commission split.\n\nSimilar to Spotify, Epic Games, and more, this new App Store bypass has offered users a way to avoid the commission rate, but in some cases, it has led to its ban on Apple's devices.\n\nTikTok is not treading lightly, as another bold move on iOS platforms made it a target, now offering users a way to buy more coins through direct purchases on its websites and not via the Apple App Store. According to David Tesler, TikTok now offers a direct purchase option for its coins, an in-app currency allowing subscribers to support its creators on the platform.\n\nA new pop-up message on TikTok offers this way to purchase coins outside the App Store: \"You can save the service fee and get access to popular payment methods.\"\n\nApple charges 30 % for every in-app purchase, but TikTok revealed that users may save up to 25% when using its third-party option via PayPal, credit card, or debit card payments.\n\nThe explicit messaging of TikTok is grounds for App Store rules violations, one that may lead to a TikTok app ban on the platform.\n\nApple considers these \"tips\" to be digital goods, requiring in-app purchases, similar to Epic Games' third-party option for Fortnite before it was banned.\n\nFor many years now, Apple's commission rate has been scrutinized by developers and other Big Tech companies. The charge gives developers 30 percent of all app or in-app purchases via the App Store. While this leaves 70 percent to developers, not all are on board with Epic Games' Nineteen Eighty Fortnite attacking Apple and leading to its ban on the App Store.\n\nHowever, not all cases lead to a ban.\n\nSpotify is known as a long-time vocal critic of Apple's policies, particularly the App Store's commission rate. The music streaming platform previously removed in-app subscriptions on iPhones. Spotify Premium users on iOS were asked to re-subscribe again, but this time, outside of the App Store and directly on Spotify's website, to bypass the commission rate, but this did not lead to a ban.\n\nMoreover, it was recently followed by Netflix, which also opted for a third-party subscription method instead of the in-app purchases on iOS devices but did not face a ban. Not all cases lead to a ban, but it is certainly the worst-case scenario, something that is looming over TikTok with its recent move, particularly as it is on thin ice with the US government.",

        "text": "Since the global economic meltdown triggered by the financial crisis, which lasted from 2007 to 2008, the world may not have fully returned to the era of abundance. The crisis, which is only comparable to the Great Depression of the 1930s, revealed that the world is connected beyond the economic hardship the situation brought on mankind.\n\nThe 1929-1932 crisis was reported to have caused a 15 percent fall in gross domestic product (GDP). If this is compared to the less than 1 percent drop in worldwide GDP during the 2007 global economic meltdown, one can infer that the world has probably suffered fifteen times the economic calamity of recent years.\n\nEven with milder effects and a much faster recovery rate, the distrust that followed the experience has kept business growth at a crawling rate. Likewise, human interactions have become suspicion-filled, owing to the fact that the economic collapse on both occasions, apart from being largely similar, is largely attributable to indiscretion, excessive risk-taking, regulatory and policy errors, failure to honour loan repayment obligations, and other human surfeits.\n\nFor these reasons, businesses have decidedly become insular and mounted barriers to sequester them from incidents and accidents. This paints a picture of our business environment and reflects the pervasive attitude in the economic climate. The trust deficit is as high as the sky. So, extra caution is limiting our leap into adventure and innovation.\n\nSince the time when the world came out of the recession, business growth has been really lean, with a record-breaking regional recovery in Asia. In the last fourteen years or so, systems and frameworks that may help our economies and businesses resist breakdowns have sprung up. Logically, these should ordinarily boost our confidence and inspire greater strides in our endeavours.\n\nBut the gaps created by the misalignment of soft issues, especially trust building and confidence restoration, have not allowed complete optimisation of the technology and strategies deployed to improve economies and businesses around the world. So far, businesses are acting like humans are not at the centre of business operations and unwittingly ignoring the place of emotions, trust, and perception.\n\nIn today's fiercely competitive market landscape, where consumers are bombarded with an abundance of choices, building and maintaining trust has emerged as a pivotal factor for business success. In the digital age, where information flows freely and opinions are shared instantaneously, establishing a trustworthy brand has become more challenging yet more essential than ever before.\n\nTrust is the licence an organisation earns to grow and the foundation that allows it to take responsible risks and, if it makes mistakes, to rebound from them. For a business, especially, lasting trust is the strongest insurance against competitive disruption, the antidote to consumer indifference, and the best path to continued growth. Brand trust serves as a potent catalyst for business growth and credibility, fostering customer loyalty, driving sales, and enhancing reputation.\n\nBusiness growth and sustenance in our highly complex socio-economic environment require a new thinking and approach that is centred around building trust. Businesses or individuals that are able to drive authenticity, consistency, and transparency and create a social reality that positions them as value creators, solution providers, and partners in progress are most likely going to become a big deal.\n\nWhen consumers perceive a brand as genuine and reliable, they are more likely to develop a sense of trust. Authenticity entails staying true to the brand's values and promises, while consistency ensures that every interaction with the brand reinforces a positive perception. Transparency, on the other hand, involves being open and honest about products, services, and business practices.\n\nBuilding brand trust requires a concerted effort across all touchpoints of the customer journey. From the first point of contact to post-purchase support, every interaction shapes the perception of the brand. Consistently delivering high-quality products or services, providing exceptional customer service, and actively engaging with consumers are vital elements in nurturing trust.\n\nMoreover, in an era dominated by social media and online reviews, brands must actively listen to customer feedback and address concerns promptly. Responding to queries and resolving issues in a transparent and empathetic manner not only demonstrate accountability but also strengthen trust and loyalty.\n\nUnderstanding the importance of brand trust leads to the question of how this directly impacts business growth.\n\nFirstly, it fosters customer loyalty, encouraging repeat purchases and long-term relationships. Loyal customers not only spend more but also serve as brand advocates who spread positive word-of-mouth, which attracts new customers.\n\nSecondly, trusted brands command a price premium. Consumers are often willing to pay a higher price for products or services from brands they trust, as they perceive them to offer superior quality, reliability, and value.\n\nThirdly, brand trust mitigates the impact of negative events or crises. When a trusted brand faces challenges, such as product recalls or controversies, consumers are more likely to give the brand the benefit of the doubt and remain loyal.\n\nFurthermore, brand trust contributes to a positive reputation, which enhances brand equity and attracts top talent and business partners. A strong reputation built on trust can open doors to new opportunities and collaborations, further fueling business growth. This means there is a need for organisations, public or private, and individuals of note to invest in building trust by methodically managing their interactions with the public.\n\nSeveral companies have exemplified the power of brand trust in driving business growth. For instance, tech giant Apple has cultivated a fiercely loyal customer base through its commitment to innovation, design excellence, and the customer experience. Despite premium pricing, Apple continues to dominate market share in various product categories due to its unwavering focus on delivering products that consistently meet or exceed customer expectations.\n\nSimilarly, Denmark consistently ranks high in global surveys measuring trust in government institutions. The Scandinavian country is known for its strong welfare state, low levels of corruption, transparent governance, and high levels of citizen engagement. Danish citizens have confidence in their government's ability to deliver public services effectively, maintain social welfare programmes, and uphold democratic values. Also, countries like Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Switzerland are often cited for their high levels of trust in government. These nations prioritise transparency, accountability, and citizen participation in decision-making processes, which contribute to fostering trust in government institutions.\n\nOne powerful tool for building brand trust is public relations. Its strategic use plays a crucial role in establishing credibility, shaping perceptions, managing reputation, fostering positive relationships, facilitating transparent communication, engaging with stakeholders, aligning brand values with social responsibility, and managing communication strategies effectively. By leveraging PR strategies effectively, brands can strengthen trust, loyalty, and goodwill, ultimately driving long-term success and growth.\n\nOrganisations that understand how brand trust can be a vital differentiator in tough market conditions where consumers have countless options at their fingertips need the imprints of public relations experts for their programmes, initiatives, and corporate interactions or engagements to be meaningful, purposeful, effective, and beneficial. By employing public relations strategies, businesses can unlock the full potential of their brands and pave the way for sustainable growth in the long term.",

        "text": "Perhaps more than any digital audio workstation (DAW) I've tested recently, Studio One makes it easy to record audio, compose music, and mix. It's as if someone took Avid Pro Tools, removed many unnecessary mouse button presses, and rearranged the menus and dialogs to make sense. Studio One doesn't scale to larger studios as well as Pro Tools, but it's an inspired audio editing choice for anyone who needs a serious DAW and dislikes Avid's subscription pricing (though the latter may be changing, as I'll explain). While Studio One is an excellent app, our Editors' Choices for digital audio workstations are Cubase Pro for Windows and Apple Logic Pro on macOS, with Avid Pro Tools as our cross-platform pick for high-end DAWs.\n\nPreSonus offers four ways to get Studio One; the downloadable free Prime version has been discontinued, but PreSonus says you can still access it by installing the 30-day trial and letting it expire. Let's start with the two Perpetual licenses: Studio One Artist ($99.99) includes unlimited audio and MIDI tracks, drag-and-drop editing and comping, track folders and event-based effects, five virtual instruments, and 28 effects plug-ins. Artist also supports adding third-party VSTs and AU plug-ins, and it works with Studio One Remote for the iPad and Android. Professional ($399.99) adds built-in Melodyne pitch correction for vocals, many more effects (including a multiband compressor and convolution reverb), and more virtual instruments. This remains the flagship DAW, and it has new features that I'll cover below.\n\nYour other two options are subscription offerings. The Studio One+ plan gives you access to Studio One Professional, Notion notation software, additional sounds and plug-ins, cloud storage with collaboration workspaces, and a master class library of videos and live streams for $19.95 per month. PreSonus has moved many add-on plug-ins you could purchase to Studio One+, and they are no longer available for Perpetual licenses.\n\nNew for version 6.6, the Studio One Hybrid plan gives you the same lineup for $179.95 per year, plus a Perpetual license for Studio One Pro that's yours to keep. This just-launched plan is confusing because it seems to imply no one should spend $399.95 on Studio One Pro anymore if they get it for $179.95 with the Hybrid subscription, yet the Perpetual license remains on sale. When I asked about this, a PreSonus spokesperson responded, \"The Perpetual license awarded at the end of the annual subscription period is non-updating. A user who does not renew their Hybrid subscription will be granted the most current version of Studio One Pro, without access to future updates,\" meaning you will continue to get updates if you buy the perpetual license.\n\nStudio One requires Windows 10 20H1 or Windows 11, macOS 10.14 or higher, 40GB of free storage for the Pro version, and at least an Intel Core i3 or AMD A10 CPU. PreSonus recommends at least 8GB of RAM and a 1,366-by-768-pixel display resolution. PreSonus is also running a public beta for a new Linux version, a welcome and rarely supported platform among major DAWs.\n\nFor this review, I tested PreSonus Studio One 6.6 on a MacBook Pro 16-inch (Late 2021, M1 Pro) running macOS Sonoma 14.4.1, a second-generation Focusrite Scarlett 6i6, a pair of PreSonus Eris E8 XT studio monitors, and a Nektar GX61 MIDI keyboard controller.\n\nA significant change for version 6 is apparent immediately: The new Start Page now contains useful Smart Templates for different kinds of projects, plus more tools for organizing your existing ones. As before, Studio One automatically suggests dates and names for your new projects to help keep you organized. Studio One Professional now supports the open-source file format DAWproject, which lets you share project files with Bitwig Studio owners. The files contain editable MIDI data, plug-in settings, and more. It remains to be seen if other DAW makers adopt the format, but anything in this direction is encouraging news.\n\nGetting settled in Studio One is pretty straightforward if you're coming from another DAW, although it's probably a little intimidating for first-timers. Studio One has received a more modern look with dark and light themes, plus all the plug-ins have received new coats of paint. New projects open with a clean view, but by the time you're knee-deep in recording and mixing, expect a lot of visual clutter. The good news is that you can remove many elements, and a \"minimal\" preset lets you simplify the view considerably.\n\nOther new features: A new Lyrics Track lets you add, edit, or move lyrics, and the latest 6.6 update improves the display on Show and Project pages. The new Global Video Track makes it easier to make quick adjustments to a video production or move around podcast pieces for final assembly.\n\nPreSonus has always bundled a large, if uneven, sound set with Studio One. This is still the case, and Studio One hasn't added any new instruments in quite some time. The one exception is Lead Architect, an exclusive synthesizer instrument for Studio One+ that is not present in the current Professional version when you buy it. Omitting it from Professional, which has been in dire need of some new instruments, doesn't bode well for the future of the perpetual offerings taken together with the expanding subscription plan options mentioned above.\n\nOne of the best things about Studio One is how it was conceived from the beginning to speed up typical recording and editing tasks. True to form, getting started requires fewer clicks than in some other DAWs. Click once to record, once for the metronome, and once for rewinding; double-click to split a clip into two. It's fast, and the program is super-responsive. You can set up virtual instruments so that you just have to drag the plug-ins over, complete with a picture representation. You can easily create Split and Multi instruments by dragging and dropping additional ones on the same track.\n\nSome perennial features in other DAWs have been missing in Studio One for a while. But PreSonus is catching up, with additions such as Track Presets, which stack commonly used instruments or plug-in chains and all their settings together for call-up with a single click. Studio One now offers custom color assignments and color presets -- something I wish every DAW had -- along with auto-zoom during editing and more drag-and-drop editing features. You can customize the interface by adding or removing almost every tool from the various toolbars. You can even set the keyboard shortcuts to mirror Pro Tools or another DAW to ease migration to Studio One.\n\nMost of the regular audio editing features you'd expect in a proper DAW are also here. You can trim or split clips, add fades, and adjust the gain of a clip right from the Edit window. Studio One (in Professional guise) was the first DAW to integrate genuine Melodyne pitch correction directly within the app rather than exporting audio, correcting it, and reimporting it back in as you do in Pro Tools. Since then, other popular DAWs, such as Logic and FL Studio, have added some type of integrated pitch correction. It's not only faster, but it also means you can continue to edit the pitch-corrected clips from within Studio One without having to return to Melodyne first. In version 6.6, ARA-enabled plug-ins are now available as audio editors on the Project page.\n\nThe terrific Chord Track, available only in Professional, lets you create, listen to, and change chord progressions. With it, you can quickly move around song sections and test arrangements. Chord Track also allows for harmonic editing; you can play an instrument, drag the clip to Chord Track, see what you played written out harmonically, and then add new notes to complement it. You can also drop any MIDI file into Chord Track to extract its chords and automatically create strum patterns. Studio One also supports \"ripple editing,\" which lets you insert a section into the middle of a song; the remaining content then ripples down automatically, so you don't have to do complex cut-and-paste maneuvers. Magix Sequoia has offered this for years, and it's great to see it here. Based on PreSonus Notion, the score editor now supports tablature, lead sheets, and drum maps, making it much more useful.\n\nIn a nod to Ableton Live, MainStage, and other performance-oriented software, Studio One includes an integrated live performance environment to run and control complete shows on stage. The Show page lets you cue up backing tracks, change patches, and set up virtual and real instrument players in one window (as you can in Apple's MainStage). You can export channel strips, mixdowns, and instrument patches to the Show and arrange setlists. The program also presents real-time controls in a separate Perform view, plus more extensive metering and a virtual rack of plug-ins for effects, all of which minimize fumbling around in the dark for the right sounds before you start the next song. You can even program pauses between certain songs to talk with the audience or set it to go right into the next track.\n\nThe big news on the mixing side is Spatial Audio support, which is present from beginning to end in each project. For example, you can record in Dolby Atmos using a multichannel microphone array and mix in headphones binaurally. All relevant bundled effects plug-ins have been upgraded to support Dolby Atmos. Studio One Remote also features surround mixing and visualizations on your phone or tablet, complete with a similar 3D surround panner and multitouch support as on the desktop. Version 6.6 also adds support for Dolby Atmos composite beds.\n\nThere are some new plug-ins available as well. The new multi-tap Surround Delay can synchronize with the project tempo. DeEsser has a sharp Listen feature that can automatically find the most problematic frequency and tune itself to minimize it. The Vocoder combines two input signals and processes them with bandpass filters for glorious 1980s fun. Most importantly, two existing plug-ins received significant updates. The OpenAir2 convolution reverb sounds terrific, with plenty of lush vocal spaces you can sidechain. Pro EQ3 now offers a linear-phase low-cut, a 12th-octave spectrum display, and I/O meters with adjustable range. The latest version lets you solo individual frequency bands, and it even offers built-in dynamic equalization that would typically have you reaching for the multiband compressor or moving faders manually.\n\nDespite its cluttered appearance, the mixer is laid out well. You can insert all kinds of effects, and PreSonus provides dozens of Extended FX chains in a separate drop-down folder that helps you mix faster. You can search for plug-ins just by typing, and you can drag inserts from one channel to another and mirror them immediately as you can in Logic. The mixer now lets you control FX/Bus sends sidechains and Cue Mix from the main faders with a right-click. Three pan modes are now available -- Dual, Balance, and Binaural. The new Mixer Channel Overview page shows you all relevant settings for a given track, including its controls, inserts, sends, and cue mix, plus track icons for the first time.\n\nYou can snapshot the entire mixer for recall with Mixer Scenes, which replaces saving multiple versions of a project -- although, unlike Logic Pro, Studio One lets you mix a song a bunch of different ways and recall them all instantly. One feature I've always liked in Studio One is setting up a reverb on a send; you only have to drag the reverb to the track. Studio One automatically sets up the send, the plug-in, the return, and the level so that you've got a reverb happening instantly, and you can then activate the same send on additional tracks. You can also click the send to bring up the reverb plug-in to change the release, the type, or any other parameter without first hunting up and down the mixing board for the correct channel. This is all significantly faster than it is in Pro Tools.\n\nUsing Studio One's Mix Engine FX and its Console Shaper plug-in, you can model the sound of an analog console from within the mixing engine, including drive, noise, and crosstalk. The standard compressor also sounds good on the mix bus when set to a low ratio (1.3) for just a few dB of reduction on the peaks. In the box, you get enough effects to bring a project from start to finish, including mastering (though I'll always recommend having an experienced second pair of engineers do the final mastering if the budget allows). Finally, version 6.6 adds built-in TuneCore support for distributing your finished masters across multiple digital streaming services.\n\nAlthough Pro Tools remains the pro-studio standard, there have been some high-profile defections to Studio One. There probably should be more, given how good this program is. However, PreSonus' recent move to push the Hybrid and Studio One+ subscription plans seems to indicate that Studio One is heading in the same direction as Pro Tools when it comes to subscriptions, which will discourage some. Pro Tools still excels in importing session and individual track data, and its Smart Tool-based approach to audio editing is second to none. Unless you need Avid's support for broadcast standards and massive control surfaces or you want to have maximum compatibility with other studios and sessions, going with Studio One remains a smart alternative choice for a quality DAW. Our platform-specific Editors' Choice winners for PC and Mac DAWs are Cubase Pro and Apple Logic Pro, respectively, and Avid Pro Tools is our Editors' Choice for high-end, cross-platform DAWs.",

Apart from being another layer of security, Repair State will help verify that users with the job order legitimately own the iPhone sent to Apple and service centers.\n\nApple brings a new feature to iOS 17.5's fourth beta version called the 'Repair State,' discovered by 9to5Mac in the operating system's latest code on the public beta. Through this, iPhones sent for repairs will always be trackable, but more importantly, it will serve as the verification method for Cupertino that the devices sent to service centers are not stolen.\n\nPreviously, Apple's way of verifying a device was by asking owners to turn off Find My on their iPhones whenever taking it in for repairs. However, this was made harder through iOS 17.3's introduction of Stolen Device Protection.\n\nWhen this was made available, users had to wait an hour in service centers for the turning off/verification process, but with the Repair State, it is no longer needed.\n\nRead Also: EU Enforces Stricter Rules on Apple iPad Operating System\n\nThe iOS 17.5 beta's Repair State now lets users confirm that the device is theirs using their Apple IDs and passwords, and while it can confirm that these are legitimately owned, it is unknown how to turn it off. Beta users now have a chance to enable it, but the company says there are no procedures to turn it off by a user, and it may only be done so by technicians unknown and is in a gray area.\n\nFor many years, Apple's Find My has been known as the main security feature of iPhones and other Cupertino devices, and it will help track the device whenever it is stolen. It is protected via the Apple ID and iCloud. Still, the iPhone 15 series saw a significant upgrade thanks to its new ultrawideband (UWB) chip, calling the new feature 'Precision Finding.'\n\nHowever, Apple introduced the latest feature on the Find My tracker for regular devices, further enhancing its security measures. This feature, better known as 'Stolen Device Protection, ' was Introduced last December 2023. It further improves security by preventing thieves from using obtained passcodes to remove the Apple ID, thus not hindering the tracking feature for the lost device.\n\nWhether the reason behind Find My Tracking is to avoid losing sleep over the device's whereabouts or sending it for repair, Apple is enhancing the security measures it applies for the iPhone in its latest update. The iOS 17.5 beta now makes the Find My's Repair State available to turn on before sending it for service to help verify it to Apple.",

The phaseout has been postponed several times in the past.\n\nGoogle said in a statement that it recognizes the continuing challenges associated with reconciling disparate feedback from industry, regulators, and developers, and will continue to work closely with the entire ecosystem.

        "text": "Shou Zi Chew told US lawmakers that China-based ByteDance employees would have access to some US TikTok user data until Project Texas is implemented.\n\nSince TikTok was launched internationally in 2016, it has become one of the most popular social media platforms for musicians to promote their music.\n\nMusicians can reach an audience of over a billion users in one day all in one place.\n\nArtistes can showcase unreleased music to get ahead on their marketing strategy.\n\nThe app gives musicians the opportunity to target their audiences with affordable advertisements.\n\nThe focus is less about quality and more about authenticity -- less about perfect band press shots but all about candid short-form video content.\n\nKnowing how the back end of TikTok works will allow musicians to take full advantage of the platform.\n\nThe TikTok algorithm makes recommendations for one's unique content feed based on how much he/she interacts with the platform and the content that one likes to see. For example, if you add a 15 second snippet of your song to one of your videos, that video then appears on another users 'For You' page which gives them the opportunity to engage with your content. They can like, comment, share, and create their own video using the snippet of the song that you're promoting. The algorithm makes it easy for new people to discover your music by simply allowing the process of audio copying which is a feature that other popular social media platforms like Facebook don't have.\n\nMany Zimbabweans have now engaged the TikTok platform for entertainment but in the United States, there are proposals to ban it because of its Chinese connection. The question is: Will Zimbabwe follow the same?\n\nAmid national security concerns, there is currently a raging debate in the United States of America about the presence of TikTok among over 170 million American users. The US cybersecurity agency determined that the app poses a security threat.\n\nLegislation that could ban TikTok if its China-based owner doesn't sell its stake has won a major boost as House Republicans included it in a package of bills that would send US aid to Ukraine and Israel. The proposal to ban TikTok in the US has garnered bipartisan support, passed one house of Congress, and looms as an issue in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nTikTok has been under fire in the US for years while raising questions about data access laws. Those concerns led the US House of Representatives to pass legislation in March 2024 requiring the Chinese company ByteDance to sell off the social media app within six months or be banned from US stores and websites. The ban would force Apple and Google to remove TikTok from their app stores, and service providers could not make it available on browsers in the United States.\n\nThe bill known as the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act passed the House by a 325-65 vote with overwhelming support from Republican and Democratic lawmakers.\n\nBefore the bill becomes law, it must be confirmed by the US Senate and signed by the president. President Joe Biden said he will sign the bill, leaving TikTok's fate in the hands of the Senate, which has not scheduled a vote on it yet.\n\nFormer president Donald Trump -- who favoured a TikTok ban while in office -- now opposes a ban as he challenges Biden in the 2024 race for the White House.\n\nTikTok has pushed back, rolling out a $2.1 million advertising campaign featuring US users discussing how the app has helped them and their businesses. Reflecting the political nature of the ban, TikTok focused its advertisements on US battleground states with tough 2024 Senate races to try to convince incumbents to block the House of Representatives ban.\n\nTikTok claims more than 170 million Americans use the app, and nearly 5 million businesses have used it to start and grow their companies.\n\nThis is not the first time the United States has threatened to ban TikTok. The Trump administration attempted to block it in 2020. In February 2023, the Biden Administration banned TikTok on devices used by federal employees.\n\nIn March 2023, the FBI and US Department of Justice launched an investigation into allegations that TikTok spied on American journalists. TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew appeared before the House Energy and Commerce Committee to defend the application on March 24, 2023. His testimony touched on TikTok's consumer privacy and data security policies, the platforms mental health impact and security concerns about the platform's parent company, ByteDance.\n\nIn January 2023, TikTok proposed a $1.5 billion plan called Project Texas to move all US data to the United States to allay privacy and security concerns. That plan, which transferred data to Oracle's cloud and set up a US subsidiary to manage it, failed to sway Congress when it voted on its ban.\n\nThe United States wants to ban the application for several reasons, but mainly due to national security concerns. US lawmakers are concerned that ByteDance may leak US user data to the Chinese government if the Chinese government forced them to.\n\n\"Today, the CCP's [Chinese Communist Party's] laws require Chinese companies like ByteDance to spy on their behalf,\" Committee Chair Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., said during the hearing.\n\nShou Zi Chew told US lawmakers that China-based ByteDance employees would have access to some US TikTok user data until Project Texas is implemented. TikTok does not condone any effort by its own employees to access US user data.\n\nTikTok releases a transparency report where it discloses formal legal requests for user data. The biannual information request report shows how many requests were made in each country. According to the latest report, requests for information by law enforcement reached an all-time high in the first half of 2022, with 4,054 total requests around the globe.\n\nZimbabwean authorities are currently concerned with the posting of exclusive content on TikTok which is not suitable for under-age children. Musicians who exploit the use of TikTok to market their songs also depend on this app. This has huge implications for musicians and music industry professionals in Zimbabwe, which like other African nations is not immune to challenges in infrastructure and access.\n\nDespite these challenges, the country has produced many talented artists who have gained recognition beyond its borders. The rise of digital platforms and the internet has also provided new opportunities for Zimbabwean musicians to reach a global audience.\n\nThe digital space is important, especially for artistes without an appropriate marketing budget. You can get on a platform like TikTok for free and market your music there without having to fork out thousands of dollars. And now there's monetisation for your music from music organisations such as Zimura and other platforms like YouTube, Spotify and Instagram. You can earn without having to perform unlike previous eras where you only had to perform to earn from your music.\n\nEvery testimonial in the United States' congressional hearing touched on different topics, but some of the main focuses included the following:\n\nAddictiveness: While TikTok's addictiveness is a concern, it has a feature that tells users to leave the application after 60 minutes.\n\nMisinformation: TikTok claims it does not allow misinformation as part of its community guidelines and actively works to remove it. It also does not accept political ads.\n\nChildren's safety: There are many concerns over children abusing or misusing the application. However, TikTok has different UX for users under 13. For example, they cannot go viral and cannot use the private messaging feature and they also have other concerns including mental health.\n\nThe US already bans the application on federal and public sector employees' phones and on state employees' phones in 32 of 50 states. Several states have also recently sued TikTok. The first state to sue the company was Indiana, on claims that the application serves users inappropriate content and violates consumer protection laws in its data collection practices. Another lawsuit came from Arkansas, which sued TikTok, ByteDance and Facebook's parent company, Meta, over claims that the companies violate the Deceptive Trade Practices Act.\n\nMontana was the first US state to pass legislation banning TikTok on all personal devices. The bill was to go into effect in January 2024, but a federal judge temporarily blocked the ban in November 2023, saying it likely violated the First Amendment. The law would have prevented the app from operating within the state and fined app stores that hosted TikTok within state lines up to $10,000 per day. A final decision in the matter will be made following a trial expected sometime in 2024.\n\nSeveral universities have also banned the app on their networks.\n\nThe United States is not the only country that has full or partial TikTok bans in place. Partial bans are usually limited to government or public sector employees. Full bans apply to all citizens.\n\nSome countries have full or partial bans on TikTok, including Afghanistan, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, European Union, France, India, Iran, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Nepal, New Zealand, Norway, Somalia and United Kingdom.\n\nOther countries have banned TikTok in the past and have since rescinded the bans. Two examples are Indonesia and Pakistan, which both banned the application temporarily due to explicit content. Will Zimbabwe follow suit? I wonder!",

Officials estimated the northern California campus' total damage to be upwards of $1 million.\n\nPresident Joe Biden believes students occupying an academic building is \"absolutely the wrong approach,\" and \"not an example of peaceful protest,\" said National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby.\n\nPeople are also reading...

As cease-fire negotiations appeared to gain steam, it wasn't clear whether those talks would inspire an easing of protests.\n\nNorthwestern University notched a rare win when officials said they reached a compromise with students and faculty who represent the majority of protesters on its campus near Chicago to allow peaceful demonstrations through the end of spring classes.\n\nThe nationwide campus protests began at Columbia in response to Israel's offensive in Gaza after Hamas launched a deadly attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7. Militants killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took roughly 250 hostages. Vowing to stamp out Hamas, Israel has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, according to the local health ministry.\n\nIsrael and its supporters have branded the university protests as antisemitic, while Israel's critics say it uses those allegations to silence opposition. Although some protesters have been caught on camera making antisemitic remarks or violent threats, organizers of the protests, some of whom are Jewish, say it is a peaceful movement aimed at defending Palestinian rights and protesting the war.\n\nOn Columbia's campus, protesters locked arms early Tuesday and carried furniture and metal barricades to Hamilton Hall, among several buildings that were occupied during a 1968 civil rights and anti-Vietnam War protest. Demonstrators called the building Hind's Hall, honoring a young girl who was killed in Gaza under Israeli fire.\n\nDespite the chaos overnight, NYPD brass said Tuesday that officers won't enter Columbia's campus without the college administration's request or an imminent emergency.\n\nThe takeover came hours after protesters had shrugged off an earlier ultimatum to abandon a tent encampment Monday or be suspended -- restricted from all academic and recreational spaces, allowed only to enter their residences, and, for seniors, ineligible to graduate.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nMahmoud Khalil, a lead negotiator before talks with the administration broke down over the weekend, was among the suspended students. His suspension letter -- which he shared with The Associated Press -- said he had refused to leave the encampment after prior warnings, but Khalil said he had abided by the university's demand to vacate the encampment on the campus lawn by the Monday afternoon deadline.\n\nColumbia spokesperson Ben Chang said in a statement that anyone occupying Hamilton Hall risked being expelled from the university for escalating the protest \"to an untenable situation -- vandalizing property, breaking doors and windows, and blockading entrances.\"\n\nA CU Apartheid Divest spokesperson who declined to give her name Tuesday said she had been suspended and is not allowed back on campus. While she said she was not a representative for the demonstrators who had seized Hamilton Hall, she said other protesters' commitment wouldn't waver despite the risk to their educations and careers.\n\n\"We are willing to take on an extremely minor amount of risk compared to what the heroic people of Gaza are dealing with every single day,\" she said.\n\nOccupying protesters have insisted they will remain in Hamilton Hall until the university agrees to three demands -- divestment, financial transparency and amnesty -- even as Columbia administrators threatened repercussions from suspension to expulsion.\n\nIlana Lewkovitch, a self-described \"leftist Zionist\" student at Columbia, said it's been hard to concentrate on school for weeks, amid calls for Zionists to die or leave campus. Her exams have been punctuated with chants of \"say it loud, say it clear, we want Zionists out of here\" in the background, she said.\n\nLewkovitch, who identifies as Jewish and studied at Columbia's Tel Aviv campus, said she wished the current pro-Palestinian protests were more open to people like her who criticize Israel's war policies but believe there should be an Israeli state.\n\nWhile people involved in the Columbia demonstrations acknowledge that some people not part of the university community have participated, they forcefully disputed Adams' allegation that outsiders are driving or unduly influencing the protests.\n\nNumerous students and faculty who have spoken to the AP say the protests are student-led and that the great majority of people participating in them are students.\n\nNYPD officials made similar claims about \"outside agitators\" during the huge, grassroots demonstrations against racial injustice that erupted across the city after the death of George Floyd in 2020. In some instances, top police officials falsely labeled peaceful marches organized by well-known neighborhood activists as the work of violent extremists.\n\nMattise reported from Nashville, Tennessee. Associated Press journalists around the country contributed to this report, including Karen Matthews, Jim Vertuno, Hannah Schoenbaum, Sarah Brumfield, Stefanie Dazio, Christopher Weber, Carolyn Thompson, Dave Collins, Makiya Seminera, Philip Marcelo and Corey Williams.\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Columbia University has not canceled its main graduation event.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

        "text": "Beats has announced its cheapest pair of wireless earbuds to date in an eye-catching transparent red colour, but the £79.95 Solo Buds are missing something most other rivals have. Their carry case does not have a battery in it so the buds don't recharge when you pop them back in the case - you have to put them in and connect the case to a charger.\n\nThis is of course how you would charge the case and buds back up normally, but without a battery in the case, you must always plug into USB-C power if you want to top the buds up at all, unlike virtually all other Bluetooth buds which have a battery in the case for on-the-go top ups. Beats seems to have made this decision for two reasons: to make the buds and case as small as possible, and because the Apple-owned company claims the Solo Buds have 18 hours of battery life when fully juiced up.\n\nThat's double the battery life of the very cool fully transparent Beats Studio Buds Plus that came out last year. If you didn't like the £179 price tag, the transparent red Solo Buds are your route into the see-through Beats life for £100 less - though here only the case is transparent, not the solid red buds themselves. You can also opt for (fully opaque) black, grey or purple.\n\nBeats says it has improved audio performance thanks to \"[e]rgonomically designed acoustic nozzles and laser-cut vents,\" so there you go. The buds, which are the first ever in the company's Solo range, come with four tip sizes to hopefully suit most ears, but lack any sort of active noise cancellation (ANC) tech. That's a shame despite the price, as the Nothing Ear (a) have decent ANC for £99. The Beats Solo Buds go on sale in June for £79.95.\n\nBeats also announced the Beats Solo 4, the long-awaited sequel to the firm's wildly popular Solo 3 Wireless that came out all the way back in 2016. That's a long time to wait for a new pair - Beats had to put 'Wireless' in the product name eight years ago because Bluetooth headphones were not yet mainstream.\n\nWith the Beats Solo 4 that's not the case. The over-ear cans come in black, blue or pink and are notably lightweight at just 217 grams. Beats has added Personalised Spatial Audio, just like on 2023's pricier Beats Studio Pro headphones and the latest AirPods Pro, as well as dynamic head tracking to centre the music in front of you if you wish.\n\nThe Solo 4 charge via USB-C and, like the Studio Pro, can play lossless quality hi-res audio over the cable connection. They also have a 3.5mm headphone jack and come with the cord so you can plug in and use them even if they have run out of battery. There's no noise cancellation though - that's a shame for the £199.95 asking price, but also the design is on-ear, not over-ear, so ANC was never really on the cards as the ear cups don't cover your whole ear. They are available to order today.\n\nThe Solo Buds and Solo 4 can fast pair to both iOS and Android devices, continuing Beats's tactic of catering to both smartphone camps despite being owned by Apple. They can also be added to Apple Find My or Google Find My Device networks if you lose or misplace them.\n\nREAD SOURCE",

        "text": "Christopher Nolan's relationship with Warner Bros. ended because of a sharp difference of opinion over the future of the film industry.\n\nSummary The end of a long partnership between Nolan and Warner Bros. led to Nolan's successful move to Universal Pictures. Nolan's decision to bring Oppenheimer to Universal was met with great success, resulting in critical acclaim and financial gain. Despite Warner Bros.' desire to have Nolan back, Universal's fulfillment of Nolan's demands has proven to be highly beneficial for both parties.\n\nAfter Christopher Nolan achieved a career breakthrough with his sophomore feature directorial outing, the 2000 psychological thriller film Memento, Nolan became attached to Warner Bros. Pictures, which enabled Nolan to make a seamless transition to studio film-making with the 2002 psychological thriller Insomnia. Nolan followed Insomnia with the 2005 origin film Batman Begins, the first installment in Nolan's The Dark Knight trilogy. Throughout the trilogy and with the adjoining Nolan films Dunkirk, Inception, Interstellar, and The Prestige, Warner Bros. gave Nolan unprecedented budgetary and creative freedom. This resulted in one of the most successful partnerships in history.\n\nHowever, in the spring of 2021, the nearly 20-year relationship between Nolan and Warner Bros. ended when Nolan, who had never had a formal production deal with Warner Bros., began meeting with other studios for the distribution and financing of his next film. In September 2021, it was announced that Nolan's next film, Oppenheimer, would be distributed and financed by Universal Pictures for a July 2023 release.\n\nIn April 2022, Warner Bros. announced that the studio's big 2023 film, Barbie, would also be released in July 2023, on the same day as Oppenheimer. While Nolan refused to speculate about the timing, many people thought that this represented an attempt by Warner Bros. to hurt the box-office performance of Oppenheimer. Of course, if this was the intention, the strategy had precisely the opposite effect.\n\nChristopher Nolan and Warner Bros. Clashed Over Streaming Oppenheimer R Where to Watch\n\n*Availability in US\n\nstreamrentbuy\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\n5/5\n\nRelease Date July 21, 2023 Director Christopher Nolan Cast Cillian Murphy , Matt Damon , Robert Downey Jr. , Emily Blunt , Florence Pugh , Gary Oldman , Josh Hartnett , Jack Quaid , Kenneth Branagh , Rami Malek , Alex Wolff , Matthew Modine Runtime 180 Minutes Main Genre Biography Writers Kai Bird , Christopher Nolan , Martin J. Sherwin\n\nThe relationship between Christopher Nolan and Warner Bros. deteriorated in 2020 over the handling of the theatrical release of Nolan's final Warner Bros. film, Tenet, and the studio's ill-fated decision to simultaneously release their films theatrically and through the HBO Max streaming service. With Tenet, Nolan was disappointed that the studio moved the film from its initial July 2020 release, with July being a favorite month of release for Nolan, to September 2020, amid the height of the global pandemic. Additionally, Nolan wasn't happy with the marketing campaign for Tenet, which posted a theatrical financial loss after grossing approximately $363 million at the worldwide box office against a production cost of $200 million.\n\nHowever, the main point of contention between Nolan and Warner Bros. arose in December 2020, when WarnerMedia CEO Jason Kilar, who became CEO in May 2020 and had no prior relationship with Nolan, announced a plan to give all the studio's 2021 films simultaneous releases. This elicited an outraged reaction from Nolan. In a December 2020 statement, Nolan said:\n\n\"Some of our industry's biggest filmmakers and most important movie stars went to bed the night before thinking they were working for the greatest movie studio and woke up to find out they were working for the worst streaming service.\"\n\nUniversal Met Nolan's Big Demands\n\nChristopher Nolan met with several studios in 2021 regarding the distribution and financing of Oppenheimer, including Apple, Paramount, Sony, and the eventual winner, Universal, which proved to be the only studio able and willing to agree to Nolan's steep demands. One of the reasons why Nolan brought Oppenheimer to Universal was Nolan's warm relationship with Universal chairperson Donna Langley, with whom Nolan previously collaborated during an attempt to adapt the classic television series The Prisoner into a feature film. Langley also professed to share Nolan's traditionalist stance on film distribution.\n\nRelated Why Christopher Nolan Is One of the Best Working Directors Today We look at why Christopher Nolan's work keeps people talking.\n\nTo complete the deal with Nolan, Universal agreed to give Oppenheimer an equal marketing and production budget of $100 million, along with Nolan's customary complete creative control, a whopping 20 percent cut of the film's first-dollar gross, a 100-day theatrical window, and a blackout period in which Universal wouldn't release another film within three weeks of the release of Oppenheimer.\n\nThis partnership couldn't have worked out better for Nolan and Universal, as Oppenheimer, which grossed nearly $1 billion at the worldwide box office, became the third-highest-grossing film of 2023 and won seven Academy Awards, including Best Director and Best Picture Oscars for Nolan.\n\nWarner Bros. Wants Nolan Back Close\n\nThe relationship between Christopher Nolan and Warner Bros. Pictures began to thaw in April 2022, when Jason Kilar, the symbol of Nolan's discontent with the studio and its streaming release strategy, left his post as CEO of the now defunct WarnerMedia, now Warner Bros. Discovery, and was replaced by David Zaslav, who appointed filmmaker-friendly executives Pamela Abdy and Michael De Luca as the studio's co-chairpersons.\n\nNolan has expressed support for the leadership of Abdy and De Luca and their vision for Warner Bros. Pictures, while Abdy and De Luca have made no secret of their desire for Nolan to return to the studio. Last year, in an obvious attempt to foster goodwill between the studio and Nolan, Warner Bros. gave Nolan a seven-figure royalty check for Tenet.\n\nRelated How Oppenheimer is the Culmination of Christopher Nolan's Career From Memento to Interstellar, Dunkirk and Tenet, all of Christopher Nolan's films have prepared him for tackling the story of Oppenheimer.\n\nHowever, despite Nolan's respect for Abdy and De Luca and Nolan's stated willingness to work with Warner Bros. in the future, Universal hasn't given Nolan any reason to take his future films elsewhere. Indeed, in addition to winning his first Academy Awards for Oppenheimer, Nolan has also reportedly earned in excess of $70 million from Oppenheimer, under the terms of Nolan's box-office sharing agreement with Universal, which has also profited from its relationship with Nolan in various ways, including the satisfaction of having taken the world's leading filmmaker away from its biggest rival.",

        "text": "Even after thousands of years, the power of the roman empire continues to fascinate people. With some even going as far as to recreate it on film.\n\nThere have been countless movies loosely reiterating epic moments in history - but none have compared to that of Russell Crowe's, Gladiator.\n\nThe 2000s Oscar-winning movie, directed by Ridley Scott, follows the downfall of Roman general Maximus Decimus Meridius who was betrayed by Commodus, the ambitious son of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius.\n\nMaximus once asked: \"Are you not entertained?\"\n\nAnd it is clear audiences are still entertained 24 years later as a second instalment arrives later in 2024. With anticipation building for Gladiator II, we've done a deep dive to answer all your burning questions - including where you can watch the first film in Australia.\n\nThe second instalment of Gladiator will take place more than 20 years after the original movie. It is expected to follow a now-grown Lucius, the son of Lucilla, as he takes on Maximus' legacy.\n\nIt has been reported Lucius will be fighting in the ring as his political ties haunt him. It was his birthright to ascend as a Caesar but decided to carry on Maximus' legacy following his brave sacrifice.\n\nAs of yet, nothing has been set in stone regarding the plot for Gladiator II. The trailer for the second movie debuted at CinemaCon in mid-April, but it has yet to be revealed to an international audience.\n\nAustralian's own Russell Crowe starred as Maximus in the first rendition of Gladiator. However, given the characters tragic end, he will not be returning.\n\nThe cast members returning however for the second film include Connie Nielsen, Spencer Treat Clarke, Dijmon Hounsou and May Calamawy.\n\nTaking up the lead as Lucius is Hollywood favourite Paul Mescal. Joining him his Denzel Washington, Pedro Pascal, Barry Keoghan and Joseph Quinn.\n\nGladiator 2 has been scheduled to release in theatres on November 22, 2024. However, films commonly release earlier in Australia than the U.S. so this could change closer to the date.\n\nRidley Scott's Gladiator is loosely based on real events in ancient Rome. The film is accurate is some areas, it predominately took inspiration from the time.\n\nMaximus Decimus Meridius was not a real person but was inspired by the Roman general Marcus Nonius Macrinus - a general, statesman and advisor during Marcus Aurelius' reign from 161 to 180AD. The character was also believed to be inspired by Cincinnatus, Marcus Nonius Macrunis, Lucius Annaeus Seneca, Tiberius Claudius Pompeianus.\n\nAs for Commodus, son to Marcus Aurelius, he wasn't a fair ruler, his lust for power was dramatised. He did however ascend the throne for a decade following his father's death.\n\nFor fans itching to watch the second instalment, they can refresh their memory by watching Gladiator on Binge and Apple TV in Australia.",

Officials estimated the northern California campus' total damage to be upwards of $1 million.\n\nPresident Joe Biden believes students occupying an academic building is \"absolutely the wrong approach,\" and \"not an example of peaceful protest,\" said National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Thompson talks about California's property insurance crisis\n\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams claimed Tuesday that the Columbia protests have been \"co-opted by professional outside agitators.\" The mayor didn't provide specific evidence to back up that contention, which was disputed by protest organizers and participants.\n\n\"Walk away from this situation now and continue your advocacy through other means,\" Adams advised the protesters. \"This must end now.\"\n\nOther colleges have sought to negotiate agreements with the demonstrators in the hopes of having peaceful commencement ceremonies. As cease-fire negotiations appeared to gain steam, it wasn't clear whether those talks would inspire an easing of protests.\n\nNorthwestern University notched a rare win when officials said they reached a compromise with students and faculty who represent the majority of protesters on its campus near Chicago to allow peaceful demonstrations through the end of spring classes.\n\nThe nationwide campus protests began at Columbia in response to Israel's offensive in Gaza after Hamas launched a deadly attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7. Militants killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took roughly 250 hostages. Vowing to stamp out Hamas, Israel has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, according to the local health ministry.\n\nIsrael and its supporters have branded the university protests as antisemitic, while Israel's critics say it uses those allegations to silence opposition. Although some protesters have been caught on camera making antisemitic remarks or violent threats, organizers of the protests, some of whom are Jewish, say it is a peaceful movement aimed at defending Palestinian rights and protesting the war.\n\nOn Columbia's campus, protesters locked arms early Tuesday and carried furniture and metal barricades to Hamilton Hall, among several buildings that were occupied during a 1968 civil rights and anti-Vietnam War protest. Demonstrators called the building Hind's Hall, honoring a young girl who was killed in Gaza under Israeli fire.\n\nDespite the chaos overnight, NYPD brass said Tuesday that officers won't enter Columbia's campus without the college administration's request or an imminent emergency.\n\nThe takeover came hours after protesters had shrugged off an earlier ultimatum to abandon a tent encampment Monday or be suspended -- restricted from all academic and recreational spaces, allowed only to enter their residences, and, for seniors, ineligible to graduate.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nMahmoud Khalil, a lead negotiator before talks with the administration broke down over the weekend, was among the suspended students. His suspension letter -- which he shared with The Associated Press -- said he had refused to leave the encampment after prior warnings, but Khalil said he had abided by the university's demand to vacate the encampment on the campus lawn by the Monday afternoon deadline.\n\nColumbia spokesperson Ben Chang said in a statement that anyone occupying Hamilton Hall risked being expelled from the university for escalating the protest \"to an untenable situation -- vandalizing property, breaking doors and windows, and blockading entrances.\"\n\nA CU Apartheid Divest spokesperson who declined to give her name Tuesday said she had been suspended and is not allowed back on campus. While she said she was not a representative for the demonstrators who had seized Hamilton Hall, she said other protesters' commitment wouldn't waver despite the risk to their educations and careers.\n\n\"We are willing to take on an extremely minor amount of risk compared to what the heroic people of Gaza are dealing with every single day,\" she said.\n\nOccupying protesters have insisted they will remain in Hamilton Hall until the university agrees to three demands -- divestment, financial transparency and amnesty -- even as Columbia administrators threatened repercussions from suspension to expulsion.\n\nIlana Lewkovitch, a self-described \"leftist Zionist\" student at Columbia, said it's been hard to concentrate on school for weeks, amid calls for Zionists to die or leave campus. Her exams have been punctuated with chants of \"say it loud, say it clear, we want Zionists out of here\" in the background, she said.\n\nLewkovitch, who identifies as Jewish and studied at Columbia's Tel Aviv campus, said she wished the current pro-Palestinian protests were more open to people like her who criticize Israel's war policies but believe there should be an Israeli state.\n\nWhile people involved in the Columbia demonstrations acknowledge that some people not part of the university community have participated, they forcefully disputed Adams' allegation that outsiders are driving or unduly influencing the protests.\n\nNumerous students and faculty who have spoken to the AP say the protests are student-led and that the great majority of people participating in them are students.\n\nNYPD officials made similar claims about \"outside agitators\" during the huge, grassroots demonstrations against racial injustice that erupted across the city after the death of George Floyd in 2020. In some instances, top police officials falsely labeled peaceful marches organized by well-known neighborhood activists as the work of violent extremists.\n\nMattise reported from Nashville, Tennessee.

The American short hair with calico and Siamese coloring has been a constant companion and source of emotional support.\n\n\"I've been through a bunch of health things and she and I have gone through all of that together.

Its earnings report Thursday said profit rose 20% for the January-March quarter as it tries to position itself as a leader in applying artificial intelligence technology to make workplaces more productive.\n\n\"This new generation of AI is reshaping how people live and work everywhere, including in Indonesia,\" said Nadella, in Jakarta on the first stop of a tour of Southeast Asia.\n\n\"The investments we are announcing today -- spanning digital infrastructure, skilling, and support for developers -- will help Indonesia thrive in this new era,\" he said.\n\nMicrosoft sees Southeast Asia as a growing market and potential location for more AI product development. The rise of AI in the region is expected to significantly impact its economic landscape. A study held by Kearney, a global consulting firm, said that AI could contribute nearly $1 trillion to Southeast Asia's GDP by 2030, of which Indonesia is expected to capture $366 billion.\n\nThe investment announced yesterday will include AI training for 840,000 people, as well as support for Indonesia's growing community of tech developers.\n\nIndonesia is home to the third-largest developer community in the Asia-Pacific region after India and China. More than 3.1 million developers in Indonesia use GitHub, a Microsoft-owned platform for software development, collaboration, and innovation. It is projected to be one of the top five developer communities on GitHub globally by 2026.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook met Widodo on April 17 and said the company would \"look at\" manufacturing in Indonesia.\n\nIndonesia, under President Joko Widodo's administration, has emphasized development of digital technology and information sectors, aiming to achieve the government's Golden Indonesia 2045 Vision, which projects Indonesia becoming one of the world's top five economies with GDP of up to $9 trillion, exactly a century after it won independence from Dutch colonizers.\n\nNadella met Widodo in the Presidential Palace. During the meeting, Widodo proposed building an AI research center in Indonesia, and a Microsoft data center based in Bali or Nusantara, the country's new capital city on Borneo island, according to Indonesia's Minister of Communication and Information Technology, Budi Arie Setiadi.",

        "text": "BEIJING (AP) -- China's vision of the future of the automobile -- electrified and digitally connected -- is on display at the ongoing Beijing auto show.\n\nOrganizers say that 117 new models are making their debut at Auto China 2024, which runs through May 4. They range from eye-poppingly cutting edge to more subtle novelties.\n\nTHE CONNECTED CAR\n\nOne of the biggest mob scenes was for the opening day presentation by Xiaomi, a major Chinese maker of smartphones and trendy, affordable smart appliances aimed at younger generations that's entering the car market for the first time.\n\nXiaomi announced that it had received more than 75,000 orders in the four weeks since the launch of its first car, the SU7, with a list price of 215,900 to 299,900 yuan ($29,800-$41,400).\n\nWhy is a phone company making a car? Analysts say connectivity. Consumer technology companies want to connect the lives of their customers across all their devices -- phones, laptops, televisions and now cars.\n\n\"It starts with the concept of the third place,\" said Beatrix Keim, the China director at German auto research center CAR. \"Because nowadays people are at the office, at home and then mainly they're spending the time in the car.\"\n\nThe approach works well in China, a highly digital society where e-payments are the norm and the convenience of connectivity trumps privacy concerns for most.\n\nChinese telecom giant Huawei has ventured into the car business too. Apple explored the idea but dropped it earlier this year.\n\nTHE CAR AS LIVING SPACE\n\nSome Chinese makers are taking the idea of a third space to new heights.\n\nZeekr unveiled the Mix, an electric vehicle with an interior that can transform into a small room while parked. The front seats swivel to face the back ones, with a table in between that a company executive told the crowd could be used to play card games or enjoy a Chinese hot-pot meal.\n\nStefan Sielaff, the design director of Zeekr, described the Mix as \"a nice experiment\" focusing on younger families.\n\n\"I wouldn't even call it a car or an MPV or a van,\" he said. \"It's more a lifestyle capsule. It's an iPod on wheels.\"\n\nIt will be the fifth model for Zeekr, a 2 1/2-year-old premium EV brand of China's Geely group, a major maker that owns Volvo and has designers in Sweden and Shanghai.\n\nThe Mix will go on sale in China by the end of June, the company said. Its selling price has not been announced.\n\nTHE HYBRID APPROACH\n\nAn EV boom in China that started three years ago has eaten into the market for gasoline-powered cars, but they are not dead yet.\n\nSo says Chery Automobile Co., China's biggest exporter, which told its auto show audience that it would continue to develop gasoline cars as well as EVs and hybrids.\n\nIts EXEED Yaoguang C-DM, a hybrid SUV launched last month, was one of four vehicles it highlighted -- two hybrids and two EVs.\n\nThe Yaoguang SUV sells for 159,800 to 225,800 yuan ($22,000-$31,000) in China and is also aimed at overseas markets, a company news release said.\n\nHybrids, which have lagged EVs in China, are now seen as a growth opportunity. Last year, 2.6 million new hybrids were sold in China, about half the number of EVs. Together, they accounted for 36% of the market.\n\nTHE LUXURY TANK\n\nChinese EV maker BYD, known for its low-cost battery technology and cars, is also going after the high-end market in China, defined as 1 million yuan ($140,000) and up.\n\nIts Yangwang brand introduced the latest version of the U8, a monster of an off-road SUV that was launched last September and is designed for survival in rugged conditions. It comes with a satellite phone in case a driver gets stuck beyond cell phone range.\n\nThe U8 is built on a platform that enables it to turn on the spot, like a tank. It's priced at 1.1 million yuan ($150,000). For 100,000 yuan ($13,800) more, buyers can add a built-in drone system.\n\nA SIMPLER APPROACH\n\nVolvo, the Swedish brand now under Geely, offered an answer for those overwhelmed by technology.\n\n\"The current EV market is marked by a prevalent trend of excess and addition,\" said Roger Yu, Volvo's managing director for sales in greater China.\n\nHe introduced the EX30 electric SUV as a user-friendly vehicle with a sophisticated sound system and a tablet screen that are both easy to use.\n\n\"By subtracting for ease of use and adding for safety, Volvo aims to give users the clearest interface, the most user-friendly operation, and the most reassuring intelligent experience,\" he said of the in-car screen.\n\nThe company announced that the EX30 would sell in China for 210,000 to 260,000 yuan ($29,000-$36,000).\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press researcher Yu Bing and video producer Olivia Zhang contributed.",

Officials estimated the northern California campus' total damage to be upwards of $1 million.\n\nPresident Joe Biden believes students occupying an academic building is \"absolutely the wrong approach,\" and \"not an example of peaceful protest,\" said National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Midwesterners, this resort has access to your next best fishing adventure Orion's Lee drafted by the Steelers, the team he grew up cheering for Moline council likely to pass ordinance on accessory dwellings on shared lots\n\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams claimed Tuesday that the Columbia protests have been \"co-opted by professional outside agitators.\" The mayor didn't provide specific evidence to back up that contention, which was disputed by protest organizers and participants.\n\n\"Walk away from this situation now and continue your advocacy through other means,\" Adams advised the protesters. \"This must end now.\"\n\nOther colleges have sought to negotiate agreements with the demonstrators in the hopes of having peaceful commencement ceremonies. As cease-fire negotiations appeared to gain steam, it wasn't clear whether those talks would inspire an easing of protests.\n\nNorthwestern University notched a rare win when officials said they reached a compromise with students and faculty who represent the majority of protesters on its campus near Chicago to allow peaceful demonstrations through the end of spring classes.\n\nThe nationwide campus protests began at Columbia in response to Israel's offensive in Gaza after Hamas launched a deadly attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7. Militants killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took roughly 250 hostages. Vowing to stamp out Hamas, Israel has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, according to the local health ministry.\n\nIsrael and its supporters have branded the university protests as antisemitic, while Israel's critics say it uses those allegations to silence opposition. Although some protesters have been caught on camera making antisemitic remarks or violent threats, organizers of the protests, some of whom are Jewish, say it is a peaceful movement aimed at defending Palestinian rights and protesting the war.\n\nOn Columbia's campus, protesters locked arms early Tuesday and carried furniture and metal barricades to Hamilton Hall, among several buildings that were occupied during a 1968 civil rights and anti-Vietnam War protest. Demonstrators called the building Hind's Hall, honoring a young girl who was killed in Gaza under Israeli fire.\n\nDespite the chaos overnight, NYPD brass said Tuesday that officers won't enter Columbia's campus without the college administration's request or an imminent emergency.\n\nThe takeover came hours after protesters had shrugged off an earlier ultimatum to abandon a tent encampment Monday or be suspended -- restricted from all academic and recreational spaces, allowed only to enter their residences, and, for seniors, ineligible to graduate.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nMahmoud Khalil, a lead negotiator before talks with the administration broke down over the weekend, was among the suspended students.

Officials estimated the northern California campus' total damage to be upwards of $1 million.\n\nPresident Joe Biden believes students occupying an academic building is \"absolutely the wrong approach,\" and \"not an example of peaceful protest,\" said National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby.\n\nPeople are also reading...

As cease-fire negotiations appeared to gain steam, it wasn't clear whether those talks would inspire an easing of protests.\n\nNorthwestern University notched a rare win when officials said they reached a compromise with students and faculty who represent the majority of protesters on its campus near Chicago to allow peaceful demonstrations through the end of spring classes.\n\nThe nationwide campus protests began at Columbia in response to Israel's offensive in Gaza after Hamas launched a deadly attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7. Militants killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took roughly 250 hostages. Vowing to stamp out Hamas, Israel has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, according to the local health ministry.\n\nIsrael and its supporters have branded the university protests as antisemitic, while Israel's critics say it uses those allegations to silence opposition. Although some protesters have been caught on camera making antisemitic remarks or violent threats, organizers of the protests, some of whom are Jewish, say it is a peaceful movement aimed at defending Palestinian rights and protesting the war.\n\nOn Columbia's campus, protesters locked arms early Tuesday and carried furniture and metal barricades to Hamilton Hall, among several buildings that were occupied during a 1968 civil rights and anti-Vietnam War protest. Demonstrators called the building Hind's Hall, honoring a young girl who was killed in Gaza under Israeli fire.\n\nDespite the chaos overnight, NYPD brass said Tuesday that officers won't enter Columbia's campus without the college administration's request or an imminent emergency.\n\nThe takeover came hours after protesters had shrugged off an earlier ultimatum to abandon a tent encampment Monday or be suspended -- restricted from all academic and recreational spaces, allowed only to enter their residences, and, for seniors, ineligible to graduate.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nMahmoud Khalil, a lead negotiator before talks with the administration broke down over the weekend, was among the suspended students. His suspension letter -- which he shared with The Associated Press -- said he had refused to leave the encampment after prior warnings, but Khalil said he had abided by the university's demand to vacate the encampment on the campus lawn by the Monday afternoon deadline.\n\nColumbia spokesperson Ben Chang said in a statement that anyone occupying Hamilton Hall risked being expelled from the university for escalating the protest \"to an untenable situation -- vandalizing property, breaking doors and windows, and blockading entrances.\"\n\nA CU Apartheid Divest spokesperson who declined to give her name Tuesday said she had been suspended and is not allowed back on campus.

Everett Dirksen is credited with the famous phrase \"a billion here, a billion there, and pretty soon you're talking real money.\"\n\nThe senator from Illinois, who died in 1969, was supposedly complaining about excessive federal spending, and while some dispute that he actually said those words, the line has found a place in history.\n\nRelated: Analyst updates SoFi stock outlook after earnings\n\nMichael Saylor also knows a thing or two about real money.\n\nThe co-founder and executive chairman of MicroStrategy (MSTR) once lost $6 billion in a single day back in 2020, after the business-intelligence company announced accounting mistakes and the stock dropped.\n\nSaylor, who stepped down as MicroStrategy's CEO in 2022, reached a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission that included an $8.3 million personal disgorgement.\n\nHe has also been a bitcoin evangelist, and he spoke about the primary digital currency during MicroStrategy's first-quarter-earnings call.\n\n\"This quarter,\" he said, \"it's the end of the crypto childhood or the crypto cowboy era, where you had had 15 years of lots of confusion, chaos, and jockeying of thousands and thousands of crypto assets.\"\n\n\"Well, bitcoin is the winner, and it is the one emergent institutional asset that has come out of that 15 years,\" Saylor said.\n\nMicroStrategy's co-founder calls bitcoin 'unique'\n\nInvestors' interest in bitcoin soared with January's introduction of bitcoin exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, particularly the ones offered by BlackRock and Fidelity Investments.\n\n\"And so, bitcoin is very unique,\" Saylor said. \"It's the one crypto asset that a publicly traded company can hold on its balance sheet, can capitalize upon.\"\n\nRelated: Analyst revamps Apple stock rating ahead of key earnings report\n\nSaylor maintained that entire modern institutional asset economy, the options market, the securities market, the money manager system, the institutional mutual funds, the institutional ETFs, are all going to be centered around bitcoin as the digital property going forward.\n\n\"And so, while we're at the end of the beginning, you know, we're now, I would say, at the beginning of the middle,\" he said.\n\nMicroStrategy posted a first-quarter loss of $3.09 per share on April 29, swinging from earnings of $31.79 a year earlier and missing the FactSet analyst consensus calling for a loss of 55 cents a share.\n\nThe latest result reflected a $192 million bitcoin impairment charge, \"the result of bitcoin price fluctuations throughout this past quarter,\" the company said. The charge in the year-earlier period was $20 million.\n\nRevenue totaled $115 million, down from $126 million a year earlier and short of FactSet's call for $121.7 million.\n\nBitcoin was down 3% to $60,864 at last check, while MicroStrategy was tumbling 15.5% to $1,092. The company's executives still pledged their allegiance to crypto.\n\nAndrew Kang, MicroStrategy's chief financial officer, said the company was the world's largest corporate holder of bitcoin, \"and we remain committed to our bitcoin acquisition strategy with the utmost conviction, long-term focus, and with a strong risk-managed approach.\"\n\nCEO: 'we're highly committed to bitcoin strategy'\n\nPresident and CEO Phong Le told analysts \"we remain highly committed to our bitcoin strategy with a long-term focus.\"\n\n\"This past quarter, the price of bitcoin appreciated significantly, spurred notably by the approval of the spot bitcoin exchange-traded products or ETPs, which has drawn considerable institutional attention,\" he said.\n\nMore Tech Stocks:\n\nCathie Wood buys $22 million of battered tech stockAnalyst revamps Nvidia price target as Mag 7 earnings loomAnalyst unveils new Amazon price target as stock tests $2 trillion\n\nHe said the company believed that the introduction of spot bitcoin ETPs \"further evidences the maturation of bitcoin as an institutional grade asset class with broader regulatory recognition and institutional adoption.\"\n\nCanaccord lowered its price target on MicroStrategy to $1,590 from $1,810 while affirming a buy rating on the shares.\n\nThe investment firm said the company's strategy was again in full swing in the first quarter, given the approvals of U.S.-listed spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nMicroStrategy raised more than $1.5 billion in the first quarter and used the proceeds to acquire an additional 25,250 bitcoin. It now owns 214,400 BTC valued around $13.6 billion, Canaccord told investors in a research report.\n\nBitcoin recently marked its fourth halving, where the reward for mining the crypto is split in half. Halvings reduce the rate at which new coins are created, lowering the available amount of new supply.\n\nCanaccord said that with the recent halving event, the amount of new bitcoin mined per day has been reduced by 50%.\n\nRelated: Veteran fund manager picks favorite stocks for 2024",

First St.\n\nThe property's period of historic significance is listed as 1919 to 1973.\n\nThe 2.48-acre property was known as the Ziglar Sheds for tobacco leaf storage, according to the registration form. They are not currently in use.\n\nThe commission said a registration form has been completed for the property by Heather Fearnbach of Fearnbach History Services Inc. of Winston-Salem. The form is scheduled to be presented to the state's National Register Advisory Committee on June 13.\n\nThe property owner is listed as RDG Acquisitions Inc. and Susana Dancy of Carrboro.\n\nThe buildings were completed in the 1920s.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"Both manifest standard features of early 20th-century storage buildings designed by R.

Myers Trading Post Inc. bought the buildings as Reynolds' need for them diminished as part of moving production to its Whitaker Park plant.\n\nMyriad warehousing businesses and a recycling company rented portions of the building until C.W. Myers transferred the property to RDG Acquisitions LLC in November 2021.\n\nThere are 116 Forsyth County properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nOn the list are the former R.J.

Total Q1 earnings for these companies are up +3.1% from the same period last year on +3.9% higher revenues, with 79% beating EPS estimates and 59.9% beating revenue estimates.\n\nThe proportion of these companies beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 52.8%. The 52.8% 'blended' beats percentage compares to 53.4% for this group of 267 index members in 2024 Q4, 55.8% in each of the two preceding periods, and the average for this group of companies over the preceding 20 quarters (five years) of 59%.\n\nExcluding the Energy sector drag, whose Q1 earnings are down -29.8%, total earnings for the rest of the index that has reported results would be up +6.8%.\n\nLooking at Q1 as a whole, combining the actual results that have come out with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total earnings are on track to be up +3.9% on +4.1% higher revenues. Excluding the Energy sector, Q1 earnings would be up +6.7% on +4.5% higher revenues.\n\nToday's Featured Analyst Reports\n\nApple shares have lagged the broader market as well as the Tech sector this year, reflecting competitive pressures and the uncertain China outlook. Growing legal complexities, including ongoing EPIC and Masimo lawsuits and the latest case by the U.S. Department of Justice, have been a headwind.\n\nUnfavorable forex is expected to have hurt fiscal second-quarter revenues by 2% on a year-over-year basis. Nevertheless, the Services segment is expected to report strong results, driven by solid adoption of Apple TV+, Apple Pay, and Apple Music. The updated MacBook and iMac lineup has helped Apple gain a share in the PC market.\n\nThe launch of Apple Vision Pro, a spatial computer that blends digital content with the physical world, has expanded Apple's non-iPhone portfolio. The company's strong cash balance and shareholder-friendly approach to dividends and share repurchase are noteworthy.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>>)\n\nShares of Walmart have modestly outperformed the Zacks Retail - Supermarkets industry over the past year (+21.0% vs. +20.2%). The company gaining from its highly diversified business with contributions from various segments, channels, and formats. Walmart has been benefiting from an increase in in-store and digital channel traffic due to its robust omnichannel initiatives. Store-fulfilled delivery sales jumped 50% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nThe strategic focus on enhancing delivery services has also been rewarding, as evidenced by the constant increase in the market share for groceries. Upsides like these, along with growth in the advertising business, fueled Walmart's fourth-quarter results and led to an encouraging fiscal 2025 view.\n\nHowever, the retail landscape continues to be dynamic due to challenges like inflation and volatile consumer spending. High SG&A expenses are also a concern.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Walmart here >>>)\n\nChevron shares have gained +3.5% over the past year against the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry's gain of +9.4%. Despite the underperformance, the company is positioned as one of the top global integrated oil firms, set for sustainable production growth, particularly due to its dominant position in the lucrative Permian Basin. Further, the recent acquisition of Hess Corporation is expected to significantly strengthen Chevron's presence in oil-rich Guyana.\n\nHowever, the company is grappling with lower prices in the upstream segment and declining refining margins in the downstream unit. Another concern is the sub-100% reserve replacement ratio, indicating challenges in replenishing produced energy. Considering all these factors, investors are advised to wait for a better entry point.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Chevron here >>>)\n\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Aon plc (AON), Carrier Global Corporation (CARR), and American Water Works Company, Inc.

        "text": "Apple is gearing up to unveil Safari 18 later this year, and it reportedly will be equipped with an array of features poised to improve the browsing experience. As reported by AppleInsider, the tech giant is testing a version of its Safari web browser, loaded with UI enhancements and an AI-powered tool called Intelligent Search.\n\nIt's expected that these unreleased features, being tested alongside internal builds of iOS 18 and macOS 15, could make their way to the end users as part of Safari 18 later this year, the report says.\n\nSafari's revamped user interface consolidates essential controls into a single, easily accessible page controls menu in the address bar. The menu puts several options such as zoom, reader mode, privacy controls, content blocking, extension shortcuts, Web Eraser, and AI summary tool, in one place.\n\nApple's Intelligent Search could work similarly to the article summary feature available on the Arc browser, as per the publication. The feature is designed to summarize text by identifying key phrases and topics on the webpage.\n\nIntelligent Search supposedly uses Apple's on-device AI technology, specifically the Ajax language-learning model, to deliver AI-enhanced browsing and text summarization. However, on the test builds of Safari 18, the feature needs to be activated manually from the new page controls menu.\n\nAnother feature in the works is called Web Eraser, which is again accessible through the page controls menu. As the name suggests, the feature lets you remove unwanted parts of a web page such as banner ads, text, images, or entire page sections.\n\nThe report says that Web Eraser remembers the content removed from a webpage, It will remain that way even if you close the original tab or window. The erasure tool will remind you about the modifications on your next visit, offering the option to roll back the changes and see the unedited version.\n\nWith that said, Safari isn't the only Apple software getting the AI treatment. It was previously reported that the Cupertino giant is readying generative AI features for iPhone's upcoming software upgrade, namely iOS 18. Apple was also reportedly spending millions of dollars a day on its ChatGPT rival.\n\nSource: AppleInsider",

        "text": "Zhao has an estimated personal net worth of $33 billion, according to Forbes' World's Billionaires list.\n\nChangpeng Zhao, the billionaire co-founder and former CEO of Binance, is expected to see his mammoth wealth remain intact and likely continue to climb even as he faces time behind bars after his sentencing in a Seattle court.\n\nZhao, who is commonly referred to as \"CZ\" in crypto circles, was sentenced to four months in prison on Tuesday, after pleading guilty to charges of enabling money laundering at his crypto exchange.\n\nThe sentence handed down to Zhao in Seattle federal court was significantly less than the three years that federal prosecutors had been seeking for him. The defense had asked for five months of probation. Sentencing guidelines called for a prison term of 12 to 18 months.\n\nA Binance spokesperson said in a statement to CNBC the crypto exchange has made \"considerable compliance enhancements,\" including with regards to anti-money laundering detection and \"hiring key compliance personnel.\"\n\nA lawyer for Zhao did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.\n\nIn November, Zhao struck a deal with the U.S. government to resolve a multiyear investigation into Binance. As part of Binance's $4.3 billion settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice, Zhao stepped down as the company's CEO, and the exchange agreed to form a board of directors with independent members, as well as compliance and audit committees.\n\nOf the seven total directors recently named to the since-formed board of directors, three were designated as being \"independent\" -- and five of them, including all of the board's independent members, submitted letters to the judge in Zhao's criminal case asking for leniency in sentencing.\n\nGabriel Abed, the board's chairman and one of its independent members, told U.S. District Judge Richard Jones that Zhao was \"distinguished by a stoic composure and genuine humility\" and that \"despite his significant achievements,\" he maintained a lifestyle marked by simplicity including dressing in clothes bought on Amazon, driving a Toyota and wearing an Apple watch.\n\nDespite Zhao now facing time in prison, industry experts and lawyers who spoke with CNBC say his tremendous personal wealth will remain unaffected and, if anything, is likely to rise.\n\nLos Angeles corporate law attorney Tre Lovell tells CNBC that the government is only entitled to any restitution or fines imposed and not to Zhao's assets or wealth as a whole. Former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani agrees, adding that Zhao's personal wealth won't be affected by his sentence.\n\n\"Because Zhao and the government came to an agreement, the government didn't get a judgment or restitution order against Zhao and do discovery into his assets,\" said Rahmani. \"He'll have significant wealth when he is released from prison.\"\n\nZhao took Binance, the cryptocurrency exchange he co-founded in 2017, from a relatively obscure company to one of the most formidable players in the booming digital currency space.\n\nDespite the fact that Zhao is being put behind bars, his controlling stake in Binance means that he will continue being one of the wealthiest people in crypto today.\n\nNotably, because Zhao pleaded guilty to only one count of violation of the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), he is regarded as a first-time offender, and thus reached a settlement with federal authorities to step down as CEO and not relinquish his interest in the company or have assets frozen.\n\n\"Typically, personal assets that are not directly linked to the criminal activity might remain unaffected,\" said Braden Perry, a former senior trial lawyer for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. \"His assets could also be managed on his behalf while he is incarcerated.\"\n\nThat's a different siutation from Sam Bankman-Fried, the controversial ex-CEO and founder of crypto exchange FTX. Bankman-Fried, who's commonly referred to as \"SBF,\" saw his wealth reduced to zero after his crypto empire collapsed into bankruptcy in 2022.\n\n\"In relation to CZ's personal wealth ... he would still be able to retain his share in Binance, as well as maintain his crypto holdings which also contribute an unknown, yet material, amount to his overall wealth and net worth,\" Joshua de Vos, research lead at CCData, told CNBC via email.\n\n\"Since there is no misappropriation or bankruptcy proceedings, it is highly unlikely that CZ would see his wealth reduced to zero as was the case with SBF,\" de Vos said.\n\nWhat's more, Zhao has gotten off much easier in sentencing than former crypto rival Bankman-Fried. Bankman-Fried received a 25-year prison term for crimes connected to the operation of his crypto exchange.\n\nUnlike Zhao and the charges brought against Binance, Bankman-Fried's bankrupt exchange faced allegations of fraud and misuse of customers' funds.\n\nExperts say that Zhao's net worth is likely to continue rising as buoyant crypto prices, which tend to support trading activity on Binance, boost his own personal fortune.\n\n\"CZ will now be one of the wealthiest people in prison,\" said Yesha Yadav, law professor and associate dean at Vanderbilt University.\n\nThat's even after a litany of legal troubles, including the Department of Justice's case against it, and several other high-profile lawsuits -- including one from the Securities and Exchange Commission which remains ongoing.\n\nThe SEC has accused Binance of making multiple unregistered offers and sales of crypto asset securities. It is not yet clear when that case will reach a conclusion.\n\nZhao had an estimated personal net worth of $33 billion on March 8, 2024, up from $10.5 billion the same time last year, according to Forbes' World's Billionaires list, which ranks the richest peopole using stock prices and exchange rates.\n\nBloomberg's Billionaires Index, a separate measure of the world's wealthiest, pegs Zhao's net worth at an even higher sum, $42.9 billion.\n\nCNBC was unable to independently verify Zhao's overall net worth.\n\nBut Zhao is widely reported to have an estimated 90% stake in Binance, and his fortune is largely derived from his equity ownership in the company.\n\nBinance is by far the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, processing $18.1 trillion worth of trading volume in 2023, according to data from crypto market data firm CCData.\n\nAround 80% -- or $14.4 trillion -- of that came from derivatives products like futures contracts, while the remaining $3.7 trillion came from spot trading. Derivatives trading is a key part of Binance's business.\n\nAnd even though Binance has seen its market share drop to 41.6% since Zhao stepped down as CEO in November 2023, the company remains the dominant player overall -- leagues ahead of South Korean exchange Upbit, Dubai-headquartered Bybit, and U.S. giant Coinbase.\n\nZhao has said previously he has personal investments in bitcoin and Binance's own BNB token, however he's not disclosed the value of those holdings. Binance Coin, or BNB, is up 83% so far this year to $576.\n\nLucas Kiely, chief investment officer of digital wealth platform Yield App, said that Zhao's \"significant stake in the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume positions him to potentially benefit from the overall growth of the crypto market.\"\n\nThe recent approval of a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund in the U.S. has led to renewed interest in the crypto market, and helped trigger a wave of fresh institutional investment, according to Kiely -- and that's sure to be a boon to Binance.\n\n\"Such developments could contribute to the growth of Binance and, by extension, CZ's wealth,\" he told CNBC.\n\nZhao has been hit with a partial knock to his overall fortune -- he was forced to pay a $50 million fine, in addition to the $4.3 billion in fines and forfeiture Binance was ordered to pay for violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act and sanctions on Iran. Yadav noted that it's also possible Zhao makes some contribution to the billions Binance owes to the government.\n\nYadav tells CNBC that even though CZ's vast wealth is not directly under threat by virtue of his conviction and the sentencing today, there may still be some indirect effects.\n\n\"Negative long-term impact on Binance will diminish the value of CZ's investment in the crypto exchange,\" said Yadav. \"Conversely, however, CZ may even benefit if Binance begins a path to recovery following today's sentencing, the plea deal and monitorship arrangement, and regains its market share over time as a result.\"",

        "text": "iPhone software bug: Apple confirms it's working on an urgent fix - Forbes\n\nApple is set to introduce significant updates to Safari with the upcoming versions of iOS 18 and macOS 15 later this year. Among the new features, according to a recent report, is an AI-based tool called \"Intelligent Search\". This tool will offer features such as page summarization, allowing users to quickly grasp the main points of web content without reading everything. Additionally, a \"Web Eraser\" feature is also set to debut, which could provide users with enhanced privacy controls or content management options on web pages. These updates indicate Apple's commitment to integrating more advanced technology into its browser, improving both functionality and user experience.\n\nNew iOS 18 features for Safari\n\nApple Insider's Marko Zivkovic's report, which outlines potential Safari updates, notes that the \"exact implementation\" of these new features \"remains unclear.\" This suggests that while the features are under development, their final form and functionality are not yet finalized. Given this uncertainty, it would be wise to view these claims with some skepticism until more concrete information becomes available or until Apple provides official confirmation and details about updates.\n\nAccording to Marko Zivkovic's report, Apple is planning an overhaul of the commands menu in Safari's address bar. This new design aims to consolidate existing and new page control tools into one central location, making them more accessible and easier to use. One of the notable additions to this new menu is a feature they call \"Smart Reported Search.\" This tool will improve the browser's search capabilities, possibly incorporating advanced AI technologies to improve how users find and interact with information on the web. The details of how \"smart search\" will work are not yet known, but its inclusion suggests a move toward a smarter, more user-friendly browsing experience.\n\nThe \"Smart Search\" feature, which is part of the upcoming Safari 18, is disabled by default in test builds, but users can enable it from the new address bar menu. Once activated, this tool will be able to identify key topics and phrases in a web page and then generate a summary of its content. This feature aims to simplify the process of quickly absorbing information, making it particularly useful for users browsing extensive or complex content.\n\nAvailability of new Safari browser features\n\nThe report suggests that Apple's goal is to integrate text summarization into Safari 18 later this year, improving the browser's usefulness as a search and reading tool. However, as mentioned earlier, the details of how this feature works remain unclear and the exact details of its implementation are still under development. This \"unclear\" status indicates that while the feature is a promising addition, its final form may still be subject to change as it is tested and refined.\n\nGizchina News of the week\n\nArc, developed by The Browser Company, is another example of how AI technologies are integrating into web browsers, including features like page summarization. This trend highlights the growing emphasis on improving user experience through smart tools that simplify online interactions.\n\nLikewise, the upcoming Safari 18, planned for iOS 18 and macOS 15, could also adopt new AI-based features. One of these features is the \"Web Eraser\". According to Marko Zivkovic, this tool will give users the ability to selectively remove or erase specific parts of web pages. This will be particularly useful for decluttering pages, focusing on specific content, or managing how information is displayed on screen based on user preferences. The \"Web Eraser\" could significantly improve Safari's customization capabilities, making it a more versatile tool for personal web browsing.\n\nTake control of your web browsing\n\nThe upcoming Safari 18's \"Web Eraser\" feature promises to give users more refined control over their web browsing experience by allowing them to selectively remove things like ads, images, and other content from pages Web. This feature mirrors what some third-party ad blockers already offer, but Apple's first-party implementation in iOS 18 and macOS 15 could provide a more seamless and integrated experience.\n\nA notable aspect of \"Web Eraser\" is its ability to remember changes the user makes to a web page for future visits. According to Marko Zivkovic, once a user makes changes to a web page using this feature, Safari will retain those changes and reapply them every time the user revisits that page, even if they close the tab or the original window. This persistence improves user comfort, ensuring that their browsing experience remains consistent from session to session, tailored to their specific preferences and needs. This could significantly improve Safari's usability and appeal as a browser that truly adapts to an individual's browsing habits and requirements.\n\nWhen a user returns to a web page where they previously used the \"Web Eraser\" feature to edit content, Safari will alert them that changes have been made to the page based on their preferences. This notification ensures that users know that the content they are seeing is not the original version but has been personalized based on their previous interactions. Additionally, Safari will provide an option to undo these changes, allowing users to restore the web page to its original, unaltered state if they wish. This feature not only improves user control over their browsing experience, but also adds a layer of flexibility, allowing users to easily switch between edited and original content views based on their current needs or preferences.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, Apple's upcoming Safari update for iOS 18 and macOS 15 promises exciting advancements with AI-powered features such as \"Smart Search\" for page summary and \"Web Eraser\" for control. content. Although details remain under development, these additions suggest a focus on an improved user experience, making Safari a smarter and more personalized browsing tool.\n\nDisclaimer: We may be compensated by some of the companies whose products we discuss, but our articles and reviews are always our honest opinions.

Former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani agrees, adding that Zhao's personal wealth won't be affected by his sentence.\n\n\"Because Zhao and the government came to an agreement, the government didn't get a judgment or restitution order against Zhao and do discovery into his assets,\" said Rahmani. \"He'll have significant wealth when he is released from prison.\"\n\nZhao took Binance, the cryptocurrency exchange he co-founded in 2017, from a relatively obscure company to one of the most formidable players in the booming digital currency space.\n\nDespite the fact that Zhao is being put behind bars, his controlling stake in Binance means that he will continue being one of the wealthiest people in crypto today.\n\nNotably, because Zhao pleaded guilty to only one count of violation of the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), he is regarded as a first-time offender, and thus reached a settlement with federal authorities to step down as CEO and not relinquish his interest in the company or have assets frozen.\n\n\"Typically, personal assets that are not directly linked to the criminal activity might remain unaffected,\" said Braden Perry, a former senior trial lawyer for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. \"His assets could also be managed on his behalf while he is incarcerated.\"\n\nThat's a different siutation from Sam Bankman-Fried, the controversial ex-CEO and founder of crypto exchange FTX. Bankman-Fried, who's commonly referred to as \"SBF,\" saw his wealth reduced to zero after his crypto empire collapsed into bankruptcy in 2022.\n\n\"In relation to CZ's personal wealth ... he would still be able to retain his share in Binance, as well as maintain his crypto holdings which also contribute an unknown, yet material, amount to his overall wealth and net worth,\" Joshua de Vos, research lead at CCData, told CNBC via email.\n\n\"Since there is no misappropriation or bankruptcy proceedings, it is highly unlikely that CZ would see his wealth reduced to zero as was the case with SBF,\" de Vos said.\n\nWhat's more, Zhao has gotten off much easier in sentencing than former crypto rival Bankman-Fried. Bankman-Fried received a 25-year prison term for crimes connected to the operation of his crypto exchange.\n\nUnlike Zhao and the charges brought against Binance, Bankman-Fried's bankrupt exchange faced allegations of fraud and misuse of customers' funds.\n\nExperts say that Zhao's net worth is likely to continue rising as buoyant crypto prices, which tend to support trading activity on Binance, boost his own personal fortune.\n\n\"CZ will now be one of the wealthiest people in prison,\" said Yesha Yadav, law professor and associate dean at Vanderbilt University.\n\nThat's even after a litany of legal troubles, including the Department of Justice's case against it, and several other high-profile lawsuits -- including one from the Securities and Exchange Commission which remains ongoing.\n\nThe SEC has accused Binance of making multiple unregistered offers and sales of crypto asset securities. It is not yet clear when that case will reach a conclusion.\n\nZhao had an estimated personal net worth of $33 billion on March 8, 2024, up from $10.5 billion the same time last year, according to Forbes' World's Billionaires list, which ranks the richest peopole using stock prices and exchange rates.\n\nBloomberg's Billionaires Index, a separate measure of the world's wealthiest, pegs Zhao's net worth at an even higher sum, $42.9 billion.\n\nCNBC was unable to independently verify Zhao's overall net worth.\n\nBut Zhao is widely reported to have an estimated 90% stake in Binance, and his fortune is largely derived from his equity ownership in the company.\n\nBinance is by far the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, processing $18.1 trillion worth of trading volume in 2023, according to data from crypto market data firm CCData.\n\nAround 80% -- or $14.4 trillion -- of that came from derivatives products like futures contracts, while the remaining $3.7 trillion came from spot trading. Derivatives trading is a key part of Binance's business.\n\nAnd even though Binance has seen its market share drop to 41.6% since Zhao stepped down as CEO in November 2023, the company remains the dominant player overall -- leagues ahead of South Korean exchange Upbit, Dubai-headquartered Bybit, and U.S. giant Coinbase.\n\nZhao has said previously he has personal investments in bitcoin and Binance's own BNB token, however he's not disclosed the value of those holdings. Binance Coin, or BNB, is up 83% so far this year to $576.\n\nLucas Kiely, chief investment officer of digital wealth platform Yield App, said that Zhao's \"significant stake in the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume positions him to potentially benefit from the overall growth of the crypto market.\"\n\nThe recent approval of a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund in the U.S. has led to renewed interest in the crypto market, and helped trigger a wave of fresh institutional investment, according to Kiely -- and that's sure to be a boon to Binance.\n\n\"Such developments could contribute to the growth of Binance and, by extension, CZ's wealth,\" he told CNBC.\n\nZhao has been hit with a partial knock to his overall fortune -- he was forced to pay a $50 million fine, in addition to the $4.3 billion in fines and forfeiture Binance was ordered to pay for violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act and sanctions on Iran. Yadav noted that it's also possible Zhao makes some contribution to the billions Binance owes to the government.\n\nYadav tells CNBC that even though CZ's vast wealth is not directly under threat by virtue of his conviction and the sentencing today, there may still be some indirect effects.\n\n\"Negative long-term impact on Binance will diminish the value of CZ's investment in the crypto exchange,\" said Yadav. \"Conversely, however, CZ may even benefit if Binance begins a path to recovery following today's sentencing, the plea deal and monitorship arrangement, and regains its market share over time as a result.\"",

        "text": "If we could start by talking a little bit about the company's history. What are some of the key milestones of your company? What are some of your strengths?\n\nThe company launched in 1991 and by 1992 we had relocated to Shibuya-ku, Tokyo, and had begun our plant business for semiconductor devices. We quickly gained the trust of our customers in the semiconductor industry.\n\nLet me first give you my take on where I've seen the industry go, and more importantly where I see the industry going in the future from the perspective of a president of an SME in Japan.\n\nOur business focused on the manufacture of semiconductor equipment and flat-panel displays (FPD), as well as the sales activities for new equipment and devices that have been imported from abroad. Our business in selling used equipment isn't referred to in the company as used, but rather we like to think of it as renovation technology. This renovation technology business actually has two key parts, first is the trade of used equipment and the other is the engineering of such parts. Additionally, as a sales agent, we introduce advanced systems and products to Japan from overseas.\n\nHow we have evolved to who we are now, really comes down to our history. As I mentioned we were established in 1991 and we are now celebrating our 31st year of business. The firm currently has, annual sales not included, in just 30 years of sales, grown to JPY 25 billion, and by the end of the 2022 fiscal year, we will have hit the JPY 30 billion mark.\n\nThere are 50-70 used equipment traders in Japan in the form of various sizes, and the biggest ones are the famous leasing companies and the comprehensive trading companies. Globally there are 250 used equipment traders. Domestically we are the number one trader of used equipment, and globally we are in the top 5.\n\nGoing back to 1991 when we started the business, used equipment traders had different backgrounds, and in our company's case, we were started by just a single semiconductor engineer who had left their company and started their own consulting business. The consulting conducted was in the manufacturing process for semiconductors, and in order to teach and transfer their knowledge, the consultant went to Taiwan to hold seminars. The audience of those seminars were individuals that wanted to start semiconductor companies in Taiwan, South Korea, and China. To those audience members, that consultant, our company's founder, taught them how to produce semiconductors, how the semiconductor market is operating, and how semiconductor manufacturing equipment should work. So to summarize, our founder was an engineer that was hired by some of Japan's major semiconductor manufacturers.\n\nIn 1991 the economic bubble burst, so Japanese electrical companies suffered from the low utilization of facilities. At that time the small semiconductor manufacturers in Taiwan, South Korea, and China had difficulty funding their production because it required a minimum of JPY 10 billion. The founder was asked by a Taiwanese venture business operator how to procure low-priced equipment. He knew that there were Japanese manufacturers with excess facilities or equipment, but 30 years ago nobody shared the idea of selling used equipment because semiconductors require precision manufacturing. Nobody believed that one-day people would trade used semiconductor manufacturing equipment back then. Now when you compare it to today, the market for used semiconductor manufacturing equipment is JPY 500 billion worldwide, with over 200 used equipment traders. In order to cater to such small businesses in Taiwan, China, and South Korea as well as help those passionate business ventures to start their business, our founder started a brokerage business. Back then our company didn't do anything like disassembling the equipment or engineering services, instead, we asked Japanese sellers such as Tokyo Electron to disassemble them for transportation to other countries, with that transportation commissioned to companies such as Nippon Express. Once parts reach their destination the setup of the equipment or the re-assembly was conducted by the manufacturer, not by ourselves.\n\nFrom 1991-2000 the company served as a broker, and the company's revenue source came from commission fees or margins. The company only employed 3 people, and the revenue was around JPY 1 billion. This may sound small by today's standards, but please remember that this kind of business does not require any upfront investment costs. Our margins were around 1%-5% and that continued for around 10 years. At the time the idea of using used semiconductor manufacturing equipment spread around Japan.\n\nYour firm in the scope of Japan is quite young, with the country being well known for its very old and long-established companies. As such we find that Japanese businesses are very wary of the experienced track record of companies, specifically in the semiconductor industry. Back at the beginning how were you able to convince these large firms to trust your business as a broker?\n\nBack then it was just between the sellers and the buyers, so even if the seller didn't trust us, in the end it came down to who the buyer was. It is possible that some of the semiconductor manufacturing businesses saw us as a kind of shady business.\n\nAs the idea of selling used manufacturing equipment rose there was a movement. Since these devices usually required huge amounts of upfront investment, operators would resort to leasing programs and those leasing companies would buy back the used equipment. However, once the leasing company bought back the equipment, they would usually then depose of the equipment. Around that time, they began to discover that there was a slowly swelling market for used equipment, especially in China and Taiwan. So now we start to see some of the major leasing companies begin to enter this market as well. Once the used equipment market began to grow, it caught the attention of Japanese venture businesses who began to enter. Semiconductor manufacturing companies here that lack the funds for the upfront investments started resorting to the second-hand market.\n\nThe same thing happened in the FPD market as well, and back in the 1990s the market mainly consisted of LCDs. Back then almost all FPDs produced worldwide came from Japan. Japan's LCD business was on the decline and there was a lot of excess capacity and equipment in Japan. Then the Taiwanese and Chinese small companies came to Japan to buy used FPDs.\n\nBy the year 2000, the number of semiconductor manufacturing equipment traders leaped to 40, and that included some large leasing companies. Such traders had different backgrounds, and in the case of our company it was started by a consultant, but many other companies were started by equipment manufacturers and workers from the leasing industry. Around that time the way to play the game had changed, and money was the only thing that mattered. Those major leasing companies had the finances available to buy entire factories of semiconductor manufacturing equipment. Also with the funds they had available to them they were able to partner with trading companies to form groups of different manufacturers together. Our company at the time only had 3 employees and we really were at a disadvantage in terms of corporate finance. In order to survive in the market, we decided to shift our focus to engineering too. We started hiring engineers so that we could break away from only running a brokerage business by buying used products for disassembly and refurbishment. Those were repurposed for sale as new products to customers. In 2005 we hired 30 engineers so at that time we were able to expand the scope of the equipment that we can sell.\n\nOur pool of engineers are all from different Japanese manufacturers like Tokyo Electron, Canon, Sony, NEC, and Toshiba, and in fact, I was the first engineer hired by the company. In my case, I was the fourth employee of the company and the only one hired in their 20s, with the other three employees all being in their 60s.\n\nI used to work for an LCD R&D venture but the company decided to close the business. They wanted to find a buyer for all the equipment they had and through that, they met the founder of Hightec Systems, who talked to me and mentioned how they were looking to increase the number of engineers they had at their company. I then brought in 10 more engineers with me and those engineers were internally promoted along with myself. Needless to say, it was not easy because no one had any experience with dismantling and refurbishing equipment. Despite this, however, we have a passion to serve customers that have a passion to grow their businesses.\n\nOur company wanted to increase our product lineup for the customers, and I have expertise in LCDs so I am engaged in the LCD business, and my colleague is engaged in the semiconductor business. That colleague is now the senior executive officer of the company. By developing our processes with the customers we have been able to cover the entire process from purchasing all the way to equipment that is ready for use.\n\nAnother turning point was in 2005 when we established a subsidiary in South Korea. With companies like Samsung and LG, when purchasing new equipment from Japanese companies they always include a clause in the contract which says that Japanese companies must dispatch their personnel to their South Korean offices so that they can train local employees to the extent in which they will be able to maintain the equipment on their own. Such engineers that were trained by Japanese manufacturers have become independent and started their own engineering companies for maintenance. Depending on which area they receive training in, they developed their own expertise and companies. Usually, such engineering companies established by former engineers provide services to Samsung or LG, so I approached them to work with us in order to establish a Korean version of our business model.\n\nWith their expertise, we were able to handle the equipment that Hightec Systems couldn't handle. It works in a complimentary manner creating synergy between the companies.\n\nSince 2010 our sales have grown because of the expansion of equipment in our lineup. In 2008 we established the Fuji Technical Center, which also has a clean room used for maintenance. The Fuji Technical Center is located in Susono city, Shizuoka. Around that time we started receiving inquiries for maintenance work and relocation engineering work. It meant that inquiries had shifted from equipment to engineering-related services.\n\nWhen I first started here at Hightec Systems almost nobody knew of the company, but Japanese companies really value a track record, and other companies didn't open any doors for new commerce. We had difficulty dealing with long-established companies, so I visited almost every prefecture and visited almost every semiconductor and LCD manufacturer over a period of 2 years. If a place turned me down I would visit them again and again until they allowed me in. As a matter of fact, around 10 years ago I tried multiple times to visit NEC but they always turned me down. Actually, there was one occasion when I went to a major Japanese manufacturer and stood at their front gates trying to hand out fliers that let people know all about Hightec Systems. Thanks to these efforts we are now trading with almost every Japanese manufacturer that is related to semiconductors and LCDs. It all started with distributing fliers.\n\nAs the audience for engineering services increased, sales grew to JPY 5 billion, and then we started receiving inquiries about purchasing whole factories. Usually, such inquiries go to the trading companies, but suddenly we started receiving such inquiries too. These larger orders started coming in around 2007-2008. If anything is left over by a factory then we disable that equipment and stock the parts. Additionally, if there is anything remaining after that then those parts are scrapped. The purpose of stocking parts is to have a good stock in our Kyushu center, and in our engineering business, we need the parts from old pieces of equipment. Customers will often ask for us to assist in relocating a factory that has older equipment, and that needs those older parts. This is even more true when a company approaches us to do a complete overhaul.\n\nThe parts center was opened in 2010 in the Kyushu area and was opened to support our engineering business. In fact, this parts center used to be a factory for NEC, and when NEC decided to shut down this facility we provided engineering services for this shutdown. Some of the factory lines were relocated to Akita, and this relocation was also run by our company. Engineers were made redundant, and we made sure to hire some of those engineers to work with us.\n\nDuring the course of time, word of mouth spread about Hightec Systems and how we hold various different types of parts. This became known and our reputation improved. Factories around Japan in different sectors need some parts for maintenance and when that happens they remember the name of Hightec Systems because of word of mouth.\n\nAt the very beginning, our parts center was for our engineering service and for lending parts to all of the factories that are in trouble or need maintenance. As our inventory of parts increased to over 300,000 in 2015 we started selling such parts. Even today we still rent parts to semiconductor manufacturers with long relationships.\n\nAs of 2015 I rarely visit out in the field or actual customer sites in person, and instead, I have my special engineers visit customers in person and help them through their issues. Relocation engineering doesn't just consist of moving equipment from one place to the other, because such equipment is often connected to a power source and wiring has to be safely removed. Additionally dangerous gas and electrical outlets need to be cut and the floor has to be reinforced. The company in fact has a certificate giving us permission for construction, and it relates to construction in large-scale projects. In a sense what we are doing for customers is like what a general contractor or a general construction company can do.\n\nEarlier I mentioned how in the year 2000 there were 40 traders of used semiconductor and FPD equipment, and as it stands today in 2022 only 20% have survived. I think this comes down to the risky nature of the business. Imagine a situation where an entire production line may cost up to JPY 1 billion, and if a trading company cannot find a buyer then that becomes a stranded asset. About 10-20 companies enter the market every year, but 10-20 companies exit during the same time frame.\n\nYou may ask yourself how we can survive this, and I think it comes down to the fact that we listen to our customers. If a customer needs parts for maintenance or to resolve an issue we might lend them for free. I think however that the biggest point is that we take care of both semiconductor manufacturing and FPD manufacturing equipment. There are so many semiconductor manufacturing equipment traders in the world but there are only a few FPD manufacturing equipment traders and we actually have a 90% market share in used equipment for FPD manufacturing. Almost all FPD factories use parts for their equipment provided by us. In fact, the same cycle applies to LCDs and the second-hand market too. They alternate so if our semiconductor equipment business is at a low point, we have alternatives that can complement a shortfall and vice versa.\n\nSince the COVID-19 pandemic started in 2020 we have seen some major disruptions, specifically in the semiconductor industry. Health measures and lockdowns led to logistics disruptions, that then led to supply chain issues, and now we have a worldwide chip shortage. As such we have seen an increase in the diversification of parts suppliers and also alternative markets such as the secondhand market grow. During the years of the COVID-19 pandemic, what opportunities or challenges emerged for Hightec Systems?\n\nOur sales hit the JPY 10 billion mark in 2014 and this year they are expected to hit JPY 25 billion. However despite this, in the years 2014-2022, there was no single year where we hit that JPY 10 billion mark. After 2014 sales were around JPY 9 billion a year, and in 2020 they fell to JPY 3 billion but have since rebounded.\n\nIn 2020 I held a town hall meeting with our employees and I warned them that because of the COVID-19 pandemic we cannot continue to visit customers in person, but since 2000 our company policy has been to visit and listen to customers in person. Of course, our activities have been restricted but we were sure that the electrical business will rebound back. Once it rebounded we had to collect all of the customers' orders without fail. I told employees that they should forget about sales targets for the time being and instead concentrate on addressing any needs that our clients may have at any cost.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier the semiconductor and FPD cycles alternate, and that has produced a very steady flow of income, and in 2015 we started learning mechatronics and the sales are stable and consistent in that business. Mechatronics is a multidisciplinary field that refers to the skill sets needed in the contemporary, advanced automated manufacturing industry. It now means that we have 3 different resources to generate a steady income. This advanced mechatronics business has added stability to our company as it deals with new products rather than second-hand equipment. As you can guess, the second-hand business has its ups and downs although it is stable.\n\nWith our second-hand equipment business, we have customer bases in universities and research institutes, particularly science and engineering universities. We have sold equipment such as microscopes all around the country. Corporate-affiliated research and development centers are also our customers because they usually have limited budgets to purchase measuring instruments. Therefore they are reliant on us to provide them with equipment.\n\nWith your business, there is this type of double sale happening because, first of all, you need to find a supply, negotiate and convince companies to give you their old equipment, and then ultimately you need to find a customer to sell that equipment to. Essentially you have a two-channel negotiation which is quite interesting. With this in mind are you looking to further expand your supply partners and therefore the products you offer to clients?\n\nIn our semiconductor and LCD business, a seller can become a buyer at any time and vice versa. As I mentioned earlier in 2002, I visited almost all the factories in Japan, so everyone knows us and it really is a circular model of business. We are a direct buyer from customers and then we are a direct seller to customers also. We don't need to expand our customer base because we are driven as a supply-based company.\n\nI would like to talk about how we started our advanced systems agency business. A local researcher knew about advanced systems that were only available outside of Japan, and that individual found that there wasn't any sales agent for those systems inside Japan. He wanted us to function as the sales agent for those advanced systems. Such information from customers is appreciated, but unfortunately, we cannot do everything, therefore it is important that we narrow down our focus. Once we made a decision, we began training our engineers in devices and equipment for process engineering. This means that our engineers can support the equipment purchased by Japanese customers.\n\nIn our clean room at our Fuji Factory, there are demo stations where our customers and engineers can identify and validate all process conditions. Once a customer is satisfied with the performance of a device, then a customer can then purchase and our engineers can do some calibration for them. So you can see that our agency business is not just moving new products, but also supportive services from our engineers too. To make that happen it was essential that we narrowed down our focus. Thanks to our activities in advanced systems as an agent we have not seen any sharp drops in sales when our second-hand equipment business was hit by the cycle.\n\nIt is widely known that American firms were the first to develop semiconductor equipment and then it later transferred to Japanese makers in the 1980s. If we look at the forefront these days it is a Dutch company; ASML, who are making extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) equipment and they are the only company in the world capable of producing these machines. In anticipation of this new technology, how would you go about getting your engineers up to speed with this cutting-edge tech that is exclusively coming from a European firm?\n\nWhat we do is purchase older equipment that is no longer cutting edge. Take for example a semiconductor stepper machine. A stepper is a tool device used in the manufacture of integrated circuits (ICs) that is similar in operation to a slide projector or a photographic enlarger. Stepper is short for the step-and-repeat camera. Steppers are an essential part of the complex process, called photolithography, which creates millions of microscopic circuit elements on the surface of silicon chips. We purchased 3 of these steppers, and we allowed our engineers to completely disassemble 1 of them so that they may study it and learn how it works from the inside out. You are right, that we need to keep up with the intricacies of new technology, however, new technology is not the key focus of our current business model. The new technology of today will be the old technology in 10 years time, so when we reach that point we will start learning the technology. It is our company's style to always go to the field and ask engineers what they want from us.\n\nThe essence of our corporate philosophy is that we serve our customers, and we are always striving to do whatever we can for those customers. Our business focus is Japanese companies, but of course, if a Japanese firm wants to relocate their equipment outside of Japan, we are happy to serve them. Vice Versa is also true, and we are more than happy to help a Japanese firm move their equipment from outside Japan back home to Japan, but I will stress that our focus is Japanese customers in Japan.\n\nYou may be asking yourself why our customers support us and how we have been able to increase our sales so rapidly, so I will talk a little about that now. People these days are saying that the semiconductor industry can make or break a country's economy and its competitiveness in the global market.\n\nSemiconductors and FPDs are considered high-tech products, but actually, they are part of the national strategy for national infrastructure. As a result, I'm sure that the semiconductor market will keep growing for sure. We see the market right now as at around JPY 50 trillion globally and the market revolving around cutting-edge mass production of 12-inch wafer fabrication, which is referred to as high-mix-low-volume. It extends from 2 inches all the way to 12 inches, but they say that there are over 650 fabrication plants producing smaller than 6 inches in operation worldwide. As you know there is a need to have the most advanced equipment to produce these discrete semiconductors and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). In other words, manufacturers are using 20-year-old equipment that requires frequent maintenance. Mass producers require different parts or different semiconductors, meaning this market is high-mix but that high-mix is replacing shorter time periods than before. In layman's terms that means that although Dyson for example might launch a new product that requires the latest semiconductors, producing such semiconductors doesn't require the most advanced equipment, and can be produced by equipment that is 20 years old, or perhaps even older. To deal with this situation the 650 fabrication plants around the world need to fine-tune or calibrate their equipment to catch up with the demand. This high-mix-low-volume market these days equates to around JPY 25 trillion. In this used equipment market the maintenance and the prolonging of the equipment's life is key, so that really makes up the focus of our business.\n\nIn the past, the main focus and application of semiconductors were for PCs, but now we see that it has shifted to mobile devices. The next frontier for semiconductors will be electric vehicles and drones. Once Japanese companies take that seriously I think that Japanese firms will once again reign supreme in the markets of semiconductors. The same description applies to FPD, and once the years go on, that is when we can become active in refurbishing older technologies for needed applications.\n\nYou've explained how at the beginning your firm began as a brokerage firm between Taiwanese and Korean semiconductor makers and you've had a base there for years now. Looking at the future, are you looking to further expand your business internationally? If so, which countries or regions will be key to your expansion?\n\nMy business focus is Japanese companies and the Japanese market, particularly long-tail semiconductor products and that focus has remained unchanged since the foundation of the company. Of course, yes we need to consider overseas markets, and geography wise China, South Korea, and Taiwan are very close and that means that it is easier for us to set up bases in those countries. We believe however that we need to enter the US market and of course, the United States is across the Pacific Ocean and therefore not easy to travel to. There are more than 650 fabrication plants in Europe and the United States, and the United States is focusing on local production of semiconductors due to President Biden's CHIPS act. That said, there are a lot of American companies that are engaged in this long-tail market, and this is the kind of market we can survive in.\n\nOnce we enter the US market we can use it as a foothold to expand our business further abroad to Europe. In that sense, entering the US market is a strategic move of great importance. The market research is underway and we have recently closed a contract with a consultancy firm based in California. We also participated in SEMICON West this year jointly with that consultant. Not only are there cultural differences between the US and Japan, but also corporate differences which I think are huge. In fact, I personally feel that my company is more Japanese than most Japanese firms; perhaps you could say that we are the most Japanese company in Japan.\n\nSo far in our market research, we have found multiple US-based equipment traders that are both ambitious and competitive. It will be far from easy to compete with such rivals. The plan is rather than compete with such rivals, perhaps instead we can work collaboratively together in order to bridge the gap between the US and Japanese markets.\n\nYour company celebrated its 30th anniversary just last year, so I would like you to imagine that we come back again to interview you in 20 years' time. Is there a personal goal or ambition that you would like to have achieved by then?\n\nLooking back at the past 30 years I think my company has been very successful because the number of employees has increased from just 3, all the way to 100. Despite this, however, this is not the measure of my own personal success. I would like to make our company a really Japanese company, which is ironic considering that this company's mission is to sell electronics which is essentially a global market. The industry we are in is considered high-tech compared to other manufacturing industries, but even still I find the monozukuri spirit lives on in the factories of electronic products. The reason that monozukuri is so strong and world-renowned is that in essence, it is a spirit that brings people together to address something. This strength works very well for Japanese companies, especially in particularly troubling times.\n\nIn March last year, a major Japanese semiconductor manufacturer had a fire at one of its factories and had to suspend its operations. At that time our company dispatched 150 engineers. Actually, the factory ended up burning down, but in 2 and a half months the factory was able to restore operations because 33,000 engineers from across different sectors of business gathered there to work on the restoration of the factory. That was only possible because it happened in Japan. In fact, we received a nice letter of appreciation from the company for our work on restoration.\n\nIn Western countries, innovation is started by a very small number of the most elite in society and they use people who are below them, but in Japan innovation has come about thanks to collective efforts in a bottom-up approach. Up until the 1980s Japan was seen as a threat to Western innovation because the US could not understand Japan's approach. Such practices or behavioral patterns are a combination of Japanese culture, education, and family values.\n\nThis unfortunately was followed by the lost decades and Japanese corporate managers tried to adopt Western styles, which is to rely on a few elites to manage the entire system. In my view, this was a big change in society. Despite the longstanding value and culture of Japan, these companies have tried to adopt a Western style and in my opinion, it really doesn't work. This is why there isn't the next mega-corporation like Google or Apple coming from Japan. For this reason, I've bought back all the shares in the company, so right now there are only two shareholders; myself and another executive, and we have no plans or intentions of an IPO. In this kind of environment, I would like to continue to pursue the Japanese style of management for this company. My focus is on my employees and their families so that they can start innovation from within, and our corporate philosophy supports that.",

Everett Dirksen is credited with the famous phrase \"a billion here, a billion there, and pretty soon you're talking real money.\"\n\nThe senator from Illinois, who died in 1969, was supposedly complaining about excessive federal spending, and while some dispute that he actually said those words, the line has found a place in history.\n\nRelated: Analyst updates SoFi stock outlook after earnings\n\nMichael Saylor also knows a thing or two about real money.\n\nThe co-founder and executive chairman of MicroStrategy (MSTR) once lost $6 billion in a single day back in 2020, after the business-intelligence company announced accounting mistakes and the stock dropped.\n\nSaylor, who stepped down as MicroStrategy's CEO in 2022, reached a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission that included an $8.3 million personal disgorgement.\n\nHe has also been a bitcoin evangelist, and he spoke about the primary digital currency during MicroStrategy's first-quarter-earnings call.\n\n\"This quarter,\" he said, \"it's the end of the crypto childhood or the crypto cowboy era, where you had had 15 years of lots of confusion, chaos, and jockeying of thousands and thousands of crypto assets.\"\n\n\"Well, bitcoin is the winner, and it is the one emergent institutional asset that has come out of that 15 years,\" Saylor said.\n\nMicroStrategy's co-founder calls bitcoin 'unique'\n\nInvestors' interest in bitcoin soared with January's introduction of bitcoin exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, particularly the ones offered by BlackRock and Fidelity Investments.\n\n\"And so, bitcoin is very unique,\" Saylor said. \"It's the one crypto asset that a publicly traded company can hold on its balance sheet, can capitalize upon.\"\n\nRelated: Analyst revamps Apple stock rating ahead of key earnings report\n\nSaylor maintained that entire modern institutional asset economy, the options market, the securities market, the money manager system, the institutional mutual funds, the institutional ETFs, are all going to be centered around bitcoin as the digital property going forward.\n\n\"And so, while we're at the end of the beginning, you know, we're now, I would say, at the beginning of the middle,\" he said.\n\nMicroStrategy posted a first-quarter loss of $3.09 per share on April 29, swinging from earnings of $31.79 a year earlier and missing the FactSet analyst consensus calling for a loss of 55 cents a share.\n\nThe latest result reflected a $192 million bitcoin impairment charge, \"the result of bitcoin price fluctuations throughout this past quarter,\" the company said. The charge in the year-earlier period was $20 million.\n\nRevenue totaled $115 million, down from $126 million a year earlier and short of FactSet's call for $121.7 million.\n\nBitcoin was down 3% to $60,864 at last check, while MicroStrategy was tumbling 15.5% to $1,092. The company's executives still pledged their allegiance to crypto.\n\nAndrew Kang, MicroStrategy's chief financial officer, said the company was the world's largest corporate holder of bitcoin, \"and we remain committed to our bitcoin acquisition strategy with the utmost conviction, long-term focus, and with a strong risk-managed approach.\"\n\nCEO: 'we're highly committed to bitcoin strategy'\n\nPresident and CEO Phong Le told analysts \"we remain highly committed to our bitcoin strategy with a long-term focus.\"\n\n\"This past quarter, the price of bitcoin appreciated significantly, spurred notably by the approval of the spot bitcoin exchange-traded products or ETPs, which has drawn considerable institutional attention,\" he said.\n\nMore Tech Stocks:\n\nCathie Wood buys $22 million of battered tech stockAnalyst revamps Nvidia price target as Mag 7 earnings loomAnalyst unveils new Amazon price target as stock tests $2 trillion\n\nHe said the company believed that the introduction of spot bitcoin ETPs \"further evidences the maturation of bitcoin as an institutional grade asset class with broader regulatory recognition and institutional adoption.\"\n\nCanaccord lowered its price target on MicroStrategy to $1,590 from $1,810 while affirming a buy rating on the shares.\n\nThe investment firm said the company's strategy was again in full swing in the first quarter, given the approvals of U.S.-listed spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nMicroStrategy raised more than $1.5 billion in the first quarter and used the proceeds to acquire an additional 25,250 bitcoin. It now owns 214,400 BTC valued around $13.6 billion, Canaccord told investors in a research report.\n\nBitcoin recently marked its fourth halving, where the reward for mining the crypto is split in half. Halvings reduce the rate at which new coins are created, lowering the available amount of new supply.\n\nCanaccord said that with the recent halving event, the amount of new bitcoin mined per day has been reduced by 50%.\n\nRelated: Veteran fund manager picks favorite stocks for 2024",

None of them deserved it,\" the 35-year-old said.\n\n\"They were actually going through problems for real and then you've got Belle who's faking cancer and pretending to fix herself and play doctor herself and all this other rubbish. The people she was scamming actually had cancer.\"\n\nMr Gibson, who lives in Brisbane with his family, said he believes his sister belongs behind bars.\n\n\"The things she's done to those families, well, technically it's fraud,\" he said.\n\n\"I think she should be locked up, spend some time in prison and have a bit of a think about it because I don't think she realises what she's done to them.\n\n\"I shouldn't be saying this because I'm her brother, but what she did was nasty. Some prison time would give her a wake-up call.\"\n\nThat Ms Gibson was only fined for her actions, Mr Gibson added, is \"a slap on the wrist\".\n\n\"If we got a fine and we didn't pay for it in a certain time, we'd probably get locked up. People are angry, I've seen death threats on Facebook directed at her,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm always going to have a bit of love there for my sister. I just hope she gets some help for herself.\"\n\nMs Gibson's story has been the subject of a recent two-part documentary, Instagram's Worst Con Artist, on Britain's ITV, has also inspired an upcoming Netflix drama, Apple Cider Vinegar.\n\nSpeaking to The Sun ahead of the ITV documentary's premiere last week, Chantelle McAuliffe shared the moment she realised her former best friend was lying about being terminally-ill.\n\nThe \"red flags really started to pop up for me\", Ms McAuliffe said, when she watched Ms Gibson miraculously recover from what seemed to be a seizure - wiping the saliva from her mouth and insisting she was fine, after moments before rolling around on the floor.\n\n\"I felt really sick in my stomach for what I had just seen,\" she said.\n\nDays later, when Ms McAuliffe found out via an Instagram post that Ms Gibson's cancer had allegedly spread, \"I started to question everything, to go over it all in my mind\".\n\n\"She always looked so well, she never looked sick. I started to think about times where she had gone on tanning beds and another time when we went to a nightclub and she was ordering shots and drinks,\" Ms McAuliffe recalled.\n\n\"I said to Belle, 'This is not good'. But she said, 'I'm going to die soon anyway. Why not have some fun?'\n\n\"Those weren't things she was sharing with her online community. Things just didn't add up for me.\"",

According to The Hollywood Reporter, the film, which is set to star Paul Walter Hauser as the late Farley, has been picked up by New Line following what was described as a \"highly competitive situation\". Gad is set to direct the film.\n\nThe biopic is to be based on New York Times best-selling biography, The Chris Farley Show: A Biography in Three Acts written by Farley's brother Tom Farley Jr. and Tanner Colby. Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber will adapt the book for screen and the project is said to have the Farley family's blessing. Saturday Night Live creator Lorne Michaels and Erin David are serving as producers for Broadway Video on the film.\n\nThe film will tell Farley's story as one of the greatest comic actors of his generation. Farley notably grew to prominence on Saturday Night Live, which he joined in 1990, as part of an ensemble that include greats such as Adam Sandler, David Spade, Phil Hartman, and Rob Schneider, with Farley quickly becoming a standout with iconic sketches including \"Van Down By the River\" and characters such as the motivational speaker Matt Foley. Farley's star continued to rise on the big screen as well, with hit films such as Tommy Boy in 1995 and Black Sheep in 1996. Sadly, Farley died of a drug overdose in 1997 at the age of 33.\n\nHauser is best known for his role in Black Bird, for which he won a Golden Globe Award. He will also next appear in Disney and Pixar's Inside Out 2, where he voices Embarrassment and is also set to appear in Apple's The Instigators as well as Americana, opposite Sydney Sweeney. He has also starred in films such as Richard Jewell, I, Tonya, and Cruella, as well as the television series Cobra Kai. Hauser has previously spoken about wanting to play Farley and bring his story to screen, even telling The Hollywood Reporter back in 2021 that he had approached the Farley family about a potential project.\n\nFor Gad, his work includes Disney's Frozen, Beauty and the Beast and Murder on the Orient Express, as well as various Broadway musicals, including Book of Mormon and Gutenberg! The Chris Farley biopic will mark his directorial debut.",

He was traveling alone, and neither speeding nor intoxication are suspected to be factors in the wreck.\n\nAt about 7:45 that night, an SUV hit a Canadian man on a bicycle south of Helena, killing him. The 36-year-old bicyclist from Alberta was apparently riding south in the northbound lane of Montana Highway 282. He was trying to cross over into the southbound lane when a northbound SUV struck him, according to MHP. The driver of the SUV, a woman from Pray, was not hurt in the crash, but alcohol and speeding are suspected to be factors.\n\nFinally, a Hysham man died later that same night after his pickup truck went off the road near his hometown. The 67-year-old was driving alone west on Bear Creek Road. When he reached the intersection of Sarpy Road south of Hysham, per MHP, the truck went off the road and struck a tree. First responders pronounced the man dead at the scene. Speeding and intoxication are not suspected to be factors in the crash.\n\nThe four wrecks remain under investigation by MHP. As of April 29, at least 49 people have died on Montana's roads so far this year, more than the 38 fatalities around this same time in 2023. Intoxication has been a factor in just over half of the deadly crashes this year.\n\nMemorial Day next month will mark the start of what public safety agencies refer to as the \"100 Deadliest Days,\" which runs through Labor Day. During those roughly three months, serious and fatal crashes spike nationwide with the warmer weather and summer travelers.\n\nIn Montana, last year ended with a drop in fatalities but an uptick in deadly wrecks. While intoxication has consistently been a leading factor in Montana's fatalities, last year saw an increase in speeding contributing to death's on the state's roads.\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Transportation Motor Vehicles Roads And Traffic The Economy Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.

        "text": "In January, thousands braved the freezing cold at Delhi's Red Fort to hear Prime Minister Narendra Modi speak.\n\nHis message was \"Viksit Bharat 2047\", a promise to make India a developed nation by 2047.\n\nIt's the latest catchphrase from a man known for his penchant for catchy taglines.\n\n\"Developed India\" is an imprecise pledge, but in the 10 years since Mr Modi first stormed to power, he has been trying to lay the foundations for a period of economic boom.\n\nThe prime minister and his government inherited an economy that was teetering on the precipice. Growth was slowing and investor confidence was low. A dozen Indian billionaires had gone bankrupt, saddling the country's banks with enormous unpaid loans that had crippled their capacity to lend.\n\nNow, 10 years on, India's growth is outpacing other major economies, its banks are strong, and the government's finances are stable despite a painful pandemic. India surpassed the UK as the fifth largest economy last year and according to analysts at Morgan Stanley, it's on track to overtake Japan and Germany and hit the third spot by 2027.\n\nThere is undoubtedly an air of optimism in the country. It successfully hosted the G20, became the first to send a rocket near the Moon's south pole, and has birthed a few dozen unicorns. The soaring stock markets have also had a trickle-down effect on the wealth of its middle class.\n\nOn the face of it \"Modinomics\" - the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)'s economic vision for India - appears to be working. But dig deeper, and the picture is more complex. For a vast swathe of the country's 1.4 billion people who live on the margins of sustenance, it's not boomtime just as yet.\n\nMr Modi's push for digital governance has begun to transform the lives of some of the country's poorest people.\n\nToday, Indians in the remotest corners of the country can buy many daily goods without cash, paying as little as 20p for a packet of bread using a QR code on their phone.\n\nUnderpinning this digital revolution is a three-layer system of governance, which includes universal identity cards, a payments infrastructure that enables click-of-a-button money transfer, and a data pillar that gives people access to crucial personal documents like tax returns.\n\nLinking hundreds of millions of bank accounts to this \"digital stack\" has cut red tape and corruption.\n\nEstimates suggest that up to March 2021, an equivalent of about 1.1% of GDP was saved due to digital governance, allowing the government to dole out a volley of social subsidies, cash handouts and also spend on infrastructure building, without running high deficits.\n\nCranes, cranes everywhere!\n\nEverywhere you go in India there are cranes and JCB machines at work giving its creaky public infrastructure a shiny makeover.\n\nTake a look at this slick first underwater metro in the eastern Indian city of Kolkata.\n\nThere's no doubt this country is getting a facelift.\n\nBuilding new roads, airports, ports and metros has been the centrepiece of Mr Modi's economic policy. He spent over $100bn annually in infrastructure spending (capital expenditure) in the past three years.\n\nNearly 54,000 km (33,554 miles) of national highways were built between 2014 and 2024 - which is twice the length of the preceding 10 years.\n\nThe government has also considerably eased up the bureaucracy, which has been a major bugbear of India's economy for decades.\n\nBut Mr Modi's policies haven't delivered for all.\n\nThe brutal lockdowns imposed during the pandemic, the lingering after-effects of a cash ban in 2016, and faulty implementation of a new goods and services tax - a long pending reform meant to streamline the country's welter of indirect taxes - have had far-reaching structural consequences on India's economy.\n\nThe country's vast unorganised sector - small enterprises that form the backbone of this country - are still reeling under the impact of some of these decisions.\n\nAnd the private sector is not committing big investments. As a proportion of GDP, private investments slumped to barely 19.6% in 2020-21 from a peak of 27.5% in 2007-08.\n\nJobs blues\n\nIn January, thousands gathered outside government recruitment centres in the northern city of Lucknow to go to Israel for jobs in the construction industry. My colleague Archana Shukla was on location.\n\nThe desperation of these workers showed India's jobs crisis is real. And it is crushing aspirations everywhere.\n\n\"I'm the first master's degree holder in my family,\" says Rukaiya Bepari, a 23-year-old graduate in the town of Miraj in western India.\n\n\"But there's no industry where I live. So I'm now taking tuitions. It doesn't pay much.\"\n\nNeither Rukaiya nor her brother have had full-time work for the last two years. They're not alone.\n\nUnemployment among educated youth has doubled from 35.2% to 65.7% between 2000 and 2022, according to latest figures by the Indian Labour Organization, a human rights group.\n\nThere's also been no significant growth of real wages in India since 2014, according to numbers computed by noted developmental economist Jean Dreze.\n\nIndia \"risks squandering its demographic dividend\" - the economic growth potential from a big working-age population - the World Bank's regional economist said in an interview to the Financial Times recently.\n\nJob creation is a problem Mr Modi has been unable to solve.\n\nRight off the back of his victory in 2014, the prime minister launched an ambitious Make In India campaign to turn India into the world's factory. In 2020, his government doled out $25bn in incentives to companies across sectors from semi-conductors to mobile electronics in order to enhance India's manufacturing capabilities.\n\nBut success has been elusive.\n\nYes, the likes of Foxconn - which makes iPhones for Apple - are moving their supply chains to India as part of the global \"China plus one\" diversification strategy. Other major global giants like Micron and Samsung have also been enthused to invest. But the numbers are not significant yet.\n\nManufacturing's share as a percentage of GDP has remained stagnant in the last decade despite these efforts.\n\nGrowth in exports was also faster under Mr Modi's predecessors.\n\n\"Even if India's manufacturing grows 8% per year till 2050 and China's stagnates at the 2022 level, India's manufacturing size in 2050 will still not match that of China's in 2022,\" says Prof Vidya Mahambare of the Great Lakes Institute of Management.\n\nLack of a large scale industry means half of India's population still depends on agriculture for their livelihoods - which is increasingly becoming unprofitable.\n\nTwo speed recovery\n\nA direct impact of this? Squeezed household budgets.\n\nAt 3%, the growth in overall private consumption expenditure - the money people spend on buying things - is the slowest in 20 years.\n\nAnd household debt has touched an all-time high, even as financial savings plunged to their lowest levels, according to new research.\n\nMany economists argue that the nature of India's economic growth post pandemic has been uneven, or \"K-shaped\" - where the rich have thrived, while the poor continue to struggle. India may be the fifth largest global economy at an aggregate level, but on a per person basis, it still languishes at the 140th rank.\n\nAnd inequality has widened to a hundred-year high according to research from the World Inequality Database. No surprises then that election campaign discourse recently has been rife with chatter around wealth redistribution and inheritance taxes.\n\nA three day pre-wedding ceremony of Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani's son recently offered a glimpse into the country's new gilded age. Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates and Ivanka Trump were in attendance. Rihanna shook a leg with Bollywood's biggest celebrities, while the Ambani women flashed diamonds and jewellery once part of the Mughal empire's collection.\n\nLuxury brands making cars, watches and liquor have been growing faster than India's more mass-market companies, according to Arnab Mitra, who researches Indian consumer brands at Goldman Sachs.\n\nViral Acharya, a professor at NYU Stern, says a handful of the biggest conglomerates have grown \"at the expense of the smallest firms\".\n\nThe super-rich, he says, have benefited from sharp tax cuts and a conscious policy of creating \"national champions\" in which prized public assets like ports and airports have been preferentially given to a few companies to build or run.\n\nLatest court revelations show many of them have also been India's top political donors to the ruling BJP.\n\nIndia's decade?\n\nAll combined, this presents an inconsistent picture of India's economy. But for all its problems, the country is on the runway for take-off, say experts.\n\n\"India's next decade could resemble China's path (of hyper growth) from 2007 through 2012,\" analysts from Morgan Stanley wrote in a widely discussed paper.\n\nThey add that the country has many advantages - a young demographic, the geopolitics of global de-risking from China and a clean-up of sectors like real estate. Other megatrends like digitalisation, a transition to clean energy and growth in global offshoring will propel future growth, say experts.\n\nThe infra push is also something that will have long-term payoffs. By making improvements in roads, power supply and turnaround time at ports - India is finally \"creating an environment in which manufacturing can flourish\", says DK Joshi, CRISIL's India economist.\n\nBut along with the focus on \"physical capital\", Mr Modi needs to pay heed to creating \"human capital\", says Dr Raghuram Rajan, the former governor of India's central bank.\n\nIndian children aren't learning as well as they should to face up to the world of artificial intelligence. A quarter of those aged 14 to 18 can't read simple text fluently, according to a report published by the non-profit Pratham Foundation.\n\nCovid-19 dealt a major blow to students, who couldn't attend school for nearly two years. But the government has continued to underfund education, and healthcare.\n\nIn its first decade, Modinomics appears to have delivered for a select few. But for many the jar, as it appears, is still half empty.\n\n\"We will grow old before we grow rich\" if growth isn't faster and more equitable, says Dr Rajan.",

        "text": "Zhao has an estimated personal net worth of $33 billion, according to Forbes' World's Billionaires list.\n\nChangpeng Zhao, the billionaire co-founder and former CEO of Binance, is expected to see his mammoth wealth remain intact and likely continue to climb even as he faces time behind bars after his sentencing in a Seattle court.\n\nZhao, who is commonly referred to as \"CZ\" in crypto circles, was sentenced to four months in prison on Tuesday, after pleading guilty to charges of enabling money laundering at his crypto exchange.\n\nThe sentence handed down to Zhao in Seattle federal court was significantly less than the three years that federal prosecutors had been seeking for him. The defense had asked for five months of probation. Sentencing guidelines called for a prison term of 12 to 18 months.\n\nA Binance spokesperson said in a statement to CNBC the crypto exchange has made \"considerable compliance enhancements,\" including with regards to anti-money laundering detection and \"hiring key compliance personnel.\"\n\nA lawyer for Zhao did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.\n\nIn November, Zhao struck a deal with the U.S. government to resolve a multiyear investigation into Binance. As part of Binance's $4.3 billion settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice, Zhao stepped down as the company's CEO, and the exchange agreed to form a board of directors with independent members, as well as compliance and audit committees.\n\nOf the seven total directors recently named to the since-formed board of directors, three were designated as being \"independent\" -- and five of them, including all of the board's independent members, submitted letters to the judge in Zhao's criminal case asking for leniency in sentencing.\n\nGabriel Abed, the board's chairman and one of its independent members, told U.S. District Judge Richard Jones that Zhao was \"distinguished by a stoic composure and genuine humility\" and that \"despite his significant achievements,\" he maintained a lifestyle marked by simplicity including dressing in clothes bought on Amazon, driving a Toyota and wearing an Apple watch.\n\nDespite Zhao now facing time in prison, industry experts and lawyers who spoke with CNBC say his tremendous personal wealth will remain unaffected and, if anything, is likely to rise.\n\nLos Angeles corporate law attorney Tre Lovell tells CNBC that the government is only entitled to any restitution or fines imposed and not to Zhao's assets or wealth as a whole. Former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani agrees, adding that Zhao's personal wealth won't be affected by his sentence.\n\n\"Because Zhao and the government came to an agreement, the government didn't get a judgment or restitution order against Zhao and do discovery into his assets,\" said Rahmani. \"He'll have significant wealth when he is released from prison.\"\n\nZhao took Binance, the cryptocurrency exchange he co-founded in 2017, from a relatively obscure company to one of the most formidable players in the booming digital currency space.\n\nDespite the fact that Zhao is being put behind bars, his controlling stake in Binance means that he will continue being one of the wealthiest people in crypto today.\n\nNotably, because Zhao pleaded guilty to only one count of violation of the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), he is regarded as a first-time offender, and thus reached a settlement with federal authorities to step down as CEO and not relinquish his interest in the company or have assets frozen.\n\n\"Typically, personal assets that are not directly linked to the criminal activity might remain unaffected,\" said Braden Perry, a former senior trial lawyer for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. \"His assets could also be managed on his behalf while he is incarcerated.\"\n\nThat's a different siutation from Sam Bankman-Fried, the controversial ex-CEO and founder of crypto exchange FTX. Bankman-Fried, who's commonly referred to as \"SBF,\" saw his wealth reduced to zero after his crypto empire collapsed into bankruptcy in 2022.\n\n\"In relation to CZ's personal wealth ... he would still be able to retain his share in Binance, as well as maintain his crypto holdings which also contribute an unknown, yet material, amount to his overall wealth and net worth,\" Joshua de Vos, research lead at CCData, told CNBC via email.\n\n\"Since there is no misappropriation or bankruptcy proceedings, it is highly unlikely that CZ would see his wealth reduced to zero as was the case with SBF,\" de Vos said.\n\nWhat's more, Zhao has gotten off much easier in sentencing than former crypto rival Bankman-Fried. Bankman-Fried received a 25-year prison term for crimes connected to the operation of his crypto exchange.\n\nUnlike Zhao and the charges brought against Binance, Bankman-Fried's bankrupt exchange faced allegations of fraud and misuse of customers' funds.\n\nExperts say that Zhao's net worth is likely to continue rising as buoyant crypto prices, which tend to support trading activity on Binance, boost his own personal fortune.\n\n\"CZ will now be one of the wealthiest people in prison,\" said Yesha Yadav, law professor and associate dean at Vanderbilt University.\n\nThat's even after a litany of legal troubles, including the Department of Justice's case against it, and several other high-profile lawsuits -- including one from the Securities and Exchange Commission which remains ongoing.\n\nThe SEC has accused Binance of making multiple unregistered offers and sales of crypto asset securities. It is not yet clear when that case will reach a conclusion.\n\nZhao had an estimated personal net worth of $33 billion on March 8, 2024, up from $10.5 billion the same time last year, according to Forbes' World's Billionaires list, which ranks the richest peopole using stock prices and exchange rates.\n\nBloomberg's Billionaires Index, a separate measure of the world's wealthiest, pegs Zhao's net worth at an even higher sum, $42.9 billion.\n\nCNBC was unable to independently verify Zhao's overall net worth.\n\nBut Zhao is widely reported to have an estimated 90% stake in Binance, and his fortune is largely derived from his equity ownership in the company.\n\nBinance is by far the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, processing $18.1 trillion worth of trading volume in 2023, according to data from crypto market data firm CCData.\n\nAround 80% -- or $14.4 trillion -- of that came from derivatives products like futures contracts, while the remaining $3.7 trillion came from spot trading. Derivatives trading is a key part of Binance's business.\n\nAnd even though Binance has seen its market share drop to 41.6% since Zhao stepped down as CEO in November 2023, the company remains the dominant player overall -- leagues ahead of South Korean exchange Upbit, Dubai-headquartered Bybit, and U.S. giant Coinbase.\n\nZhao has said previously he has personal investments in bitcoin and Binance's own BNB token, however he's not disclosed the value of those holdings. Binance Coin, or BNB, is up 83% so far this year to $576.\n\nLucas Kiely, chief investment officer of digital wealth platform Yield App, said that Zhao's \"significant stake in the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume positions him to potentially benefit from the overall growth of the crypto market.\"\n\nThe recent approval of a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund in the U.S. has led to renewed interest in the crypto market, and helped trigger a wave of fresh institutional investment, according to Kiely -- and that's sure to be a boon to Binance.\n\n\"Such developments could contribute to the growth of Binance and, by extension, CZ's wealth,\" he told CNBC.\n\nZhao has been hit with a partial knock to his overall fortune -- he was forced to pay a $50 million fine, in addition to the $4.3 billion in fines and forfeiture Binance was ordered to pay for violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act and sanctions on Iran. Yadav noted that it's also possible Zhao makes some contribution to the billions Binance owes to the government.\n\nYadav tells CNBC that even though CZ's vast wealth is not directly under threat by virtue of his conviction and the sentencing today, there may still be some indirect effects.\n\n\"Negative long-term impact on Binance will diminish the value of CZ's investment in the crypto exchange,\" said Yadav. \"Conversely, however, CZ may even benefit if Binance begins a path to recovery following today's sentencing, the plea deal and monitorship arrangement, and regains its market share over time as a result.\"",

        "text": "About halfway through his first set at Auckland's packed-out Spark Arena, legendary American singer-songwriter James Taylor takes off his jacket and settles back onto his stool.\n\n\"That was exciting,\" he responds to the audience applause. \"Later I might take out my teeth.\"\n\nGrandad is holding court and it feels reassuring.\n\nTaylor, 76, has been part of the popular music tapestry since the late 1960s, when he first performed in front of Beatles Paul McCartney and George Harrison, auditioning to join their new Apple recording label.\n\n\"I just heard his voice and his guitar, and I thought he was great,\" recalled McCartney in Taylor's biography Long Ago and Far Away. \"And then he came and played live, so it was just, like, 'Wow, he's great'.\"\n\nTaylor still remembers that day and the song he played - 'Something In the Way She Moves' - is, fittingly, the opening number on his Asian and Pacific concert tour.\n\n\"You think I was nervous playing it for you,\" he admits. \"Imagine how nervous I was then.\"\n\nTaylor sits on stage under a spotlight, no frills. No light show, no fireworks, no big screens... just one man, his guitar and a collection of songs honed lovingly over more than half a century.\n\nAnd a smattering of grandad jokes.\n\n\"A dyslexic walks into a bra,\" he offers, amid groans.\n\nTaylor would become the first non-British act signed to Apple and a close collaborator with the 'Fab Four'. Harrison would write his own version of Taylor's audition piece, he and McCartney would guard on 'Carolina in My Mind'.\n\nYears later, as John Lennon's neighbour, Taylor had his own scary encounter with Lennon's assassin, Mark Chapman. Next day, he heard the fateful shots next door.\n\nFor the uninitiated, Taylor's first set at Spark can be hard going. Of the 10 songs, probably only Del Shannon cover 'Handy Man' was among his top charting singles - his highest charter in NZ - but every one of them seemed to have a story.\n\n'That's Why I'm Here' alludes to the death of actor and friend John Belushi (Saturday Night Live, Blues Brothers, Animal House) of a drug overdose, a tragedy that helped Taylor turn around his own struggles with addiction.\n\n'Sweet Baby James' is a lullaby for a nephew named after him.\n\nWhile the recognition of those songs may be missing, the focus is squarely on Taylor performing his craft with a voice that could make a squeaky door hinge sound beautiful, while building his rapport with an appreciative audience.\n\nWith no support act, the night is entirely about him, but Gramps has the good grace to provide a 20-minute intermission for everyone to stretch their legs and regroup.\n\n\"I don't know why,\" he admits. \"We just stand on the other side of the curtain, looking at our watches.\"\n\nIf the first hour never quite gets out of second gear, Taylor doesn't disappoint on the resumption, as he climbs into his big hits, beginning with 'Carolina in My Mind'. He even breaks out an electric guitar for 'Mexico'.\n\n\"When we played in Pennsylvania, the Amish community there still use horse-draw guitars.\"\n\n'Steamroller' is a favourite and unashamedly bluesy, offering Taylor's All-Star Band a chance to show their chops with a series of solos, beginning with Taylor himself on the harmonica. Each musician or vocalist is introduced reverently with a respectful handshake or a warm hug.\n\nThe haunting 'Fire and Rain' is another reflection of his drug woes and the suicide of friend Suzanne Schnerr.\n\nMany of Taylor's best-loved songs are actually covers that have become more recognised than the originals over the years. 'Up on the Roof' was written by Carole King for The Drifters, while 'You Got a Friend' was another King composition.\n\n'How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved by You)' was originally recorded by Marvin Gaye, but was outcharted by Taylor's version a decade later. This is the last number of his second set at Spark Arena and finally gets the fans out of their seats.\n\nCalled back for an encore, Taylor performs 'Shed a Little Light' and 'Smiling Face', before holding up his finger for just one more, 'You Can Close Your Eyes'.\n\n\"Did that look spontaneous?\" he quips. \"We've been practicing our spontaneity.\"\n\nFinally, it's time to climb down off grandad's knee, suitably enriched by his wisdom, his sincerity, his wry humour and his humility.\n\nWe can all use a dose of those wholesome traits in our lives.",

        "text": "Four Montanans and a Canadian died in four crashes over the weekend, most of the crashes on rural roads in the central part of the state.\n\nIntoxication and speeding were suspected in half of the fatal wrecks, according to preliminary investigation reports from Montana Highway Patrol, all which occurred on April 27. As of late April 2024, deadly crashes are ahead of those at this same time last year.\n\nMHP responded to the first fatal crash at around 6:20 p.m. on April 27. Two men were traveling in a pickup truck south along Clarkston Road, which runs next to the Missouri River as it flows from its headwaters toward Townsend. A few miles south of Clarkston, the pickup truck drifted off the east side of the road, colliding with a tree.\n\nThe truck caught fire after the impact. Emergency crews pronounced the driver, a 27-year-old Townsend man, and the 38-year-old passenger from Belgrade, dead at the scene. The road was wet at the time of the crash, according to MHP. Speeding and drunk driving were also suspected to be factors.\n\nPeople are also reading...

A 26-year-old Greycliff man was at the wheel of a pickup truck traveling westbound on Greycliff Road. Near Greycliff Creek, according to MHP, he was rounding a turn and briefly went off the left side of the road. The driver overcorrected, bringing the truck back onto the road but off the opposite side, taking the truck into a field. The truck overturned several times, ejecting the driver.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nAmbulance crews brought the driver to a Billings hospital, where he died. He was traveling alone, and neither speeding nor intoxication are suspected to be factors in the wreck.\n\nAt about 7:45 that night, an SUV hit a Canadian man on a bicycle south of Helena, killing him. The 36-year-old bicyclist from Alberta was apparently riding south in the northbound lane of Montana Highway 282. He was trying to cross over into the southbound lane when a northbound SUV struck him, according to MHP. The driver of the SUV, a woman from Pray, was not hurt in the crash, but alcohol and speeding are suspected to be factors.\n\nFinally, a Hysham man died later that same night after his pickup truck went off the road near his hometown. The 67-year-old was driving alone west on Bear Creek Road. When he reached the intersection of Sarpy Road south of Hysham, per MHP, the truck went off the road and struck a tree. First responders pronounced the man dead at the scene. Speeding and intoxication are not suspected to be factors in the crash.\n\nThe four wrecks remain under investigation by MHP. As of April 29, at least 49 people have died on Montana's roads so far this year, more than the 38 fatalities around this same time in 2023. Intoxication has been a factor in just over half of the deadly crashes this year.\n\nMemorial Day next month will mark the start of what public safety agencies refer to as the \"100 Deadliest Days,\" which runs through Labor Day. During those roughly three months, serious and fatal crashes spike nationwide with the warmer weather and summer travelers.\n\nIn Montana, last year ended with a drop in fatalities but an uptick in deadly wrecks. While intoxication has consistently been a leading factor in Montana's fatalities, last year saw an increase in speeding contributing to death's on the state's roads.\n\n0 Comments You must be logged in to react.\n\nClick any reaction to login.

Former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani agrees, adding that Zhao's personal wealth won't be affected by his sentence.\n\n\"Because Zhao and the government came to an agreement, the government didn't get a judgment or restitution order against Zhao and do discovery into his assets,\" said Rahmani. \"He'll have significant wealth when he is released from prison.\"\n\nZhao took Binance, the cryptocurrency exchange he co-founded in 2017, from a relatively obscure company to one of the most formidable players in the booming digital currency space.\n\nDespite the fact that Zhao is being put behind bars, his controlling stake in Binance means that he will continue being one of the wealthiest people in crypto today.\n\nNotably, because Zhao pleaded guilty to only one count of violation of the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), he is regarded as a first-time offender, and thus reached a settlement with federal authorities to step down as CEO and not relinquish his interest in the company or have assets frozen.\n\n\"Typically, personal assets that are not directly linked to the criminal activity might remain unaffected,\" said Braden Perry, a former senior trial lawyer for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. \"His assets could also be managed on his behalf while he is incarcerated.\"\n\nThat's a different siutation from Sam Bankman-Fried, the controversial ex-CEO and founder of crypto exchange FTX. Bankman-Fried, who's commonly referred to as \"SBF,\" saw his wealth reduced to zero after his crypto empire collapsed into bankruptcy in 2022.\n\n\"In relation to CZ's personal wealth ... he would still be able to retain his share in Binance, as well as maintain his crypto holdings which also contribute an unknown, yet material, amount to his overall wealth and net worth,\" Joshua de Vos, research lead at CCData, told CNBC via email.\n\n\"Since there is no misappropriation or bankruptcy proceedings, it is highly unlikely that CZ would see his wealth reduced to zero as was the case with SBF,\" de Vos said.\n\nWhat's more, Zhao has gotten off much easier in sentencing than former crypto rival Bankman-Fried. Bankman-Fried received a 25-year prison term for crimes connected to the operation of his crypto exchange.\n\nUnlike Zhao and the charges brought against Binance, Bankman-Fried's bankrupt exchange faced allegations of fraud and misuse of customers' funds.\n\nExperts say that Zhao's net worth is likely to continue rising as buoyant crypto prices, which tend to support trading activity on Binance, boost his own personal fortune.\n\n\"CZ will now be one of the wealthiest people in prison,\" said Yesha Yadav, law professor and associate dean at Vanderbilt University.\n\nThat's even after a litany of legal troubles, including the Department of Justice's case against it, and several other high-profile lawsuits -- including one from the Securities and Exchange Commission which remains ongoing.\n\nThe SEC has accused Binance of making multiple unregistered offers and sales of crypto asset securities.

        "text": "The ALS Ice Bucket Challenge is still going strong, thanks to its mix of suspense, physical comedy, and contributions for a worthy cause. Business and entertainment moguls from around the world have participated, and recently even inanimate objects have started taking part with Samsung's Galaxy S5 smartphone being doused by the Korean conglomerate's U.K. division.\n\nAs per the rules of the challenge, Samsung then exercised its right to pass the dare onto someone else, and it designated rival Apple's iPhone 5s. A quick comparison of the spec sheets for the two competing phones has some people crying foul at singling out the iPhone 5s, though. Today, we're offering Samsung a chance to make things right.\n\nSee, there's a key difference between the Galaxy S5 and the iPhone 5s, which is that the former is waterproof, and the latter isn't. The comedic potential of the Ice Bucket Challenge is that it makes human participants uncomfortable without killing them, but you wouldn't be able to say the same with the Apple model called out by Samsung. Since the deluge would likely destroy the phone, Samsung's actions are a bit like daring someone to dump a bucket of fire over his head instead of one filled with ice water.\n\n▼ If \"bucket of fire\" is too hard to imagine, then just think of a container of poisonous spiders.\n\nSome have accused the Korean manufacturer of shamelessly taking advantage of the charity challenge for no reason other than to publicly reiterate the fact that the Galaxy S5 is waterproof, and that the iPhone 5s isn't (and, for the record, Sony has been doing waterproof smartphones a lot longer). There's at least one man who still has faith in Samsung, though, and that's our Japanese-language correspondent Mr. Sato.\n\n▼ Seen on the right, wearing the alternate version of the RocketNews24 summer uniform.\n\n\"They'd never do something that low!\" he insists, springing to the defense of his beloved Samsung. \"They just nominated the iPhone because it's famous! If I challenged a non-waterproof Samsung product, they'd definitely accept!\"\n\nOf course, the only way to earn the right to designate the next Ice Bucket Challenge participant is to go through it yourself. So we took Mr. Sato, plus his personal (and waterproof) Samsung tablet to the nearest park, so he could bravely do what needed to be done.\n\nNow Mr. Soaked Sato, he's thrown down the gauntlet, nominating Samsung's equally non-waterproof Galaxy Tab S for the challenge. We're willing to accept satisfaction from any of Samsung's many worldwide divisions, which is why in addition to verbally designating the Galaxy Tab S, we also put it in English.",

        "text": "Scientists from the Netherlands and South Korea have just built a device dubbed \"iontronic memristor (memory resistor),\" or in other words, an artificial synapse. This device, just a little bit wider than a human hair, mimics the part of the brain that helps us think and learn. This isn't the first time scientists have tried to tackle creating a device that can resemble the thinking of the human brain, but this one's special, because it's not built like the others -- it's built like our brains.\n\nSo, what is this brain-like device, and why is it so special? Get ready for some science talk. The iontronic memristor has a tapered microfluidic channel, shaped like a cone, inside which sits a solution of salt (potassium chloride) dissolved in water. Yes, it's literally just salt and water.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nWhen the device receives an electrical signal, the ions in the water solution move up the channel and change their position, and this movement affects the ion density and conductivity. This basically changes how well the memristor can conduct electricity, which is similar to how our brain cells connect more strongly or weakly based on our experiences.\n\nRelated We're finally getting a 4K OLED gaming monitor, and it's coming soon The most demanding PC games we're looking forward to in 2023 We're lovin' this official McDonald's gaming chair -- the McCrispy Ultimate\n\nThis might be the closest thing yet to resemble how our brains work in an artificial setting, and it's different from previous attempts at the very foundation, because it's made entirely out of water and salt as opposed to silicon and metals.\n\nAlthough memristors have been used in various conventional platforms, they're different from the human brain because they rely on only one source of information (such as electrons or holes) and only respond to electrical inputs. This differs from the way the synapses in our brains work, as they can rely on both electrical and chemical signals to get the job done.\n\nCurrent applications of artificial intelligence, even the most advanced ones, don't have the ability to think independently like human brains do. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs), while they may sound like we do, are just a collection of words that other people (and machines) have said. Their ability to create stems from learning from humans and not from their own ability to think.\n\nThe research, led by doctoral researcher Tim Kamsma, is the joint result of work carried out by the Utrecht University in the Netherlands and the Sogang University in South Korea. It's the first of its kind to use fluidic ion channels to emulate the complex fluid mechanisms in the brain; however, despite this leap, aqueous neuromorphic devices such as iontronic memristors are still in their infancy, and using them to build neuromorphic computers is still very much a work in progress.\n\nWhile we're a long way away, building devices like this is a stepping stone to the next era of AI -- something that other scientists have tried to achieve in other ways, such as by using honey.\n\nEditors' Recommendations We're getting another Amazon Prime shopping event in October this year AI breakthroughs could come via the brains of bees, scientists say We're not in a GPU shortage, but it sure feels like one Apple's AR/VR headset gets one step closer to a reality Super fast 10Gbps internet edges one step closer to your home",

        "text": "Zhao has an estimated personal net worth of $33 billion, according to Forbes' World's Billionaires list.\n\nChangpeng Zhao, the billionaire co-founder and former CEO of Binance, is expected to see his mammoth wealth remain intact and likely continue to climb even as he faces time behind bars after his sentencing in a Seattle court.\n\nZhao, who is commonly referred to as \"CZ\" in crypto circles, was sentenced to four months in prison on Tuesday, after pleading guilty to charges of enabling money laundering at his crypto exchange.\n\nThe sentence handed down to Zhao in Seattle federal court was significantly less than the three years that federal prosecutors had been seeking for him. The defense had asked for five months of probation. Sentencing guidelines called for a prison term of 12 to 18 months.\n\nA Binance spokesperson said in a statement to CNBC the crypto exchange has made \"considerable compliance enhancements,\" including with regards to anti-money laundering detection and \"hiring key compliance personnel.\"\n\nA lawyer for Zhao did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.\n\nIn November, Zhao struck a deal with the U.S. government to resolve a multiyear investigation into Binance. As part of Binance's $4.3 billion settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice, Zhao stepped down as the company's CEO, and the exchange agreed to form a board of directors with independent members, as well as compliance and audit committees.\n\nOf the seven total directors recently named to the since-formed board of directors, three were designated as being \"independent\" -- and five of them, including all of the board's independent members, submitted letters to the judge in Zhao's criminal case asking for leniency in sentencing.\n\nGabriel Abed, the board's chairman and one of its independent members, told U.S. District Judge Richard Jones that Zhao was \"distinguished by a stoic composure and genuine humility\" and that \"despite his significant achievements,\" he maintained a lifestyle marked by simplicity including dressing in clothes bought on Amazon, driving a Toyota and wearing an Apple watch.\n\nDespite Zhao now facing time in prison, industry experts and lawyers who spoke with CNBC say his tremendous personal wealth will remain unaffected and, if anything, is likely to rise.\n\nLos Angeles corporate law attorney Tre Lovell tells CNBC that the government is only entitled to any restitution or fines imposed and not to Zhao's assets or wealth as a whole. Former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani agrees, adding that Zhao's personal wealth won't be affected by his sentence.\n\n\"Because Zhao and the government came to an agreement, the government didn't get a judgment or restitution order against Zhao and do discovery into his assets,\" said Rahmani. \"He'll have significant wealth when he is released from prison.\"\n\nZhao took Binance, the cryptocurrency exchange he co-founded in 2017, from a relatively obscure company to one of the most formidable players in the booming digital currency space.\n\nDespite the fact that Zhao is being put behind bars, his controlling stake in Binance means that he will continue being one of the wealthiest people in crypto today.\n\nNotably, because Zhao pleaded guilty to only one count of violation of the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), he is regarded as a first-time offender, and thus reached a settlement with federal authorities to step down as CEO and not relinquish his interest in the company or have assets frozen.\n\n\"Typically, personal assets that are not directly linked to the criminal activity might remain unaffected,\" said Braden Perry, a former senior trial lawyer for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. \"His assets could also be managed on his behalf while he is incarcerated.\"\n\nThat's a different siutation from Sam Bankman-Fried, the controversial ex-CEO and founder of crypto exchange FTX. Bankman-Fried, who's commonly referred to as \"SBF,\" saw his wealth reduced to zero after his crypto empire collapsed into bankruptcy in 2022.\n\n\"In relation to CZ's personal wealth ... he would still be able to retain his share in Binance, as well as maintain his crypto holdings which also contribute an unknown, yet material, amount to his overall wealth and net worth,\" Joshua de Vos, research lead at CCData, told CNBC via email.\n\n\"Since there is no misappropriation or bankruptcy proceedings, it is highly unlikely that CZ would see his wealth reduced to zero as was the case with SBF,\" de Vos said.\n\nWhat's more, Zhao has gotten off much easier in sentencing than former crypto rival Bankman-Fried. Bankman-Fried received a 25-year prison term for crimes connected to the operation of his crypto exchange.\n\nUnlike Zhao and the charges brought against Binance, Bankman-Fried's bankrupt exchange faced allegations of fraud and misuse of customers' funds.\n\nExperts say that Zhao's net worth is likely to continue rising as buoyant crypto prices, which tend to support trading activity on Binance, boost his own personal fortune.\n\n\"CZ will now be one of the wealthiest people in prison,\" said Yesha Yadav, law professor and associate dean at Vanderbilt University.\n\nThat's even after a litany of legal troubles, including the Department of Justice's case against it, and several other high-profile lawsuits -- including one from the Securities and Exchange Commission which remains ongoing.\n\nThe SEC has accused Binance of making multiple unregistered offers and sales of crypto asset securities. It is not yet clear when that case will reach a conclusion.\n\nZhao had an estimated personal net worth of $33 billion on March 8, 2024, up from $10.5 billion the same time last year, according to Forbes' World's Billionaires list, which ranks the richest peopole using stock prices and exchange rates.\n\nBloomberg's Billionaires Index, a separate measure of the world's wealthiest, pegs Zhao's net worth at an even higher sum, $42.9 billion.\n\nCNBC was unable to independently verify Zhao's overall net worth.\n\nBut Zhao is widely reported to have an estimated 90% stake in Binance, and his fortune is largely derived from his equity ownership in the company.\n\nBinance is by far the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, processing $18.1 trillion worth of trading volume in 2023, according to data from crypto market data firm CCData.\n\nAround 80% -- or $14.4 trillion -- of that came from derivatives products like futures contracts, while the remaining $3.7 trillion came from spot trading.

It's gonna be a very interesting next couple of years because nobody knows, because Amazon and Apple have so much damn money, they might just outbid ESPN and Turner.\"\n\nTraina recently wrote that ESPN \"would do anything and everything\" to hire Barkley and noted that all the behind-the-scene staffers also have helped establish Inside The NBA as arguably the most popular sports studio show.\n\nWas the information in this article useful?\n\nThanks for the feedback.\n\nCopy article link Submit a story idea Join our newsletter Sign up Thanks, you're signed up.

        "text": "Michael Paul Williams\n\n\"Four years later and we're still writing the same headlines about protesters,\" read Monday night's text message from a friend. \"History always has a way of repeating itself.\"\n\nVirginia Commonwealth University responded to a pro-Palestinian encampment by summoning shield-bearing riot police who sprayed students with a chemical irritant. The college showed remarkably little forbearance for what had been a peaceful protest before a busload of police, in an act of provocation and intimidation, rolled up to the Cabell Library to forcefully evict students from the \"Liberation Zone for Gaza.\"\n\nThe scene evoked instant memories of nearly four years ago, when Richmond police deployed tear gas on peaceful protesters at the Robert E. Lee monument during the social justice protests that followed the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer.\n\nPeople are also reading... Girl Scout who created banned book nooks thanks Hanover for 'censored' Gold Award Police in riot gear, protesters clash at VCU; school says gathering violated policies Here's where the Richmond region's newest Shake Shack is going UPDATE: Chinese crime ring linked to prostitution probe at Chesterfield massage parlors 6 things to know about protests that erupted on VCU campus overnight Charlottesville socialite pleads guilty to child sex crimes Body found in woods near Richmond Raceway; police investigating Rao: VCU Health wants to end $56 million payment to Richmond Speed cameras in Chesapeake, Suffolk facing lawsuit Pedestrian killed on Lucks Lane in Chesterfield Police identify pedestrian who died after Lucks Lane crash St. Catherine's grad stars in Amazon Prime's 'Fallout' No. 5 Virginia lacrosse comes up short against No. 1 Notre Dame Google plans $1 billion data center investment in Northern Virginia RPD asked protesters to scale back marches amid spike in violence, staffing issues\n\nMonday night showed us how little has changed, not just during the past four years, but the past 54.\n\nOn May 4, 1970, Ohio National Guard members opened fire on Kent State University students protesting Richard Nixon's expansion of the Vietnam War into Cambodia. Four students were killed and nine others were wounded.\n\nEleven days later, members of the Mississippi Highway Patrol and the Jackson Police Department killed two people and injured 12 at Jackson State University. Two years earlier, in another spasm of violence more related to racial tensions than antiwar sentiment, police killed three students and injured 28 at South Carolina State College in Orangeburg, South Carolina.\n\nCollege officials can quickly lose control of events in calling police en masse to their campus. History shows us how easily things can go sideways.\n\nBy Tuesday afternoon, the lawn outside Cabell Library was tranquil, a stark contrast to the harrowing images of the police clash with protesters the night before as backlit students looked on in horror from inside the library.\n\nWilliams: Reimagining Monument Avenue is a lost cause. Stoney planted and punted.\n\nOscar Ferguson-Osborne, a junior from Silver Spring, Maryland, was one of the 13 people arrested. Tuesday afternoon, he lamented \"the fact that the university would rather call in the police to spray its own students ... instead of listening to them for a single day, a single full day, listening to their demands.\"\n\nCollege administrators, if anything, need to be less inclined to sic police on protesters and more willing to listen and learn from them. Young people have always been the ones to bend the moral arc of this nation toward justice. To paint campus calls for a cease-fire in Gaza with the broad brush of antisemitism amounts to slander. But the oppressive response of the state creates a sad sense of déjà vu.\n\n\"As a City resident and individual who was tear gassed on Grand River Avenue in East Lansing during the Viet Nam war protests back in 1970, I was appalled by the video I saw on the news this evening,\" Claire Guthrie Gastañaga, former head of the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia, said Monday. \"The pictures I saw of the action tonight showed what appeared to be use of unnecessary force to break up the encampment. There was no actual threat to public safety presented by the encampment.\"\n\n\"The one thing I would have hoped that we learned from past protest experiences is that violence always invites violence whether the initiator of the violence is the police or the protesters,\" she said.\n\nIn response to multiple Virginia universities arresting and searching students engaged in pro-Palestinian protests, current ACLU of Virginia Executive Director Mary Bauer said in a statement: \"Universities that attack their students' free speech undermine our democracy -- as well as their own mandate to foster learning and the robust exchange of ideas. The First Amendment guarantees people in Virginia the right to protest, including on behalf of Palestinians, so we're disappointed to learn that Virginia universities have deployed police against their own students for expressing their views about the ongoing conflict.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"We urge public officials and university leaders across the Commonwealth to refrain from interfering with students' free speech, and to carefully distinguish between real danger and mere controversy,\" Bauer said. \"Universities are charged with creating environments that encourage students to exercise their First Amendment rights -- not ones that have license to violate students' civil rights and civil liberties.\"\n\nThis is a nice sentiment that assumes that Americans still believe in a Constitution, or the rule of law, as a former president who forswore his oath is poised to return to office with a vengeance. President Joe Biden's unwavering support of Israel -- in the wake of Hamas' heinous terrorist attack and Israel's brutal response in Gaza -- has proven extremely unpopular with young progressives and Muslim voters.\n\nDonald Trump, who saw \"very fine people\" among the racist hatemongers who converged on Charlottesville in 2017, called that rally \"a little peanut\" compared to the \"hate\" on college campuses today. It should be noted that Nazis and other torch-bearing white supremacists managed to march without being tear-gassed or pepper-sprayed by police.\n\nVCU, in Monday's aftermath, said the students had been warned, while employing the \"outside agitators\" trope.\n\n\"VCU respectfully and repeatedly provided opportunities for those individuals involved, many of whom were not students, to collect their belongings and leave,\" the university said in a statement. \"Those who did not leave were subject to arrest for trespassing.\"\n\n\"While supporting an environment that fosters protected speech and expressive activity, VCU must maintain an atmosphere free of disruption to the university's mission,\" the statement continued.\n\nWilliams: VCU's racism class requirement needs to be back on course\n\nIt's increasingly hard to figure out what higher education's mission is nowadays. The First Amendment, critical thinking and academic freedom are under assault; elected officials and donors are increasingly eager to exert their influence to a micromanaging extent.\n\n\"VCU's mission is our students and supporting our students to develop into civically-engaged people,\" Amy Rector, director of the School of World Studies, said Monday night. Administrators clearly need the reminder.\n\nTuesday, an open letter was disseminated among VCU faculty and staff to \"condemn the decision by university administration to deploy VCUPD, RPD, and VSP in riot gear to assault and arrest students and faculty who were protesting peacefully the night of April 29, 2024. This action, including the use of chemical irritants, violated the rights of students and faculty to express their freedom of speech and academic freedom, endangered the safety of all students in the area, and undermined any remaining trust in the integrity of university leadership to support our student body.\"\n\n\"The outsized police response approved by President Rao and university leadership placed our students, their wellbeing, and their success at this university at risk,\" the letter read.\n\nAries Loumis-Demetrakopoulos, a Ph.D. student at VCU, noted that Richmond Police had recently reached out to a pro-Palestinian activist about reducing the frequency of protests because the department was hamstrung in responding to a spike in gun violence.\n\n\"We can see that last night they do have the resources to handle this,\" he said. \"And let's just be honest: We've never seen a response like we did last night to gun violence in Richmond.\"\n\nSadly, the suppression of protest looks like a burgeoning Richmond tradition. The body of evidence on other college campuses nationwide is not encouraging.\n\nWe've always tended to overstate America's embrace of dissent, as if those police dogs, fire hose blasts and tear gas cannisters aimed at protesters -- and yes, even bullets -- were somehow an aberration. At moments like this, our institutions function as designed.\n\nThese crackdowns seldom pass the test of history. But this history of suppression is bound to repeat itself until we acknowledge that this is who we are.\n\nGallery: Police confront protesters at VCU; arrests made\n\nMichael Paul Williams (804) 649-6815\n\nmwilliams@timesdispatch.com\n\nMichael Paul Williams\n\nColumnist\n\nAuthor twitter Author email Follow Michael Paul Williams Close Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!

Everett Dirksen is credited with the famous phrase \"a billion here, a billion there, and pretty soon you're talking real money.\"\n\nThe senator from Illinois, who died in 1969, was supposedly complaining about excessive federal spending, and while some dispute that he actually said those words, the line has found a place in history.\n\nRelated: Analyst updates SoFi stock outlook after earnings\n\nMichael Saylor also knows a thing or two about real money.\n\nThe co-founder and executive chairman of MicroStrategy (MSTR) once lost $6 billion in a single day back in 2020, after the business-intelligence company announced accounting mistakes and the stock dropped.\n\nSaylor, who stepped down as MicroStrategy's CEO in 2022, reached a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission that included an $8.3 million personal disgorgement.\n\nHe has also been a bitcoin evangelist, and he spoke about the primary digital currency during MicroStrategy's first-quarter-earnings call.\n\n\"This quarter,\" he said, \"it's the end of the crypto childhood or the crypto cowboy era, where you had had 15 years of lots of confusion, chaos, and jockeying of thousands and thousands of crypto assets.\"\n\n\"Well, bitcoin is the winner, and it is the one emergent institutional asset that has come out of that 15 years,\" Saylor said.\n\nMicroStrategy's co-founder calls bitcoin 'unique'\n\nInvestors' interest in bitcoin soared with January's introduction of bitcoin exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, particularly the ones offered by BlackRock and Fidelity Investments.\n\n\"And so, bitcoin is very unique,\" Saylor said. \"It's the one crypto asset that a publicly traded company can hold on its balance sheet, can capitalize upon.\"\n\nRelated: Analyst revamps Apple stock rating ahead of key earnings report\n\nSaylor maintained that entire modern institutional asset economy, the options market, the securities market, the money manager system, the institutional mutual funds, the institutional ETFs, are all going to be centered around bitcoin as the digital property going forward.\n\n\"And so, while we're at the end of the beginning, you know, we're now, I would say, at the beginning of the middle,\" he said.\n\nMicroStrategy posted a first-quarter loss of $3.09 per share on April 29, swinging from earnings of $31.79 a year earlier and missing the FactSet analyst consensus calling for a loss of 55 cents a share.\n\nThe latest result reflected a $192 million bitcoin impairment charge, \"the result of bitcoin price fluctuations throughout this past quarter,\" the company said. The charge in the year-earlier period was $20 million.\n\nRevenue totaled $115 million, down from $126 million a year earlier and short of FactSet's call for $121.7 million.\n\nBitcoin was down 3% to $60,864 at last check, while MicroStrategy was tumbling 15.5% to $1,092. The company's executives still pledged their allegiance to crypto.\n\nAndrew Kang, MicroStrategy's chief financial officer, said the company was the world's largest corporate holder of bitcoin, \"and we remain committed to our bitcoin acquisition strategy with the utmost conviction, long-term focus, and with a strong risk-managed approach.\"\n\nCEO: 'we're highly committed to bitcoin strategy'\n\nPresident and CEO Phong Le told analysts \"we remain highly committed to our bitcoin strategy with a long-term focus.\"\n\n\"This past quarter, the price of bitcoin appreciated significantly, spurred notably by the approval of the spot bitcoin exchange-traded products or ETPs, which has drawn considerable institutional attention,\" he said.\n\nMore Tech Stocks:\n\nHe said the company believed that the introduction of spot bitcoin ETPs \"further evidences the maturation of bitcoin as an institutional grade asset class with broader regulatory recognition and institutional adoption.\"\n\nCanaccord lowered its price target on MicroStrategy to $1,590 from $1,810 while affirming a buy rating on the shares.\n\nThe investment firm said the company's strategy was again in full swing in the first quarter, given the approvals of U.S.-listed spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nMicroStrategy raised more than $1.5 billion in the first quarter and used the proceeds to acquire an additional 25,250 bitcoin. It now owns 214,400 BTC valued around $13.6 billion, Canaccord told investors in a research report.\n\nBitcoin recently marked its fourth halving, where the reward for mining the crypto is split in half. Halvings reduce the rate at which new coins are created, lowering the available amount of new supply.\n\nCanaccord said that with the recent halving event, the amount of new bitcoin mined per day has been reduced by 50%.\n\nRelated: Veteran fund manager picks favorite stocks for 2024",

Former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani agrees, adding that Zhao's personal wealth won't be affected by his sentence.\n\n\"Because Zhao and the government came to an agreement, the government didn't get a judgment or restitution order against Zhao and do discovery into his assets,\" said Rahmani. \"He'll have significant wealth when he is released from prison.\"\n\nZhao took Binance, the cryptocurrency exchange he co-founded in 2017, from a relatively obscure company to one of the most formidable players in the booming digital currency space.\n\nDespite the fact that Zhao is being put behind bars, his controlling stake in Binance means that he will continue being one of the wealthiest people in crypto today.\n\nNotably, because Zhao pleaded guilty to only one count of violation of the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), he is regarded as a first-time offender, and thus reached a settlement with federal authorities to step down as CEO and not relinquish his interest in the company or have assets frozen.\n\n\"Typically, personal assets that are not directly linked to the criminal activity might remain unaffected,\" said Braden Perry, a former senior trial lawyer for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. \"His assets could also be managed on his behalf while he is incarcerated.\"\n\nThat's a different siutation from Sam Bankman-Fried, the controversial ex-CEO and founder of crypto exchange FTX. Bankman-Fried, who's commonly referred to as \"SBF,\" saw his wealth reduced to zero after his crypto empire collapsed into bankruptcy in 2022.\n\n\"In relation to CZ's personal wealth ... he would still be able to retain his share in Binance, as well as maintain his crypto holdings which also contribute an unknown, yet material, amount to his overall wealth and net worth,\" Joshua de Vos, research lead at CCData, told CNBC via email.\n\n\"Since there is no misappropriation or bankruptcy proceedings, it is highly unlikely that CZ would see his wealth reduced to zero as was the case with SBF,\" de Vos said.\n\nWhat's more, Zhao has gotten off much easier in sentencing than former crypto rival Bankman-Fried. Bankman-Fried received a 25-year prison term for crimes connected to the operation of his crypto exchange.\n\nUnlike Zhao and the charges brought against Binance, Bankman-Fried's bankrupt exchange faced allegations of fraud and misuse of customers' funds.\n\nExperts say that Zhao's net worth is likely to continue rising as buoyant crypto prices, which tend to support trading activity on Binance, boost his own personal fortune.\n\n\"CZ will now be one of the wealthiest people in prison,\" said Yesha Yadav, law professor and associate dean at Vanderbilt University.\n\nThat's even after a litany of legal troubles, including the Department of Justice's case against it, and several other high-profile lawsuits -- including one from the Securities and Exchange Commission which remains ongoing.\n\nThe SEC has accused Binance of making multiple unregistered offers and sales of crypto asset securities. It is not yet clear when that case will reach a conclusion.\n\nZhao had an estimated personal net worth of $33 billion on March 8, 2024, up from $10.5 billion the same time last year, according to Forbes' World's Billionaires list, which ranks the richest peopole using stock prices and exchange rates.\n\nBloomberg's Billionaires Index, a separate measure of the world's wealthiest, pegs Zhao's net worth at an even higher sum, $42.9 billion.\n\nCNBC was unable to independently verify Zhao's overall net worth.\n\nBut Zhao is widely reported to have an estimated 90% stake in Binance, and his fortune is largely derived from his equity ownership in the company.\n\nBinance is by far the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, processing $18.1 trillion worth of trading volume in 2023, according to data from crypto market data firm CCData.\n\nAround 80% -- or $14.4 trillion -- of that came from derivatives products like futures contracts, while the remaining $3.7 trillion came from spot trading. Derivatives trading is a key part of Binance's business.\n\nAnd even though Binance has seen its market share drop to 41.6% since Zhao stepped down as CEO in November 2023, the company remains the dominant player overall -- leagues ahead of South Korean exchange Upbit, Dubai-headquartered Bybit, and U.S. giant Coinbase.\n\nZhao has said previously he has personal investments in bitcoin and Binance's own BNB token, however he's not disclosed the value of those holdings. Binance Coin, or BNB, is up 83% so far this year to $576.\n\nLucas Kiely, chief investment officer of digital wealth platform Yield App, said that Zhao's \"significant stake in the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume positions him to potentially benefit from the overall growth of the crypto market.\"\n\nThe recent approval of a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund in the U.S. has led to renewed interest in the crypto market, and helped trigger a wave of fresh institutional investment, according to Kiely -- and that's sure to be a boon to Binance.\n\n\"Such developments could contribute to the growth of Binance and, by extension, CZ's wealth,\" he told CNBC.\n\nZhao has been hit with a partial knock to his overall fortune -- he was forced to pay a $50 million fine, in addition to the $4.3 billion in fines and forfeiture Binance was ordered to pay for violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act and sanctions on Iran. Yadav noted that it's also possible Zhao makes some contribution to the billions Binance owes to the government.\n\nYadav tells CNBC that even though CZ's vast wealth is not directly under threat by virtue of his conviction and the sentencing today, there may still be some indirect effects.\n\n\"Negative long-term impact on Binance will diminish the value of CZ's investment in the crypto exchange,\" said Yadav. \"Conversely, however, CZ may even benefit if Binance begins a path to recovery following today's sentencing, the plea deal and monitorship arrangement, and regains its market share over time as a result.\"",

        "text": "TNT's contract with the NBA expires after the 2024-25 season. The network is facing major competition for the league's package, which could put the future of Inside The NBA in jeopardy.\n\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, NBCUniversal is willing to pay $2.5 billion to redirect NBA games to NBC and Peacock. The NBA could leave TNT after a 35-year partnership.\n\nHowever, the network's iconic studio show wouldn't necessarily end.\n\nOn The Town podcast, Puck entertainment reporter Matthew Belloni speculated that another platform gaining NBA rights would pick up Inside The NBA.\n\n\"There's a real chance here that Warner (Bros.) Discovery does not get NBA rights,\" Belloni said, via Awful Announcing. \"And if it does get NBA rights, the amount of games is going to be very small, likely. My prediction is that Inside the NBA, the Turner studio show that everybody loves, will not exclusively air on TNT after the 2024-25 season.\n\n\"It's either going to be on Amazon, or it's going to be on TNT and another one of those outlets, Amazon or NBC.\"\n\nAccording to The Athletic's Andrew Marchand, Amazon Prime Video has a deal in place to put \"significant\" regular and postseason NBA games on the streaming service starting in 2025.\n\nEven if another outlet lands Inside The NBA, it's hard to picture the show staying the same.\n\nThere's no guarantee the team of Charles Barkley, Shaquille O'Neal, Kenny Smith, and Ernie Johnson all make the move. Johnson has a long working relationship with TNT, and Barkley said he'd \"would find it hard\" to do the show anywhere without the longtime host.\n\n\"Ernie is the one guy we probably have to worry about more than anybody walking anyway,\" Barkley told Sports Illustrated's Jimmy Traina last year. \"I'm gonna stay at least two more years, but Ernie, I know he's toyed with the idea of leaving in the next couple years also. It's gonna be a very interesting next couple of years because nobody knows, because Amazon and Apple have so much damn money, they might just outbid ESPN and Turner.\"\n\nTraina recently wrote that ESPN \"would do anything and everything\" to hire Barkley and noted that all the behind-the-scene staffers also have helped establish Inside The NBA as arguably the most popular sports studio show.",

        "text": "From his chats with Tesla boss Elon Musk to his Stanford University sweaters, Rishi Sunak has made no secret of his admiration for Silicon Valley and its start-ups-turned-tech behemoths.\n\nBut has the UK prime minister, who worked in California from his mid-twenties to his early thirties, drawn the right lessons about why Google, Apple and Facebook are so wildly successful, asks the economist Daniel Susskind in Growth: A Reckoning, his new book exploring how politicians might deliver on oft-repeated promises to fix sluggish productivity and kick-start growth.\n\nResources for higher education professionals on research management\n\nSpecifically, does Mr Sunak appreciate the immense continuing research and development investments made by the world's leading technology companies? For example, Google's parent company, Alphabet, spent $27.6 billion (£22 billion) on R&D in 2020, or 15.1 per cent of its revenue, while Facebook ploughed $18.5 billion (21 per cent) into research and Microsoft $19.3 billion (13 per cent), noted Professor Susskind, a research professor in economics at King's College London whose 2018 TED Talk on the future of work has been viewed more than 1.5 million times.\n\nIn contrast, the Westminster government \"slapped itself on the back\" when it announced that UK Research and Innovation's budget would hit £8.8 billion in 2024-25, Professor Susskind observed about the \"first-order problem\" of unambitious R&D spending, a failing not confined to the UK either, given the \"investment drought\" seen in other developed countries since the mid-1970s.\n\n\"Rishi is pro-business and pro-R&D and knows research investment is important,\" Professor Susskind, who served as a Downing Street adviser under Gordon Brown and Lord Cameron of Chipping Norton, told Times Higher Education. \"But if you look at what he's done, he maybe thinks R&D isn't important enough,\" he said, referencing the government's innovation outlay, which despite having risen to almost 3 per cent of gross domestic product and nearly £20 billion annually, is still well behind other nations with science superpower ambitions of their own.\n\n\"If you compare us to Israel or South Korea, our R&D investment is very low. But other comparisons are more astonishing, with innovative companies routinely investing 15 per cent of revenues into R&D,\" continued Professor Susskind. \"While a company is not a country, this level of investment gives you an idea of the importance of this spending.\"\n\nFor Professor Susskind, the question of how to generate more economic growth is really the \"same thing as asking, 'How do we generate more ideas?'\", he writes in his follow-up to A World Without Work, his acclaimed 2020 best-seller. His prescription is \"investing vastly more in R&D\", with universities key to this. \"Universities are ideas factories - it's where people should be spending time. They're incredibly important, though the key issue is less the effectiveness of universities [in developing products and companies] but their role in the innovation ecosystem,\" he said, adding that \"the most impressive innovations tend to arise through collaborations with industry\".\n\nProfessor Susskind's impassioned call for \"far more\" R&D spending is also critical of university-based research, drawing attention to the \"administrative bloat\" that he links to a decline in research productivity. In the US, for example, managerial and professional staff outnumber faculty and indeed undergraduate students at Harvard and Yale universities, he explains in Growth.\n\nWith researchers spending about 40 per cent of their time on grant administration \"rather than coming up with new ideas\", there is \"no doubt that our universities have a case to answer\" for sometimes underwhelming results, Professor Susskind concludes.\n\nGiven this situation, far higher investment in technology might be the key to raising research productivity and boosting economic growth, rather than \"ever more education and training\", suggests Professor Susskind, who notes that Google's artificial intelligence arm, DeepMind, managed within just a few years to generate 3D visualisations of molecule proteins, providing a solution that had long eluded academic researchers.\n\nIn future, R&D policy should \"turn to technology and build computer systems that either help researchers in their hunt for new ideas or even replace them altogether\", writes Professor Susskind, who believes that \"new ideas will be found and shared outside our minds\".\n\n\"There are few things that politicians agree upon, but the need for more economic growth is one of them. But they have a very 19th-century conception of where it comes from: building impressive physical things like new roads or train lines,\" said Professor Susskind, who claimed that spending £200 million to improve poor wi-fi on British trains would deliver about a third of the economic benefit of HS2's high-speed London-Birmingham rail line at about 0.5 per cent of the cost.\n\nIn the same way, comparatively modest investments in artificial intelligence will be \"absolutely critical in driving the creation of new ideas\", Professor Susskind said.\n\n\"There are investments which aren't exciting, but they are low-hanging fruit - these are what drives growth in today's economy,\" he said.",

        "text": "DAILY PROGRESS STAFF\n\nCHARLOTTESVILLE -- Students at the University of Virginia are planning a \"day-long liberated zone\" on the school's Lawn Wednesday to demonstrate their solidarity with the Palestinian people as Israel continues to lay siege to the Palestinian territory of Gaza.\n\nWhile the event was scheduled to start Wednesday, a small but growing group of dozens had already set up camp by the UVa Chapel adjacent to the Lawn Tuesday evening just before press time. It was unclear at press time if that early encampment would remain after organizers announced police had asked them to clear the area.\n\nAn unknown number of people are expected to come together on the Lawn Wednesday to \"call for and END to the occupation and an end to our institutions' complicity in genocide,\" according to an Instagram post from UVA Dissenters, one of the organizing groups. The organization describes itself as \"a collective of anti-imperialist organizers working to turn the tide against endless war.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

Organizers chose the date to align with an anti-war protest that took place on the Lawn in 1970, when thousands of students held demonstrations to voice their opposition to the United States' decision to expand the Vietnam War into Cambodia.\n\nThe weeklong protests are remembered as May Days: Classes were canceled, protesters occupied the Naval ROTC building (now John Warner Hall) and police stormed the Lawn, jailing dozens.\n\nThe UVA Dissenters Instagram post specifically highlights that time on Grounds as an inspiration for its current plans.\n\n\"During the 'May Days' strike of 1970, UVA students announced a 'Freedom Day' to rally students together in their opposition to the U.S. imperialist war in Vietnam,\" the post reads.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nWhile that 1970 episode took place over the course of several days, Wednesday's demonstration is planned to be a daylong event, according to organizers. It does not say whether protesters plan to remain on the Lawn beyond Wednesday.\n\nThe demonstration comes on the heels of protests that have erupted at universities across the country, including in Virginia. Protesters have been arrested at encampments and \"liberated zones\" at the University of Mary Washington, Virginia Tech and Virginia Commonwealth University in the past week. In the latter case, police in riot gear deployed pepper spray and clashed with protesters before the crowd was dispersed; roughly a dozen people were arrested.\n\nThat was on Monday, just one day after Gov. Glenn Youngkin said that protests at public colleges in the commonwealth must remain peaceful, or face the consequences.\n\n\"We will protect the ability to peacefully express yourself, but we're not going to have the kinds of hate speech and intimidation that we're seeing across the country in Virginia,\" he said in a statement.\n\nAs with so many other colleges where protests have taken place, UVa students are demanding that the university divest itself from all financial ties to Israel, which has been locked in a monthslong war with Palestinian terrorist group Hamas that has killed more than 34,000 since Hamas' surprise attack on Oct. 7 of last year.\n\nOn Tuesday, Republican Rep. Bob Good, who represents UVa and the surrounding 5th District in Congress, wrote a letter to UVa President Jim Ryan.\n\n\"I urge you to demonstrate courageous and decisive leadership and take appropriate action to protect Jewish students and faculty by upholding Title Viand eliminating any visible demonstrations of antisemitism at UVA,\" Good wrote.\n\nThe Daily Progress reached out to both UVa officials and the Virginia State Police regarding their own plans for Wednesday, but did not hear back before press time.\n\nUVa Final Exercises are planned to take place the weekend of May 18 this year. At colleges nationwide there is concern that the ongoing protests will interfere or cancel graduation plans.\n\n0 Comments Tags Politics Armed Forces Education University Crime Religion Criminal Law Internet Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.",

It now owns 214,400 BTC valued around $13.6 billion, Canaccord told investors in a research report.\n\nBitcoin recently marked its fourth halving, where the reward for mining the crypto is split in half. Halvings reduce the rate at which new coins are created, lowering the available amount of new supply.\n\nCanaccord said that with the recent halving event, the amount of new bitcoin mined per day has been reduced by 50%.\n\nRelated: Veteran fund manager picks favorite stocks for 2024",

        "text": "There's been a lot of talk about the Rabbit R1. Fuelled by more hype than substance, the cute little Teenage Engineering designed gadget has been savaged in the press this week, particularly by MKBHD.\n\nAs he says in his review, it has a low price, and an even lower battery life, requiring multiple charges a day. It also straight up lies to you about basic observations. Which is fine. Everyone but tech-bro grifters already know that's going to happen from time to time with LLMs.\n\nBut as you can see in the video above, it turns out the device really could have just been an app after all. Android Authority managed to download and run the app on a regular Google Pixel 6A. And while it doesn't exactly work as well as it might on the real hardware, it still appears to run fine and even answer questions.\n\nAs we saw with the launch of Humane's Ai Pin, Rabbit's CEO is keen to play the victim after seeing negative reviews. Just like the crypto hype-beasts before them, the overpromising of AI has started to catch up to some of these founders.\n\nAnd begs the question: why not just state the facts in the first place? This isn't the first tech category to have a rough start, but the difference is Apple wasn't claiming the iPhone was a DSLR when it launched. Microsoft didn't claim the Xbox was a supercomputer. Google didn't pretend that Gmail wasn't just a great web-based email client with a lot of storage for the time. I was definitely inspired by this tweet in this observation:\n\nIn its current state, AI is just being given the same runway that crypto got in terms of \"potential\". While in reality, either these tech founders are lying to us our lying to themselves about what these products are capable of. Just ship a nice little orange MP3 player that can sometimes tell you who the actor is in a movie and be done with it. I honestly would have bought that.",

        "text": "Changpeng Zhao, the billionaire co-founder and former CEO of Binance, is expected to see his mammoth wealth remain intact and likely continue to climb even as he faces time behind bars after his sentencing in a Seattle court.\n\nZhao, who is commonly referred to as \"CZ\" in crypto circles, was sentenced to four months in prison on Tuesday, after pleading guilty to charges of enabling money laundering at his crypto exchange.\n\nThe sentence handed down to Zhao in Seattle federal court was significantly less than the three years that federal prosecutors had been seeking for him. The defense had asked for five months of probation. Sentencing guidelines called for a prison term of 12 to 18 months.\n\nA Binance spokesperson said in a statement to CNBC the crypto exchange has made \"considerable compliance enhancements,\" including with regards to anti-money laundering detection and \"hiring key compliance personnel.\"\n\nA lawyer for Zhao did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.\n\nIn November, Zhao struck a deal with the U.S. government to resolve a multiyear investigation into Binance. As part of Binance's $4.3 billion settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice, Zhao stepped down as the company's CEO, and the exchange agreed to form a board of directors with independent members, as well as compliance and audit committees.\n\nOf the seven total directors recently named to the since-formed board of directors, three were designated as being \"independent\" -- and five of them, including all of the board's independent members, submitted letters to the judge in Zhao's criminal case asking for leniency in sentencing.\n\nGabriel Abed, the board's chairman and one of its independent members, told U.S. District Judge Richard Jones that Zhao was \"distinguished by a stoic composure and genuine humility\" and that \"despite his significant achievements,\" he maintained a lifestyle marked by simplicity including dressing in clothes bought on Amazon, driving a Toyota and wearing an Apple watch.\n\nDespite Zhao now facing time in prison, industry experts and lawyers who spoke with CNBC say his tremendous personal wealth will remain unaffected and, if anything, is likely to rise.\n\nLos Angeles corporate law attorney Tre Lovell tells CNBC that the government is only entitled to any restitution or fines imposed and not to Zhao's assets or wealth as a whole. Former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani agrees, adding that Zhao's personal wealth won't be affected by his sentence.\n\n\"Because Zhao and the government came to an agreement, the government didn't get a judgment or restitution order against Zhao and do discovery into his assets,\" said Rahmani. \"He'll have significant wealth when he is released from prison.\"",

        "text": "Howard Fischer\n\nPHOENIX -- Gov. Katie Hobbs won't let Republican lawmakers strip away the attorney general's right to sue owners of corporate farms whose groundwater pumping dries up their neighbors' wells.\n\nNor will she allow them to erect hurdles for others who file \"nuisance'' lawsuits about the loss of groundwater.\n\nIn her veto of HB 2124 on Tuesday, Hobbs did not address the claims of Democratic Attorney General Kris Mayes that such a change in law would undermine her ability to protect property owners \"where individuals may lack the resources to fight these battles.''\n\nInstead, Hobbs chided lawmakers who have been approving a series of changes in water laws on a piece-meal basis.\n\n\"I have consistently stated that water policy needs to be addressed in a holistic manner that provides real solutions for the challenges we face throughout the state,'' the Democratic governor wrote. \"I look forward to continuing to work with both the House and the Senate to craft a package of proposals that does exactly that.''\n\nPeople are also reading... Aldi is opening its first Tucson grocery store Interstate 40 lanes reopen in northern Arizona after N.M train derailment Hobbs vetoes bills on school showers, residency for voting, squatters, more New left-turn rules in effect at major Tucson intersections New retail development coming to Marana Ruben Douglas, former NCAA scoring champ at New Mexico, one-time Arizona Wildcat, dies at 44 95-year-old Tucson high-rise building to be sold at auction County closes Campbell Avenue hiking trail after more than 40 years Woman killed, three wounded in Tucson house party shooting Ranking the craziest foods at this year's Pima County Fair 🍨 50 fun events happening in Tucson this weekend April 25-28 🎠🎨 See what's being cut: U of A releases preliminary budgets for colleges Councilwoman threatens to picket home of 'notorious South Tucson slumlord' U of A student, 20, killed in quadruple shooting at Tucson party; Robbins speaks out Winning $12 million lottery ticket sold in Marana\n\nHobbs used much of the same wording in her veto of HB 2063, which would have allowed the owners of certain wells, now exempt from having to register with the Arizona Department of Water Resources, a right to withdraw up to 35 gallons per minute.\n\nA bigger issue is the effort in HB 2124 to expand existing laws designed to protect agriculture.\n\nThose statutes already give these operations substantial immunity from nuisance lawsuits. There also are requirements for a court to award legal fees in these cases if the litigation was not filed in good faith or it was done to harass the other party.\n\nRep. Austin Smith sought to add an automatic entitlement of court costs and legal fees if the lawsuit \"was filed to take away or reduce the water used by the other property.'' More to the point, the proposal by the Wittman Republican would have that occur regardless of whether the person filing the suit was acting in bad faith.\n\nThat's just part of the concern Mayes had with the legislation.\n\nAfter gaining House approval, Republican Sen. Sine Kerr, a Buckeye dairy farmer, added language stripping from existing laws the ability of the state attorney general to file any sort of nuisance lawsuit at all.\n\nThis came as Mayes said she was looking to use nuisance laws to go after farmers who use existing state laws to legally pump unlimited quantities of groundwater.\n\nWhile there are legal restrictions governing pumping in some urban areas, rural agriculture is largely unregulated, with farmers who own or lease land pretty much able to withdraw what they can without limit. In fact, efforts to require farmers just to report how much they are withdrawing have failed to get legislative approval.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThat has left Mayes looking for other ways to curb the practice, launching investigations into whether the activities of corporate farms are damaging their neighbors. The attorney general said she was hearing from residents \"whose wells have gone dry or will in the near future thanks to mega-farms and Wall Street hedge funds who knew they could take advantage of our state.''\n\nShe specifically named the Saudi Farm owned by Fondomonte in La Paz County and the Riverview Dairy in Cochise County.\n\nThe ammunition Mayes has -- what HB 2491 sought to take away from her -- is that laws declare \"nuisances'' are any activities that improperly injure, inconvenience, annoy or cause damage to others.\n\nIn general, nuisance laws in Arizona are built on the concept that someone's otherwise legal use of property may affect the ability of someone else to use or enjoy his her her own property.\n\nMayes said she has sent \"dozens of investigators'' to La Paz and Cochise counties to look at complaints of wells drying up, the cracking of home foundations, and fissures she said are threatening homes. She said she has hired a hydro geologist who could provide expert testimony that would be necessary to successfully pursue such litigation.\n\nIn a letter to Hobbs seeking a veto, Mayes said the authority of her office to file nuisance complaints on behalf of affected residents protects communities and water supply, \"filling in the gap where individuals may lack the resources to fight these battles.''\n\nThere have been other efforts to limit pumping.\n\nThe state did cancel leases it had with Fondomonte, which grew alfalfa to feed dairy cattle in the Middle East. But the company continues to farm on other private lands in Arizona.\n\nRiverview Dairy bought more than 50,000 acres of land to farm near Willcox.\n\nMayes does have a backup plan if, for whatever reason, nuisance lawsuits fail to produce the desired result: To take the issue of groundwater pumping directly to voters with an initiative.\n\nThat suggestion, however, drew criticism from both Smith, who co-chairs a special House panel named to investigate Mayes, as well as Rep. Jacqueline Parker, R-Mesa, the chair of what has been dubbed the Ad Hoc Committee on Executive Oversight.\n\n\"Publicly advocating for a ballot measure raises questions about your ability to impartially perform any duties required for any future ballot measure relating to groundwater issues,'' they wrote to Mayes.\n\nIn that letter, they also cited the financial damage that could be done to agriculture if Mayes pursues the issue of investigating -- and potentially curbing -- groundwater pumping.\n\nHoward Fischer is a veteran journalist who has been reporting since 1970 and covering state politics and the Legislature since 1982.

        "text": "Donald Trump has been fined $9,000 for repeatedly violating a gag order that barred him from making public statements about witnesses, jurors and some others connected to his New York hush money case. Read more: https://bit.ly/49Yfv2r\n\nNEW YORK -- Donald Trump was held in contempt of court Tuesday and fined $9,000 for repeatedly violating a gag order that barred him from making public statements about witnesses, jurors and some others connected to his New York hush money case. If he does it again, the judge warned, he could be jailed.\n\nProsecutors had alleged 10 violations, but New York Judge Juan M. Merchan found there were nine. Trump stared down at the table in front of him as the judge read the ruling, frowning slightly. He didn't speak to reporters as he entered and exited the court during trial breaks.\n\nIt was a stinging rebuke of the Republican former president's insistence that he was exercising his free speech rights and a reminder that he's a criminal defendant subject to the harsh realities of trial procedure. And the judge's remarkable threat to jail a former president signaled that Trump's already precarious legal standing could further spiral depending on his behavior during the remainder of the trial.\n\nMerchan wrote that he is \"keenly aware of, and protective of,\" Trump's First Amendment rights, \"particularly given his candidacy for the office of President of the United States.\"\n\n\"It is critically important that defendant's legitimate free speech rights not be curtailed, that he be able to fully campaign for the office which he seeks and that he be able to respond and defend himself against political attacks,\" Merchan wrote.\n\nStill, he warned that the court would not tolerate \"willful violations of its lawful orders and that if necessary and appropriate under the circumstances, it will impose an incarceratory punishment.\"\n\nWith that statement, the judge drew nearer the specter of Trump becoming the first former president of the United States behind bars.\n\nTrump is used to having constant access to his social media bullhorn to slam opponents and speak his mind. After he was banned from Twitter following the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol by his supporters, Trump launched his own platform, where his posts wouldn't be blocked or restricted. He has long tried to distance himself from controversial messages he's amplified to his millions of followers by insisting they're \"only retweets.\"\n\nBut he does have experience with gag orders, which were also imposed in his civil fraud trial. After he was found to have violated those orders, he paid more than $15,000 in fines.\n\nTuesday's ruling came at the start of the second week of testimony in the historic case, in which Manhattan prosecutors argue Trump and his associates took part in an illegal scheme to influence the 2016 presidential campaign by purchasing and then burying seamy stories. The payouts went to a doorman with a torrid yarn; ex-Playboy model Karen McDougal, who had accusations of an affair; and to porn performer Stormy Daniels, who alleged a sexual encounter with Trump. He has pleaded not guilty and says the stories are all fake.\n\nTrump was ordered to pay the gag-order fine by the close of business Friday, and he deleted, as ordered, the offending posts from his Truth Social account and campaign website Tuesday. The judge was also weighing other alleged gag-order violations by Trump and will hear arguments Thursday. He also announced that he will halt the trial on May 17 to allow Trump to attend his son Barron's high school graduation.\n\nOf the 10 posts, the one Merchan ruled was not a violation came on April 10, a post referring to witnesses Michael Cohen and Daniels as \"sleaze bags.\" Merchan said Trump's contention that he was responding to previous posts by Cohen \"is sufficient to give\" him pause on whether the post was a violation.\n\nMerchan cautioned that the gag order \"not be used as a sword instead of a shield by potential witnesses\" and that if people who are protected by the order, like Cohen, continue to attack Trump \"it becomes apparent\" they don't need the gag order's protection.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nCohen, Trump's former attorney, has said he will refrain from commenting about Trump until after he testifies at the trial. On Tuesday, he said in a text message to The Associated Press: \"The imposed fine is irrelevant. Judge Merchan's decision elucidates that this behavior will not be tolerated and that no one is above the law.\"\n\nIn other developments, testimony resumed Tuesday with a banker who helped Cohen open accounts, including one used to buy Daniels' silence. Trump's attorneys have suggested that they were engaged in an effort to protect his name and his family -- not to influence the outcome of the presidential election.\n\nJurors also began hearing from Keith Davidson, a lawyer who represented McDougal and Daniels in their negotiations with the National Enquirer and Cohen. He testified that he arranged a meeting at his Los Angeles office during the summer of 2016 to see whether the tabloid's parent company was interested in McDougal's story. At first they demurred, saying she \"lacked documentary evidence of the interaction,\" Davidson testified.\n\nBut the tabloid eventually bought the rights and Davidson testified that he understood it would never be published. Asked why the tabloid's parent company company, American Media Inc., would buy a story it didn't intend to run, Davidson said he was aware of two reasons.\n\n\"One explanation I was given is they were trying to build Karen into a brand and didn't want to diminish her brand,\" he said. \"And the second was an unspoken understanding that there was an affiliation between David Pecker and Donald Trump and that AMI wouldn't run this story, any story related to Karen, because it would hurt Donald Trump.\"\n\nAs for Daniels, the October 2016 leak of Trump's 2005 \"Access Hollywood\" tape in which Trump bragged about grabbing women sexually without asking permission had \"tremendous influence\" on the marketability of her story. Before the video was made public, \"there was very little if any interest\" in her claims, Davidson told jurors.\n\nAsked to describe the tape, which can't be shown in court, Davidson testified that it involved Trump and the show's then-host Billy Bush being recorded on a \"hot mic\" and \"some statements by both men that were troublesome.\"\n\nA deal was reached with the tabloid for Daniels story, but the Enquirer backed out. Though Pecker testified that he had agreed to serve as the Trump campaign's \"eyes and ears\" by helping to squelch unflattering rumors and claims about Trump and women, he drew the line with Daniels after paying out $180,000 to scoop up and sit on stories. Davidson began negotiating with Cohen directly, hiked up the price from $125,000 to $130,000, and reached a deal.\n\n\"In essence, Michael Cohen stepped into AMI's shoes,\" Davidson said.\n\nTrump's son Eric joined him Tuesday, the first time a family member has attended the criminal trial. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton walked into the courtroom with Trump and his entourage for the afternoon session.\n\nNation & World\n\nThe Latest | New York appeals court denies Trump's bid to halt the hush money trial\n\nAP\n\nThe GOP presidential hopeful is charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in connection with the hush money payments. The detailed evidence on business transactions and bank accounts is setting the stage for testimony from Cohen, who went to federal prison after pleading guilty in 2018 to campaign finance violations and other crimes.\n\nThe trial -- the first of Trump's four criminal cases to come before a jury -- is expected to last for another month or more. And with every moment Trump is in court, he's growing increasingly frustrated while the November election moves ever closer.\n\n\"This is a case that should have never been brought,\" he said.\n\nCourt will resume Thursday morning.\n\nPhotos: Scenes from Donald Trump's hush money trial",

It becomes a completely separate platform at that point. TikTok is just too good. It's too accessible to so many people. It's extremely accessible.\"\n\nRowray was joined by Suzy Loftus, head of trust and safety for U.S. data security at TikTok. TikTok users likely have seen videos of the former prosecutor and lawyer appearing regularly in their feed about how the Chinese-owned company is safeguarding American data.\n\nTikTok has roughly 170 million American users, or about half of the population of the United States. In Iowa, the company boasts 1.2 million users, including 39,000 Iowa businesses that use the social media app to grow their customer base.\n\nTuesday's discussion in Cedar Rapids comes roughly a week after Congress passed and President Joe Biden signed into law a measure that would force the social media platform's Chinese parent company to divest from its U.S. operations or face a nationwide ban.\n\n\"So we're going to different communities to sort of tell the story of how Americans are connecting with each other on TikTok,\" Loftus said. \" ... There's really great stories to tell here in Iowa about how people are using the platform.\"\n\nHinson: TikTok must cut ties with parent company\n\nTikTok's critics, which include Republican U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson of Marion, argue the app could put U.S. customer data at risk because Chinese law requires China's companies to share information with the government.\n\nTikTok maintains that it operates independently and protects U.S. data through a partnership with Texas-based tech company Oracle that allows U.S. user data to be stored on Oracle's cloud. Oracle acts as the data center for U.S. TikTok users.\n\nWhile TikTok is owned by ByteDance, Loftus said it is a global company with headquarters in Los Angeles and Singapore, 13 offices across the United States and almost 7,000 U.S. employees.\n\nShe noted three out of the company's five board of directors are U.S. citizens and 60 percent of its ownership is by global investors. Founders and employees each own about 20 percent, she said.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"So there are no ties with Communist China. Our ownership is largely by Americans and American investors,\" Loftus said.\n\nThe new law gives ByteDance nine months, or potentially up to a year, to find an approved buyer for TikTok. If it fails to do so, TikTok would be banned from U.S. app stores.\n\n\"If TikTok truly cared about supporting American businesses and entrepreneurs, they would cut ties with Communist China-controlled ByteDance,\" Hinson said in a statement. She co-led a bipartisan effort to force TikTok to divest from its parent company \"so Americans can use this app safely.\"\n\nTikTok is expected to argue that a forced sale could violate its users' free speech rights because a new owner could change the app's content policies and reshape what users are able to freely share.\n\nC.R. business owner: 'I would be devastated'\n\nRowray and other Iowa TikTok content creators said they are worried about the platform's future that has enabled them to grow their businesses and build communities.\n\nKahle Atherton-Boutte bought Prairie Patch Farm, her late uncle's 50-acre wildlife preserve located just outside Cedar Rapids, in 2018.\n\nAtherton-Boutte said she did all she could to continue her uncle's legacy. But after multiple failed attempts to promote the business, she turned to TikTok to show off the farm's charm and its 11 llamas.\n\nPrairie Patch Farm found quick and steady success and became a destination through TikTok videos of dressing up the llamas and showcasing the unusual experiences available at the farm. Now, with more than 166,000 followers, millions of likes and a budding global following, @prairiepatchfarm has evolved from a promotional account into feel-good content.\n\n\"TikTok has given me the opportunity to talk about nature preservation in Iowa and my small business on a global scale,\" Atherton-Boutte said.\n\nShe said about 30 percent of her customers are from TikTok.\n\n\"People are suffering more than ever under the crunch of inflation, depression, drug (and) alcohol use. And if one of my llamas can put a wig on and change somebody's day ... yeah, I mean, I think it's absolutely concerning,\" Atherton-Boutte said. \"And I agree with First Amendment (concerns).

And the judge's remarkable threat to jail a former president signaled that Trump's already precarious legal standing could further spiral depending on his behavior during the remainder of the trial.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nMerchan wrote that he is \"keenly aware of, and protective of,\" Trump's First Amendment rights, \"particularly given his candidacy for the office of President of the United States.\"\n\n\"It is critically important that defendant's legitimate free speech rights not be curtailed, that he be able to fully campaign for the office which he seeks and that he be able to respond and defend himself against political attacks,\" Merchan wrote.\n\nStill, he warned that the court would not tolerate \"willful violations of its lawful orders and that if necessary and appropriate under the circumstances, it will impose an incarceratory punishment.\"\n\nWith that statement, the judge drew nearer the specter of Trump becoming the first former president of the United States behind bars.\n\n\"This gag order is totally unconstitutional,\" Trump said as court adjourned after a day that included testimony from a Hollywood lawyer who negotiated two of the hush money deals at issue in the case. \"I'm the Republican candidate for president of the United States ... and I'm sitting in a courthouse all day long listening to this stuff.\"\n\nTrump is used to having constant access to his social media bullhorn to slam opponents and speak his mind. After he was banned from Twitter following the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol by his supporters, Trump launched his own platform, where his posts wouldn't be blocked or restricted. He has long tried to distance himself from controversial messages he's amplified to his millions of followers by insisting they're \"only retweets.\"\n\nBut he does have experience with gag orders, which were also imposed in his civil fraud trial. After he was found to have violated those orders, he paid more than $15,000 in fines.\n\nTuesday's ruling came at the start of the second week of testimony in the historic case, in which Manhattan prosecutors argue Trump and his associates took part in an illegal scheme to influence the 2016 presidential campaign by purchasing and then burying seamy stories. The payouts went to a doorman with a torrid yarn; ex-Playboy model Karen McDougal, who had accusations of an affair; and to porn performer Stormy Daniels, who alleged a sexual encounter with Trump. He has pleaded not guilty and says the stories are all fake.\n\nTrump was ordered to pay the gag-order fine by the close of business Friday, and he deleted, as ordered, the offending posts from his Truth Social account and campaign website Tuesday. The judge was also weighing other alleged gag-order violations by Trump and will hear arguments Thursday. He also announced that he will halt the trial on May 17 to allow Trump to attend his son Barron's high school graduation.\n\nOf the 10 posts, the one Merchan ruled was not a violation came on April 10, a post referring to witnesses Michael Cohen and Daniels as \"sleaze bags.\" Merchan said Trump's contention that he was responding to previous posts by Cohen \"is sufficient to give\" him pause on whether the post was a violation.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nMerchan cautioned that the gag order \"not be used as a sword instead of a shield by potential witnesses\" and that if people who are protected by the order, like Cohen, continue to attack Trump \"it becomes apparent\" they don't need the gag order's protection.\n\nCohen, Trump's former attorney, has said he will refrain from commenting about Trump until after he testifies at the trial. On Tuesday, he said in a text message to The Associated Press: \"The imposed fine is irrelevant. Judge Merchan's decision elucidates that this behavior will not be tolerated and that no one is above the law.\"\n\nIn other developments, testimony resumed Tuesday with a banker who helped Cohen open accounts, including one used to buy Daniels' silence. Trump's attorneys have suggested that they were engaged in an effort to protect his name and his family -- not to influence the outcome of the presidential election.\n\nJurors also began hearing from Keith Davidson, a lawyer who represented McDougal and Daniels in their negotiations with the National Enquirer and Cohen. He testified that he arranged a meeting at his Los Angeles office during the summer of 2016 to see whether the tabloid's parent company was interested in McDougal's story. At first they demurred, saying she \"lacked documentary evidence of the interaction,\" Davidson testified.\n\nBut the tabloid eventually bought the rights and Davidson testified that he understood it would never be published. Asked why the tabloid's parent company company, American Media Inc., would buy a story it didn't intend to run, Davidson said he was aware of two reasons.\n\n\"One explanation I was given is they were trying to build Karen into a brand and didn't want to diminish her brand,\" he said. \"And the second was an unspoken understanding that there was an affiliation between David Pecker and Donald Trump and that AMI wouldn't run this story, any story related to Karen, because it would hurt Donald Trump.\"\n\nAs for Daniels, the October 2016 leak of Trump's 2005 \"Access Hollywood\" tape in which Trump bragged about grabbing women sexually without asking permission had \"tremendous influence\" on the marketability of her story. Before the video was made public, \"there was very little if any interest\" in her claims, Davidson told jurors.\n\nAsked to describe the tape, which can't be shown in court, Davidson testified that it involved Trump and the show's then-host Billy Bush being recorded on a \"hot mic\" and \"some statements by both men that were troublesome.\"\n\nA deal was reached with the tabloid for Daniels story, but the Enquirer backed out. Though Pecker testified that he had agreed to serve as the Trump campaign's \"eyes and ears\" by helping to squelch unflattering rumors and claims about Trump and women, he drew the line with Daniels after paying out $180,000 to scoop up and sit on stories. Davidson began negotiating with Cohen directly, hiked up the price from $125,000 to $130,000, and reached a deal.\n\n\"In essence, Michael Cohen stepped into AMI's shoes,\" Davidson said.\n\nNation & World The Latest | Hush money trial enters 9th day, begins with gag order ruling and $9K fine for Trump AP\n\nTrump's son Eric joined him Tuesday, the first time a family member has attended the criminal trial. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton walked into the courtroom with Trump and his entourage for the afternoon session.\n\nThe GOP presidential hopeful is charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in connection with the hush money payments. The detailed evidence on business transactions and bank accounts is setting the stage for testimony from Cohen, who went to federal prison after pleading guilty in 2018 to campaign finance violations and other crimes.\n\nThe trial -- the first of Trump's four criminal cases to come before a jury -- is expected to last for another month or more. And with every moment Trump is in court, he's growing increasingly frustrated while the November election moves ever closer.\n\n\"This is a case that should have never been brought,\" he said.\n\nCourt will resume Thursday morning.\n\nPhotos: Scenes from Donald Trump's hush money trial Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0 Tags Dcc Wire Lee-national * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.",

        "text": "We praised Quest 3 as an excellent VR headset, but harshly criticized its \"barely passable\" mixed reality. But as with its previous standalone headsets, Meta has released a number of system software and developer tool updates in Quest 3's first six months on the market. Here's what they are, and how they change our verdict on whether you should buy it.\n\nMeta markets Quest 3 as the \"first mainstream mixed reality headset\". Given this, in our review we harshly criticized the lack of dynamic occlusion and the significant warping geometric distortion of the passthrough.\n\nIn December Meta released the Depth API allowing developers to add dynamic occlusion. However, it requires complex developer integration and is thus supported in almost no apps so far. Further, the depth map driving it is very low resolution, leading to pretty awful-looking results.\n\nThe passthrough was updated earlier this month with improved dynamic range and exposure control, making it easier to view physical screens like monitors and phones. The graininess was also slightly reduced. However, this all comes at the cost of a slightly darker and less vibrant looking image. Interestingly, this new passthrough tuning, including the darkness and vibrancy tradeoff, is closer to Apple Vision Pro's, as we noted in our review of it.\n\nMeta has also solved one of the complaints about passthrough in our review: that it didn't appear in all system interfaces and wasn't supported for loading screens. Apps can now use passthrough on their loading screen and Meta has added passthrough to system interfaces like the lock screen and power-off menu.\n\nThese changes may seem somewhat small, but together they allow you to remain in uninterupted passthrough from around five seconds after you put Quest 3 on until you take it off, making it feel more like a mixed reality headset and less like a VR headset with mixed reality poorly tacked on.\n\nMeta is also allowing some mixed reality apps to disable the VR-centric safety boundary, letting you use the full space around you, and since v62 the headset can remember multiple mixed reality rooms instead of needing to redo setup every time you move to a different room.\n\nQuest 3 was announced with a major feature coming post-launch, inside-out upper body tracking (IOBT).\n\nInside-Out Body Tracking (IOBT) uses Quest 3's side cameras, which face downward, to track your wrist, elbows, shoulder, and torso using advanced computer vision algorithms. It prevents the issues with inverse kinematics (IK) estimated arms, which are often incorrect and feel uncomfortable because the system is just making guesses from the location of your head and hands. When developers integrate IOBT, you'll see your arms and toro in their actual positions - not an estimate.\n\nIOBT shipped in December. However, four months later it's still only used by a tiny handful of standalone apps, including Swordsman VR, Drunkn Bar Fight, and XRWorkout.\n\nThe biggest use for IOBT currently is in Virtual Desktop, which uses it to emulate worn Vive Trackers to enable body tracked avatar movement in the PC VR version of VRChat.\n\nTwo of the key use cases of Apple Vision Pro, viewing panoramas and 3D \"spatial videos\" captured by your iPhone, are now easily doable on Quest 3.\n\nThis means you can view this content on a headset for one seventh the price of Apple Vision Pro. If you're the kind of person who captures a lot of photos and videos and deeply enjoys viewing them to look back at memories, it could even be a reason to buy a headset.\n\nWhen Quest 3 launched I was initially excited to use it on our weekly VR Download podcast but found its microphone had the same annoying plosives popping issue as Quest Pro, so I still use Quest 2.\n\nThe v62 update in February brought some improvements to Quest 3's microphone quality, including specifically to the plosives issue. However, I tested and found it still isn't good enough for VR Download, and still sounds noticeably worse than Quest 2.\n\nIn what may be an admission that the microphone hardware just isn't good enough, the v64 update earlier this month added the ability to use an external microphone on Quest 3 via the USB-C port. This can include a mic with a USB-C connector or any mic via a USB-C adapter.\n\nAt launch using SteamVR required using Meta's free (Air) Link feature or buying Guy Godin's Virtual Desktop. Air Link didn't support 120Hz refresh rate on Quest 3 and had inferior battery life to Virtual Desktop.\n\nMeta fixed both of these Link issues in the v62 update in February. But more notably, Valve released a free official Steam Link PC VR streaming app on the Quest Store, making it almost frictionless to connect directly to SteamVR.\n\nAt launch we noted that while Quest 3 was a greatly superior headset, Quest 2 still played all the same games for $200 less.\n\nThat gap increased to $300 in March when Quest 2 was cut to $200. But what's also changed is the first games that will run on Quest 3 but not Quest 2 have been announced.\n\nStarship Home will utilize the 3D scene mesh generated by Quest 3 during mixed reality room setup to position virtual objects on your walls and furniture.\n\nLast week Alien: Rogue Incursion was announced for Quest 3, PlayStation VR2, and PC VR. Survios hasn't said why it isn't set to launch on Quest 2, but it's likely the kind of game that previously wouldn't come to a standalone headset at all.\n\nQuest 3 is still an excellent VR headset, the headset that most people looking for a VR headset should buy. Its spatial video and panorama support even make it a good purchase for certain iPhone owners not interested in gaming or fitness.\n\nWhile Meta has made strides in polishing its mixed reality capabilities, it still suffers from the warping passthrough and rare dynamic occlusion, and thus we'd still describe its mixed reality as barely passable.\n\nWhile Quest 2 has dropped to $200, developers are starting to build around the capabilities of Quest 3's much more powerful GPU, and graphics updates for existing games have become a common occurance. And for gaming PC owners, Virtual Desktop's new runtime and the release of Steam Link has made wireless PC VR better and more convenient than ever on a standalone headset.",

        "text": "Rachel Winter, a partner at the wealth management firm Killik & Co, replies:\n\nIt sounds as though you've just started investing, in which case, congratulations. People often ask me when to begin and my answer is always: now!\n\nOne golden rule of investing is not to put too many eggs in the same basket. I would therefore invest most of your portfolio in the well-diversified global tracker fund and allocate smaller amounts to the three niche funds that focus on very specific areas. We love a bit of lingo in financial services, and we would call this a \"core and satellite\" approach. The global tracker fund would form the core of your portfolio, and the riskier satellite investments would sit alongside.\n\nInvesting little and often\n\nStock markets have historically generated great returns over long time periods, and I have confidence that they will continue to do that. However, predicting where they will go from one day to the next is pretty much impossible, so it's better to drip-feed money into the market gradually rather than attempt to get the timing spot on. Setting up a direct debit will save you from the chore of having to manually add money to your account and select new investments ad hoc, and it will also take the emotion out of the decision-making process.\n\n* How to pay less and make more money from your investments\n\nGlobal trackers\n\nIt's likely that your global tracker will be based on the MSCI World index or the FTSE All-World index. Both indices contain shares in well over 1,000 different companies, and these are spread across a range of sectors and countries. Importantly, both have recovered from every single crash they have experienced. Over the past decade the MSCI World index has generated an annualised return of 10 per cent.\n\nUK smaller companies\n\nUK companies have been out of favour with investors since the Brexit referendum, and smaller companies have been out of favour since interest rates started rising in 2022. The combination of these two things has made UK smaller companies one of the least popular asset classes around. The UK's Aim (alternative investment market) index -- often referred to as the junior stock market because it is where many fledgling companies are listed -- sits 40 per cent below its 2021 level. While it's easy to argue that UK smaller companies look cheap at the moment, it's difficult to predict if or when they will rebound. Their path for the foreseeable future is likely to be a rocky one and a hefty exposure to them is probably not for the fainthearted.\n\nAsian equities\n\nMost Asian equity funds are heavily weighted towards India and China. For much of the past two decades, these two emerging economies have been popular with investors due to their high growth rates. However, the Chinese economy has come off the boil thanks to its ballooning property debts and its tariff war with the West. Chinese equities have fallen back to their 2008 levels. India, meanwhile, is benefiting from China's problems, as western companies such as Apple are moving their manufacturing facilities from China to India. Asia is certainly home to many investing opportunities, but arguably it is too risky and uncertain to form the pillar of a portfolio.\n\n* How to make money from investment funds\n\nThe technology sector\n\nEveryone has been excited about artificial intelligence of late, and this has helped to drive the technology sector to record highs. Technology firms will clearly do well if AI becomes more mainstream, but a lot of this has already been priced in. What hasn't been talked about so much is how other sectors could benefit from using AI: healthcare companies could use it to lessen the sky-high cost of drug discovery; law firms could use it to summarise lengthy volumes of legal text rather than relying on armies of expensive paralegals; retailers could use it better to understand and serve their customers. The benefits of AI will spread far beyond the sector that created it, and your global tracker fund should reap the rewards.",

Fuelled by more hype than substance, the cute little Teenage Engineering designed gadget has been savaged in the press, particularly by MKBHD. As he says in his review, it has a low price, and an even lower battery life, requiring multiple charges a day. It also straight up lies to you about basic observations. Which is fine.\n\nBut as you can see in the video above, it turns out the device really could have just been an app after all. Android Authority managed to download and run the app on a regular Google Pixel 6A. And while it doesn't exactly work as well as it might on the real hardware, it still appears to run fine and even answer questions.\n\nAs we saw with the launch of Humane's Ai Pin, Rabbit's CEO is keen to play the victim after seeing negative reviews. Just like the crypto hype-beasts before them, the overpromising of AI has started to catch up to some of these founders.\n\nAnd begs the question: why not just state the facts in the first place? This isn't the first tech category to have a rough start, but the difference is Apple wasn't claiming the iPhone was a DSLR when it launched. Microsoft doesn't claim the Xbox is a supercomputer. Google didn't pretend that Gmail wasn't just a great web-based email client with a lot of storage for the time. I was definitely inspired by this tweet in this observation, but AI is definitely impressive.\n\nIt's just being given, in its current state, the same runway that crypto got in terms of potential. And in the meantime, serious issues like hallucinations and how such issues will be addressed are just dismissed.",

It is now my pleasure to introduce our CEO, Ben Gliklich.\n\nBenjamin Gliklich: Thank you, Varun, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining. Element Solutions' strong results for the first quarter reflect solid execution in recovering electronics markets. With a mixed overall macro environment in which our strength and increasing capabilities in fast-growing events packaging and data center markets, offset a mediocre market for smartphones and softness in Western automotive and general industrial supply chains. Our improving value proposition through investments in leading-edge semiconductor technologies and the impact of legacy pricing actions amidst deflation in certain commodities drove substantial profit growth. Constant currency adjusted EBITDA grew 17% year-on-year on the back of over 250 basis points of margin expansion. Our growth this quarter reflects the benefit of portfolio diversification and suggest the potential for further improvement as the electronics market recovery broad. Our focus on deep growing profit pools should continue to generate market outperformance and strong incremental margins. The Electronics business is recovering with a surge in semiconductor solutions, including advanced and wafer level packaging applications. Our volumes in that vertical grew in the high teens year-over-year, outpacing the market and our Circuitry Solutions business. Our more industrially-oriented circuit board assembly business declined slightly. The Industrial and Specialty segment saw a combination of softer automotive demand in the US. and Europe and lower revenue from metal price surcharges as certain commodities have deflated. Profitability in the segment increased significantly on lower raw material costs, ongoing strength in our offshore business and an improvement in our Graphics business. Our markets are roughly off to the start we expected and margins are driving our outperformance. Gross margins returned solidly north of 40% this quarter, an internal benchmark for us and should be stable at these levels borrowing metal price impacts. While many of our supply chains are normalizing after a period of heightened volatility and shortages, logistics prices remained elevated relative to 2019 levels. Notably, our margins in the first quarter have been achieved volumes well below where they had been in the past few years. While our cost of goods are mostly variable, margins have improved despite volume deleveraging. This further underscores the success of our investment in higher value, higher-margin applications and our ability to offset cost increases. The benefit of cost actions taken last year contributed to bottom line profitability as well. This has not come at the cost of growth capital. We continue to invest in strategic capabilities, semiconductor assembly or advanced packaging technologies, a research center in fast-growing EMEA and high-volume manufacturing capacity for our new Kuprion products. Throughout what has been a prolonged downturn in our electronics end markets, we've maintained and in certain instances, grown sales and technical resources needed to support customers as the market evolves and new technologies take root. Our commercial and innovation teams remain focused on delivering high-value solutions to solve customer pain points and high-growth applications. Our late-stage electronic sales pipeline in wafer level packaging and circuitry solutions grew meaningfully in the first quarter. This is in part due to the improved customer intimacy afforded by our highly successful ViaForm transaction, an investment we've made in improving our circuitry technical capabilities. We paid our first product milestone earnout payment for Kuprion this quarter and ActiveCopper opportunities are progressing rapidly. We're pleased with the outlook from our 2023 investments, but work remains on the operational steps necessary to maximize their long-term value. At the same time, our balance sheet is improving to the point where we can consider additional capital deployment aligned with our strategy. The year is off to a solid start and the outlook is positive. Carey will now take you through our first quarter business results in more detail. Carey?\n\nCarey Dorman: Thanks, Ben. Good morning, everyone. Continuing on Slide three where Ben just talked to some of the highlights. You can see a summary of our first quarter financial results. Organic sales grew 1% year-over-year and constant currency adjusted EBITDA grew 17%. These strong incremental margins reflect a substantial mix benefit from recovery in higher-margin semiconductor and Circuitry Business in Asia as well as lower raw material costs in industrial surface treatment and favorable mix in the overall I&S segment. In Q1 2023, the high-end smartphone supply chain and the memory disk markets experienced significantly reduced demand with inventory destocking that continued through much of that year. As we lap this period, we have seen memory disk recovery and growth in smartphone supporting circuitry solutions. Net sales in our Industrial and Specialty segment declined organically 3% at high levels of offshore energy activity and improving North America printer demand in graphics were offset by declines in our industrial surface treatment business. This quarter, total company net sales and adjusted EBITDA were both negatively impacted by strengthening US. dollar by roughly 2% and 4%, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved almost 300 basis points year-over-year in constant currency terms. The margin trend accelerated this quarter, improving sequentially 120 basis points from Q4 2023. Excluding the impact of the $79 million of pass-through metal sales and Assembly Solutions, our adjusted EBITDA margin would have been 26% in the first quarter. On Slide 4, we share additional detail on the drivers of organic net sales growth in our two segments. In Electronics, categories that saw significant destocking from last year, grew in the first quarter of 2024, a positive sign for more broad-based recovery as the year progresses. We saw consistent softness in our industrial-oriented businesses, particularly in the Americas and Europe, that impacted growth in both Industrial Solutions and our Assembly Business in electronics. In Assembly, soft industrial demand in Western markets drove a 2% decline in organic net sales. The circuit board assembly business has more exposure to industrial applications with certain capabilities focused on high reliability alloys required for demanding automotive electronics use cases. While year-over-year volumes in China and Asia were broadly were positive in the quarter, volumes declined in Americas and Europe. Circuitry Solutions sales improved 8% organically, with growth primarily coming from a recovery in our memory disk business. Inventories of our customers' finished products declined in 2023, and this market has picked up again in 2024 on the back of resumed investment in data storage for cloud computing enterprise servers. Our disk drives still represent the most affordable mechanism for data storage per bit and the near-term growth outlook is favorable. The first quarter showed other signs of market stabilization with overall smartphone units estimated to have grown at 8%. However, not all handset OEM supply chain experienced growth in the first quarter of 2024 with the bulk of the improvement occurring in China-based manufacturers. While we do skew towards the non-Chinese device makers, we have content across most smartphone models. Our customer base is broad, and our growth generally should correlate to overall industry units rather than any particular manufacturer over time. Customers globally are expecting an improved second half. Semiconductor Solutions led growth for the segment with organic net sales up 11%. We saw significant increases in wafer level packaging sales in Asia for both semi fabs and [ph]OSAT. We expect a continuation of this demand growth related to advanced packaging that supports memory, server and AI chip markets. Power Electronics products also continued to grow in the first quarter. as we successfully expand our Argomax centered silver technology to a broader customer base of electric vehicle manufacturers. Moving to Industrial & Specialty, organic net sales declined 3% year-over-year. Roughly half of the 6% decline in the Industrial Solutions vertical was driven by reductions in surcharges for commodity metals like palladium. While these price swings impact headline sales, the higher mix of value-add, high-margin recurring chemistry revenue benefits margins. Demand from automotive customers was sluggish, in line with global auto production in the first quarter. European construction and industrial end markets remain soft, with customers continuing to operate at reduced volumes. As we move through 2024, we expect a negative impact of commodity surcharge pricing to ease and new customer wins to benefit sales volume, particularly in the second half of the year. Graphic Solutions sales increased organically by 5%, reflecting improved demand primarily with flexible packaging customers in North America. Encouragingly, adjusted EBITDA margin in this business also showed a meaningful expansion of almost 300 basis points year-on-year. Energy Solutions remains a bright spot in the I&S portfolio with sales growth of 14% organically in the quarter as production and drilling activity remained strong. We expect this growth for energy business to continue this year. Slide five addresses cash flow and the balance sheet. We generated $39 million of free cash flow in Q1. The first quarter of the year has a typical uses of cash relative to annualized targets, including annual incentive payments and a semi-annual bond payment. We invested $28 million in our working capital, which primarily reflects the seasonal inventory build. CapEx in the quarter was $19 million, which is above the $50 million to $60 million annual run rate we expect for the year and reflects the late timing of certain growth projects and integration initiatives that were originally planned for the end of 2023. Now turning to the balance sheet, our net leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.3 times, inside of our long-range target ceiling of 3.5 times and once again demonstrating our ability to quickly de-lever with cash flow generation and earnings growth. Our capital structure remains fully fixed rate for the remainder of the year. We have no debt maturities until 2028. Through cross currency loss, the effective interest rate on our term loan is fixed at 3.2% as of March 31, and our liquidity position remains strong. With that, I will turn the call back to Ben.\n\nBenjamin Gliklich: Thank you, Carey. We've had a strong start to 2024 and are optimistic about the trajectory through here. Our investment in leading-edge and emerging technology is driving high incremental margin sets. While our markets are not uniformly improving, our conversations with customers and suppliers support a constructive view on more broad-based electronic demand improvement in the second half. There are reasons, however, for a level of conservatism this early in the year given geopolitical risk, sluggishness in Western industrial markets and modestly lower full year expectations from certain supply chain participants. For the second quarter of 2024, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $125 million or approximately flat ex currency on a sequential basis. We're also updating our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance range to $515 million to $530 million, which reflects 10% to 14% constant currency growth as the year-over-year FX headwind is now expected to be greater than $15 million. Were it not for the recent strengthening of the US. dollar, we would have increased the high end of the range as well. Overall, we're pleased with our execution to start 2024. Commercially, we're building a high-quality, high-probability pipeline of large leading-edge electronics opportunities and margin-enhancing industrial projects. Operationally, we're increasing volume manufacturing capacity for future growth areas, such as nano copper and power electronics, streamlining our legacy manufacturing footprint and building research and applications development in high-leverage geographies. We continue to make systems improvements and better leverage our data to increase the proportion of time our employees can spend on value-added technical service and product development. Taken together, this positions us towards delivering on our commitments for the year in the current demand environment and generating above-market growth to exceed them as the environment improves from here. To wrap up, I'd like to thank all of our stakeholders for their continued support of Element Solutions, in particular, a talented and dedicated people around the world working productively and collaboratively to support our customers and objectives. With that, operator, please open the lines for questions.\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Josh Spector from UBS. Your line is now open.\n\nJoshua Spector: Hi, guys. Good morning. If you could comment on your expectations here on what you're seeing on demand versus earlier because you talked about things kind of in line, but your first quarter came in better. Obviously, there's been some moving parts. So where things stand today? Do you have a more positive view on second half unchanged, worse, kind of go through where things are set?\n\nBenjamin Gliklich: Sure. So as we get closer to the second half, we have more conviction that a recovery is coming, and we're hearing that more from customers in the electronics side of the business. On balance, I think the rent in the back half is modestly slower than it was expected during the year, right? The semiconductor market, you hear industry participants who were talking about greater than 10% growth, now talking about, about 10% growth. But net-net, the electronics recovery is roughly what we would expect it to be entering the year. On the industrial side of the business, there's pockets of strength in air pockets. As we said in our prepared remarks, our markets are roughly playing out as we thought they would this year, and our outlook is unchanged from a demand perspective.\n\nJoshua Spector: Thanks. That's helpful. And I just wanted to kind of check on here where you recently talked about high single-digit percent growth in Electronics. Over the next five years, you delivered 4% growth in the first quarter. obviously, you expect things to improve a bit. When do you think you get to that run rate? And I don't know if there's a way to unpack how the next year, 1.5 years look from a cyclical improvement perspective versus how that framework impacts more of your secular growth view two to three years from now?\n\nBenjamin Gliklich: Sure. So in the first quarter, right, we had double-digit growth in semiconductor, high single-digit growth in Circuitry and the Assembly business lagged because it's more industrially oriented and the Western industrial economy was soft. By the end of this year, we should be on a year-on-year basis, getting up towards high single-digit growth, call it, mid- to high. And of course, EBITDA growth, and we talked about getting to double-digit EBITDA growth in electronics, we will be at that level in 2024. 2025, if we see a continuation of the electronics recovery, which is a reasonable expectation based on industry outlook should once again be double-digit EBITDA growth, and you'd expect that the electronics business should be in and around the same level of top line that we've been talking about. So that's a medium-term outlook, I would say. But I think it's reasonable to expect that we're about there for the next couple of years.\n\nJoshua Spector: Okay, thanks Ben.\n\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Roberts from Mizuho. Your line is now open.\n\nJohn Ezekiel Roberts: Thanks, and I'll just ask one here, but congrats on the progress on Kuprion. When do you think we'll see first sales? And could you scope the potential additional payments for us?\n\nBenjamin Gliklich: So we paid our first milestone payment for Kuprion this quarter. The background there is Kuprion was a technology we acquired last year with an upfront payment and a large performance-based earn-out structure. The first payment was based on product performance. So that was an internal performance milestone, and we were able to get the product to perform at a certain level, which generated this payment. The subsequent payments will be based on customer success. First, customer product qualification and subsequently customer base revenue. We're working very closely with several customers, and I would expect us to have product qualification payments this year and revenue to begin in 2024 and really ramp in 2025. The maximum we will pay for Kuprion, if we hit all of these targets, it would be about $275 million. That would be linked to about $115 million of revenue, which would be a low single-digit multiple of EBITDA based on the margins we're expecting from this business. We have 6 years to get to that ramp of revenue, but our internal expectation is we'll be able to do so well within that time frame. The customer reaction and pull from the market for this capability is stronger than we could have expected, and our progress against qualification is faster than we expected.\n\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bhavesh Lodaya from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\n\nBhavesh Lodaya: Hi, good morning, Ben. If I look at FY guide, it seems your outlook for the year is roughly unchanged, slightly better. I would have expected second quarter to be up sequentially just on some demand recovery, but also given some of the drivers you highlighted that impacted the first quarter EBITDA. You are building inventory as well. So maybe if you could comment on what you are seeing in your order books in the near term trying to get a sense of the full year guide versus the second quarter guide?\n\nBenjamin Gliklich: Sure. Our expectation for the second quarter, as you heard, was for sequentially flat EBITDA constant currency. And there's about a $2 million, $3 million FX headwind, which gets you to approximately $125 million. There is a modest demand ramp that is offset by some OpEx ramp that we see in the second quarter. And that's how you get to that flat sequential EBITDA. It is consistent demand environment. The industry expects the electronics market ramp to come in the second half. Typical seasonality supports electronics ramp in the second half. I think when you look at half-on-half performance sequentially, it's a slightly greater than normal seasonal uptick in terms of the percentage of earnings in the back half versus the first half. So we feel like it's a reasonable place for the second quarter. April is off to a good start, but we're not going to extrapolate from that. That's how we think about the phasing, and it's generally in line with what we thought entering the year as well.\n\nBhavesh Lodaya: Got it. And then the auto end market is clearly an important one for you. As it relates to your exposure, it appears consultant forecast for Western autos are gradually rising. However, at the same time, there are some concerns around softening EV adoption rates. Can you share your view on what you are seeing for your business?\n\nBenjamin Gliklich: So yes, auto is an important end market for us. Our outlook for auto markets is roughly sideways from where they are today. It's not just units that's impacting our industrial business, it's type of units. So some of the higher-end vehicles are struggling more than entry-level vehicles, and we have more content on the higher-end vehicles. The electric vehicle store is actually generally positive for us despite a softer electric vehicle market. We've seen our really unique capabilities in power inversion, getting much broader adoption in new OEM supply chains. So we've had some pretty compelling customer wins that will contribute modestly this year but significantly over the next several years. So by and large, we're excited about our capabilities in auto and our outlook for the businesses we have exposed to auto, albeit it's a weaker macro this year than ideal.\n\nOperator: Our next question comes from Christopher Parkinson from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\n\nHarris Fein: Great. Thanks. This is Harris Fein on for Chris. I guess from a high level, top line was flat and pass-through metals were neutral in the quarter, but margins were up a good amount year-on-year. So could you just maybe size the drivers of that just between mix, lower raw materials, the offset of the surcharge roll-offs? And I know you guided to some variable cost rebuild this year. I think you might have already mentioned. How much of that hit the P&L in the first quarter? Thanks.\n\nBenjamin Gliklich: Good thing, Harris. There's a lot of moving parts here. The simple answer is that the higher end electronics businesses we have that are really performing well are higher margin. And the businesses that are seeing macro weakness are benefiting from lapping lower raw material prices -- higher raw material prices and favorable mix from those surcharges that have rolled off. And so between the two of those things, right, we saw substantial margin uplift and there was a modest impact, I would say, from the cost actions we took last year, offsetting some of that variable cost rebuild. So those are the two moving pieces. Raw material deflation year-over-year was a low single-digit million-dollar impact, just to help you quantify what those pieces are. And what we said in our prepared remarks is margins are stably north of 40% on the gross profit line. And we see room for improvement in margin over time driven by divergent growth rates and the higher value proposition we're bringing to support high-end electronics customers. So we're far from our margin ceiling and should see progress from here.\n\nHarris Fein: Got it. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up in Circuitry, a lot of the debates with investors around smartphone, but that doesn't seem to be the primary driver of results right now. So just with demand recovery, I know you called out memory disk and server, just how are you thinking about normalized intermediate-term growth rates, what that looks like in that business?\n\nBenjamin Gliklich: Yes. So within our Circuitry business, there are really three moving pieces this quarter. Smartphone markets grew, Western industrial markets softened, and so our Circuitry business in Europe and the Americas was soft. Those two didn't quite offset, right? The Asian business is bigger. And so the smartphone uplift more than offset the softness in the West and then our memory disk business grew very nicely returned to growth. That memory disk business is for hard disk drives. As Carey said, they're still the lowest cost per bit storage alternative. And all of this activity in AI is driving incremental or disk drive demand. So those are the three moving pieces. The smartphone market, while it grew is still very dislocated from trend. And so we believe there's still incremental recovery there. At high margin and the memory disk market should continue to improve as well. So the Circuitry business should be a mid- to high single-digit grower from here for the foreseeable future.\n\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Byrne from Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). Your line is now open.\n\nRock Hoffman Blasko: Hi it's Rock Hoffman on for Steve Byrne. Just given the OpEx ramp in 2Q that you just mentioned, how do you think the near-term EBITDA margin might play out for the rest of the year kind of compared to what we saw in 1Q? And how much of a lever will mix benefits for the rest of the year?\n\nBenjamin Gliklich: Thanks for the question. So EBITDA margin should be stable around where they are right now in the second quarter, maybe modestly softer because of that OpEx ramp. But in the back half, they should continue to improve again, as we said, we are several points away from past peak EBITDA margin ex metal. I don't think we're going to get back there this year, but we've got room to drive that margin higher and multiple levers, right? We made comments about volume being down. And so we're still facing volume deleveraging in the business. And so we've got multiple levers for margin expansion from here and are confident we can drive that in the medium term.\n\nRock Hoffman Blasko: That's helpful. And just in semiconductor, specifically, was the strength in the business this quarter. I guess how much of that was kind of a result of a customer operating rates versus the mix gains that you guys saw?\n\nBenjamin Gliklich: Our semiconductor business rent because of customer operating rates because of customer wins. And that was organic volume growth, by and large, with a margin contribution from our ViaForm transaction last year.\n\nRock Hoffman Blasko: Helpful. Thank you\n\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Kapsch from Loop Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\n\nChristopher Kapsch: Good morning. So my question also on -- focused on EBITDA margins and more about the incremental margin is not about -- less about absolute margin levels. The strong EBITDA growth you had relative to a much more modest organic top line growth, the implication, as you referenced, like really robust incremental margin. So the question is, as the balance of this year plays out, like if you have continued growth in recovery in Electronics and potentially positive mix that comes with that and then hopefully some seasonal improvement across the broader portfolio. Is there a reason to think, other than the build back in OpEx? Is it that there'd be some reversion on incrementals? Or is there a case that incrementals are just simply structurally higher than you previously thought because of just both the overall mix of your portfolio and maybe some of the pricing entitlements that you've implemented?\n\nCarey Dorman: Thanks for that question, Chris. I think our view on incrementals are the conservatively 30% to 40% through the cycle. Obviously, this quarter was a bit idiosyncratic given a flattish organic performance and substantial organic EBITDA growth. We could see quarters like that in the future depending on mix and underlying demand. But I don't think we're going to say that structurally, incremental margins are changed from here. There is some conservatism in that 30% to 40% because some of our new technologies carry much, much higher margin than the core of the business. And as those ramp, they will improve. But I'm not sure we would draw a line in the sand and say that our view on incrementals have permanently changed after one quarter.\n\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Silver from CL King. Your line is now open.\n\nDavid Silver: Yeah hi. Good morning. I just have a couple of questions. I'll ask them both together, I guess. But as far as the ViaForm performance goes, I think this is the second consecutive quarter was kind of called out for its strength. And just wondering, is there any way to think about how much improvement you're thinking might be in 2024 over 2023? I know that the implication was when the deal was struck to repurchase the distribution rights that it was being purchased kind of at a below normal or below trend level of profitability? And then just along with that, is there anything -- or how would you say the business is being run with ESI, with your company in full control as opposed to the previous arrangement where another company was in charge of marketing and distribution?\n\nBenjamin Gliklich: Thanks for that question. We felt good about our timing for the ViaForm transaction. And we have benefited from the ramp in operating rates at customers over the past couple of quarters. Most of the growth we've seen has been driven by that. But the opportunity pipeline associated with it has grown and the applications window has grown as there's -- it is used in applications like hybrid bonding. So there's an opportunity for us with ViaForm to expand -- or it's an expanding addressable market. And by being in full control from soup to nuts of this product, we believe we're generating more commercial opportunities than we would have otherwise seen. And so this year, the business will grow double digits in line, slightly better than MSI. And the long-term outlook is for significant outperformance relative to MSI because of this growth in pipeline, share opportunities and growth in addressable market. It's a very compelling opportunity set for us. We're thrilled by that transaction.\n\nDavid Silver: Okay. Great. And then just one on the R&D spend. So the first quarter, the number is much higher year-over-year, but I do believe Carey mentioned last night that, that includes the progress payment related to Kuprion there. But my sense is your business is becoming structurally more R&D intensive. So is there kind of a target percentage of revenues or absolute total we should think about for adjusted or clean R&D spend, maybe for the balance of the year or going forward?\n\nBenjamin Gliklich: You're right to point out that the milestone payment for Kuprion was captured in R&D this quarter, which explains the large increase year-over-year. Our business invest R&D dollars not just captured on the R&D line in the P&L, but also in technical service and application development, which is captured under selling and technical service in the P&L. We do have and we have increased investment in technology, particularly at the leading-edge electronics nodes. But the breadth of our portfolio doesn't really make it apples-to-apples to compare our R&D spend as captured on the R&D line and the P&L to other electronics materials companies. I think that our target is to continue to invest aggressively where we have opportunities in support of our customers. And so R&D will grow roughly in line with sales, which should be growing nicely, maybe a little bit faster. But our business hasn't structurally changed in terms of its R&D needs going forward.\n\nCarey Dorman: And David, I would just add that some of the ramp we've seen in CapEx over the last couple of years has been to support -- a decent portion of that has been to support lab expansion, both applications lab and our core R&D labs as well as equipment to support that. So that's also R&D spend that we're investing, obviously, just showing up in the cash flow statement.\n\nDavid Silver: Okay. No, that's the, I appreciate the perspective there. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator: Next question comes from John Tanwanteng from CJS Securities. Your line is now open.\n\nJonathan Tanwanteng: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions and nice quarter. Just wanted to ask you about your semi business, AI has obviously been making headlines as well as the chips act and onshoring initiatives in other countries. Could you update us on how those things will flow through your semi business over the next one to three years? And how big it could become as a percentage of revenue? I know you gave some details on ViaForm, but if you could talk about the whole business, that would be great as a percent of profit as well.\n\nBenjamin Gliklich: Sure. Thanks for that question, John. So, our semi business has accelerated this year. It has a lot of runway to continue to grow and we expect it to outgrow the rest of our verticals and the rest of the electronics business. And so, it will grow as a percentage of sales. You're right to point out the chips act, the chips act is bringing significant investment into fab capacity in North America. We're seeing incremental fab capacity in Europe. And with ViaForm, which we just pointed out and other investments we've been making we feel like we're in a prime position to get more than our existing share where we play in these new fabs, which will grow -- which will drive above market growth here. Also with regard to the chips act, we have an opportunity that we're pursuing to receive some funding from the chips act for R&D, which is very exciting and should stimulate incremental growth in the business and opportunities in the business. The semiconductor business is 10-ish percent of our overall revenue. But given its divergent growth rate, it will increase as a percentage of the overall book of business and could conceivably be 20% of the business in the medium term. And we're investing aggressively behind that, but only in places where it fits our operating model where the profit pools are deep and where we've got a right to win. So, we are being circumspect about where we invest and where we choose to play. But we've got great capabilities and a lot of customer pull for them, which is compelling and exciting for us.\n\nJonathan Tanwanteng: Great, thank you. And then just in terms of the guidance and the underlying assumptions, what's the change in your expectations for China versus non-China handsets? And also ICE versus EV automotive, does that mix impact you as year progresses? Just help us understand your thoughts in those two areas.\n\nBenjamin Gliklich: So our business in smartphones skews towards non-Chinese OEMs, right? So we've got more value and share on non-Chinese device makers than local Chinese device makers, but we still have plenty of value in local Chinese smartphones. And so in a quarter like this past quarter where units were up maybe 8%, despite non-Chinese OEMs or Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) devices being down, we still group, our smartphone business. And so that's our baseline for the balance of the year. It doesn't have any big assumption associated with the OEMs providing the smartphones. It's just a smartphone growth driver. And with regard to ICE and EVs, that's a difficult thing for us to parse out because there are plenty of supply chains that we sell into that are EV or powertrain agnostic. And so I can't answer that question specifically, I would say that the general weakness relative to expectations in EV is something of a headwind but it hasn't changed our outlook for the full year.\n\nOperator: We don't have any questions at the moment. I'd now like to hand back over to Ben for closing remarks.\n\nBenjamin Gliklich: Great. Thank you very much. Thanks to everybody for joining, and we look forward to seeing many of you soon. Have a good day.\n\nOperator: We would like to thank everyone for attending today's conference call. We hope that you have a wonderful day. Thank you, and you may now disconnect with the session.",

        "text": "One of the biggest dilemmas in laptops for DJs and audio production overall is that there is usually some level of compromise when balancing performance with portability. Dell's XPS 15 9530 is an answer to that problem.\n\nIt's got the juice, a screen that's perfect for audio and creative work, and it's mobile enough to be convenient to take on the road or from session to session without feeling like you're lugging around a really expensive cinder block.\n\nDell XPS 15 9530 Overview Overall Average Rating: 4.4/5\n\nWhy I Like It:\n\nClean OLED display for visibility in dark environments Intel Core i7 processor and 16GB good tandem for audio production Portability for gigs\n\nWhat Could be Improved:\n\nGPU is a little underpowered USB-C ports only, but two are Thunderbolt 4\n\nSpecs:\n\nProcessor: Intel Core i7-13700H RAM: 32 GB Screen Size: 15.6 inches Graphics Processor: Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Laptop GPU Graphics Memory: 8 GB Weight: 4.2 lbs Operating System: Windows 11\n\nCompared to other top laptop models like the Microsoft Surface Pro 9 or Apple's MacBook Pro M3, the XPS more than holds its own.\n\nThe sleek design of Dell's XPS line makes them a go-to choice for audio production, video editing, and content creation, and the XPS 15 is no different.\n\nIt comes loaded with all of the specs that creating music calls for - processing power, the right amount of RAM, long battery life, soft-touch carbon fiber keyboard, dependable build quality, and screen space and resolution for even the most complex sessions.\n\nThe biggest feature holding the 15 9530 back is the limited port connectivity. Though it does sport dual Thunderbolt 4 connections, a USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 port, and SD card slot, if you want to use more traditional USB devices like audio interfaces and MIDI or DJ controllers you'll need to integrate adapters. Luckily, Dell includes a USB-C to USB-A adapter with it.\n\nLet's dive into some of the most useful specs of the Dell XPS 15 9530 with specific regard to audio production.\n\nBUY ON AMAZON Features & Benefits Processor (4/5)\n\nAsk anyone what the most important element of a computer is for working with digital audio and they'll almost always say a fast processor. Dell went with a middle-of-the-road but by no means inferior Intel Core i7-13700H with eight Efficient cores and six Performance cores for the CPU in this model.\n\nIt's a tried and true processor for digital audio that's fast enough for real-time processing like pitch correction and virtual instruments and can handle sessions with a high plugin count without the overkill of more advanced models that would drive the price of the computer up.\n\nRAM (4.5/5)\n\nAudio production is a very resource-intensive process. Just like a powerful and fast processor is one of the most important specs, RAM is right behind it. Having enough of it allows your machine to multitask by running all kinds of software like plugins and virtual instruments smoothly.\n\nRAM reduces load times and ensures that audio files are loaded from your drive and into your DAW without any hiccups. It's also critical for real-time processing so you can work in the moment smoothly and efficiently.\n\nThe 16GB of included RAM reduces latency and lag so creativity doesn't have to wait for your computer to catch up to the moment. And if you need more, you can always upgrade.\n\nDisplay (5/5)\n\nScreen size and display quality might not be the first features that come to mind when researching computers for DJ work or music production. But once you get those sessions going with plugins and automation lanes all over the place you'll soon find that screen real estate is at a premium.\n\nDell went with an edge-to-edge design has great display brightness and makes use of as much physical screen space as possible, and the 3200 x 1800 pixel resolution is as detailed as it gets compared to other laptops.\n\nA vibrant OLED touch screen adds some of the tactile feel back into the recording process, but if this feature is useful or not depends on each individual piece of software you're running. Still a nice option to have for purposes outside of recording, like gaming performance or video streaming.\n\nThe 15.6\" screen powered by a Nvidia GEFORCE RTX 4070 is a great compromise of space without making the laptop too bulky, so you get a great GPU while still being easy to use on the go. It doesn't have an HDMI port, but as mentioned an adapter is shipped with purchase.\n\nPortability (4/5)\n\nThe freedom that laptops provide to make music on the go, anywhere has always been one of their most appealing qualities. Dell's aren't known for being the sexiest laptops aesthetically, but the contoured design isn't bulky like some of their other models.\n\nThanks to the sturdy aluminum chassis it's not the lightest laptop on the market, but the powerful models always have some weight to them.\n\nAlternatives\n\nIt's one of the better off-the-shelf music production laptops, but the Dell XPS 15 9530 isn't the only player in the game. Whether you prefer the customization options Windows offers or the \"set it and forget it\" style of Apple, these are some of the best alternatives.\n\nDell XPS 15 9530 vs Samsung Galaxy Book4 Pro\n\nThe Galaxy Book4 Pro has the same Intel Core i7 processor and 16GB of RAM. At 2880 x 1800 the Galaxy's 14\" display isn't quite as good, but it is 3K and is also a touchscreen. It also has two Thunderbolt 4 ports, a USB-A 3.2, SD card reader, and a headphone jack.\n\nDell XPS 15 9530 vs Microsoft Surface Pro 9\n\nThe Microsoft Surface Pro 9 is a great budget-friendly alternative. It only has an i5 processor and 8GB of RAM, the screen size is smaller at 13\", and the hard drive storage space is only 256GB. It doesn't stand up to the power of the Dell 15 9530, but it's streamlined and even more portable at one of the best prices in the category.\n\nDell XPS 15 9530 vs Apple MacBook Pro M3\n\nIf power is what you're after - and price isn't a factor - this is by far one the best alternative premium laptops to the Windows operating system. The M3 processor is about as fast as it gets, and at 36GB of unified RAM, you'll never have to worry about adding more.\n\nAnd the Liquid Retina XDR display provides some of the highest resolution, picture quality, and color accuracy of anything on the market.\n\nConclusion\n\nEven with the modern laptop options for music production, it seems users always have to sacrifice a powerful laptop or one with a lot of mobility. The Dell XPS 15 9530 is an answer to that dilemma.\n\nThe fast, reliable Intel Core i7 processor keeps sessions flowing without a hitch, and the 16GB of RAM means you don't have to worry about being able to run large plugin counts or resource-heavy virtual instrument applications. And it's expandable if you need more.\n\nA large edge-to-edge OLED display gives you plenty of space to work with while keeping the machine as mobile as possible, and the battery life is ideal for DJs and music producers on the go.\n\nIf the lack of USB-A ports is an issue for integrating with your other gear, the Samsung Galaxy Book 4 Pro is a comparable option. It has two Thunderbolt 4 ports, a USB-A, is just as mobile friendly and comes in at a few hundred dollars less.\n\nThe 15 9530 is one of the best Dell XPS laptop models in the category and finds itself at the perfect intersection where strong performance meets portability. And it's one of the best laptops to use as a centerpiece for recording - if the lack of versatility in connection ports isn't a deal breaker for you.",

        "text": "(Reuters) - Apple supplier Skyworks Solutions forecast third-quarter revenue below Wall Street estimates on Tuesday on demand concerns, as clients struggle to offload excess inventory, sending its shares down 6% in extended trading. The chip company forecasts revenue of $900 million, plus or minus 2%, in the third quarter, below analysts' average estimate of $1.02 billion, according to LSEG data.\n\nIt expects adjusted earnings of $1.21 per share for the third quarter.\n\nThe company sees its \"mobile business to be down sequentially, below normal seasonal patterns, as excess inventory clears. In broad markets, we anticipate further modest growth as inventory levels appear to be normalizing in certain end markets\" in the third quarter, according to Skyworks' CFO Kris Sennesael. Skyworks gets most of its revenue from selling radio frequency and other chips used in smartphones made by Apple and Samsung Electronics, among others.\n\nGlobal smartphone shipments increased 7.8% to 289.4 million units during January-March, with Samsung, at 20.8% market share, clinching the top phonemaker spot from Apple, data from research firm IDC showed earlier in April.\n\nApple's smartphone shipments dropped about 10% in the first quarter of 2024, according to IDC. Skyworks' revenue for the quarter ended March 29 was $1.05 billion, in line with analyst estimates.\n\n(Reporting by Juby Babu in Mexico City; Editing by Alan Barona)",

        "text": "Marking the franchise's first transition from console to mobile, Ubisoft announces when iPhone owners can get their hands on Assassin's Creed: Mirage.\n\nHighlights\n\nAssassin's Creed: Mirage will be available on the Apple App Store for iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max on June 6. The game features cross-saves for seamless gameplay across devices. Ubisoft also has Assassin's Creed: Jade in development for mobile, promising more classic parkour action in ancient China, hinting at future exciting projects.\n\nUbisoft has just announced that Assassin's Creed: Mirage will arrive on the Apple App Store on June 6. Coming to the latest generation of iPhones and iPads, the release of Assassin's Creed: Mirage for iOS marks the first time that fans will be able to play through one of the franchise's major console titles on a mobile device.\n\nFirst announced at Apple's Wonderlust event in September 2023, Assassin's Creed: Mirage will be the latest AAA game to be released on the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, joining titles such as Resident Evil Village, the Resident Evil 4 remake, and Death Stranding. These ports of modern, high-end console games mark the next generation of mobile gaming, made possible by the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max's powerful A17 Pro chip and six cores, which enable native hardware-based ray tracing. While some of the other AAA tiles were available upon the iPhone 15's launch, Assassin's Creed: Mirage was delayed until this year.\n\nRelated Ubisoft Reveals Interesting Detail About Assassin's Creed Mirage Ubisoft clues fans in on a small, easily missable detail having to do with the loading screens in Assassin's Creed Mirage.\n\nUbisoft has just announced that Mirage will finally launch on the App Store for \"iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, iPad Air and iPad Pro with M1 chip or later\" on June 6, eight months after the game's release on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S. Set in 9th Century Baghdad, Assassin's Creed: Mirage returned the series to its roots with stealth and parkour-oriented gameplay. The iOS version of the game will feature cross-saves and cross-progression, as well as controller support, allowing Apple enthusiasts to pick up and play across their many devices. Fans can preorder the game on the App Store for $49.99, and Ubisoft has already confirmed it will feature multiple in-game cosmetic purchases. However, the developers have also recently revealed that Assassin's Creed: Mirage will not be getting any future DLC.\n\nClose\n\nMirage is Not the Only Assassin's Creed Game Coming to Mobiles\n\nWhile the iPhone 15 port of Assassin's Creed: Mirage marks a landmark for the franchise by bridging the gap between mobile and console gaming, it is hardly the first Assassin's Creed title for mobile. Ubisoft has released a number of both 3D and side-scrolling spin-offs over the years. Assassin's Creed: Jade, the latest of these mobile-only adventures, is currently under development and set to be released on both iOS and Android devices. Based in ancient China and featuring a fully customizable protagonist, Assassin's Creed Jade promises more of the series' classic parkour action, with the trailer teasing free-running on the Great Wall of China. However, as mobile phone technology becomes more powerful and cloud gaming more accessible, mobile-only entries may become less prevalent if studios instead have a feasible option of porting console releases of their games.\n\nBetween Mirage and Jade, mobile-gaming fans of the Assassin's Creed franchise have lots to look forward to. However, console gamers should certainly not feel left out, as Ubisoft's multiple mysterious projects promise to take players from the witch hunts of the Holy Roman Empire to the Samurai and ninjas of Feudal Japan. Fans can expect more details about these upcoming titles at the Ubisoft Forward on June 10.\n\nAssassin's Creed: Mirage $53 $60 Save $7\n\nAssassin's Creed: Mirage is the latest entry in Ubisoft's iconic stealth series.\n\nThe game will be set in 9th century Baghdad and is going to take the Assassin's Creed franchise back to its action-adventure roots with a more linear structure, rather than the role-playing style seen in the recent main series games.\n\nFranchise Assassin's Creed Platform(s) PC , PS4 , PS5 , Xbox One , Xbox Series X , Xbox Series S Released October 12, 2023 Developer(s) Ubisoft Bordeaux Publisher(s) Ubisoft How Long To Beat 12 Hours Metascore 78 See at Xbox Games Store See at Playstation Store $53 at Amazon",

        "text": "For those of us who love a good spy drama, the Apple TV+ series Tehran is simply one of the best that any of the major streamers has given us in recent years.\n\nBuilt largely around a Mossad hacker operating from inside Iran's capital city, this hit Apple drama is jam-packed with suspense, tight action scenes, and well-written storylines that keep you hooked from start to finish. Moreover, the show ratcheted up its quality big time from Season 1 to Season 2, which added Glenn Close to the cast and confined the main character exclusively to Tehran as she looked for a way to sneak back home.\n\nThere's no reason to think that Tehran Season 3, which added Hugh Laurie as a nuclear plant supervisor, will flag it all in terms of its quality and storytelling. However, it doesn't look like Season 3 will be coming to Apple devices anytime soon, according to a new report -- and the reason why shouldn't really be a surprise.\n\nThe new season is actually ready to go. However, according to the Israeli news website Ynet, Apple has forbidden Israeli public broadcaster Kan from airing it due to the ongoing war in Gaza. Not only that, but Apple appears to have also halted production on a fourth season of the show for the same reason.\n\nAnd it's not simply because of the mere existence of the conflict in Gaza, either. Tensions in the region are as fraught as they've been in years -- which is why, when you stop to consider that Season 1 of Tehran saw Israeli forces attempt to bomb an Iranian nuclear facility, you understand the implications of Ynet's sources saying that the new season's plot closely mirrors real-world events. Apple, for now, is waiting to see how things unfold before deciding when to bring Tehran back to Apple TV+ -- and, by extension, when Apple will allow the series to be broadcast in Israel.\n\nAccording to Ynet, its sources share that Apple believes \"the outbreak of a regional war would render the storyline of Israeli intelligence agents versus Iran irrelevant.\"\n\nFor now, there are two seasons of Tehran available to binge on Apple TV+. And, again, speaking as someone who watches a ton of spy and espionage thrillers, the show is one of the best originals Apple has released to date -- thanks, in no small part, to the cast led by the fantastic Niv Sultan, who plays Mossad agent Tamar Rabinyan.",

Lee Smith | ReutersThe Federal Trade Commission on Tuesday said it is challenging hundreds of alleged \"junk\" patents held by pharmaceutical companies for 20 brand-name drugs, including Novo Nordisk's blockbuster drugs Ozempic, Saxenda and Victoza.The FTC issued letters to 10 companies, warning them that certain drug patents were improperly listed. These companies include Novo Nordisk, AstraZeneca, Boehringer Ingelheim, Covis Pharma, GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis, Teva Pharmaceuticals and Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, as well as some of their subsidiaries. Many of the drug patents are for Type 2 diabetes, along with asthma and inhalers for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD. Most top-selling medications are protected by dozens of patents covering various ingredients, manufacturing processes, and intellectual property. Generic drugmakers can only launch cheaper versions of a branded drug if the patents have expired or are successfully challenged in court.\"By filing bogus patent listings, pharma companies block competition and inflate the cost of prescription drugs, forcing Americans to pay sky-high prices for medicines they rely on,\" FTC Chair Lina Khan said in a release. \"By challenging junk patent filings, the FTC is fighting these illegal tactics and making sure that Americans can get timely access to innovative and affordable versions of the medicines they need.\"The FTC also notified the Food and Drug Administration about the challenges. The FDA manages patent listings for approved drugs on a document called the Orange Book.The FTC first challenged dozens of branded drug patents last fall, leading three drugmakers to comply and delist their patents with the FDA. Five other companies did not. The Tuesday announcement expands the Biden administration's effort to crack down on alleged patent abuses by the pharmaceutical industry. The FTC has argued that drugmakers are needlessly listing dozens of extra patents for branded medications to keep their drug prices high and stall generic competitors from entering the U.S. market. The patent disputes add to a broader effort by the Biden administration to make health care more affordable for Americans - a key pillar of President Joe Biden's 2024 reelection campaign. \"We applaud the FTC's work with FDA to crack down on Big Pharma's patent games and lower costs for prescription drugs -- including weight loss and diabetes drugs,\" Jon Donenberg, National Economic Council deputy director, said in a statement to CNBC.Don't miss these exclusives from CNBC PROTuesday's biggest analyst calls: Nvidia, Tesla, Apple, Live Nation, Boeing, Coinbase, Amazon & moreDividend stocks are poised to outperform, says Bank of America.

        "text": "This article was originally published in German and has been automatically translated.\n\nApple's Vision Pro is currently suffering from a number of problems before it can become a mass market product for Apple. In addition to the fact that the hardware is still quite heavy and requires an external battery, the main problem is the price: Apple would like to charge 3,500 US dollars plus tax for its headset with two high-resolution 4K micro OLED screens, finger control and eye tracking. The market is therefore eager to find out when the company will present a second generation of the glasses, which will offer improved hardware and a more affordable price. However, if a report by the financial news agency Bloomberg from the weekend is correct, this could still take quite a while. Apple's roadmap currently states that the \"Vision Pro 2\" will not be released before 2026. But that is only half the truth.\n\nIt is also conceivable that Apple will continue to sell the Vision Pro as it currently is until 2026, but will launch a cheaper version meanwhile. In the rumor mill, this is currently going by the name \"Vision\" (without the \"Pro\") and is said to be significantly less sophisticated in terms of hardware. The problem: Apple is currently still trying to find a way to make the components cheaper - it's \"like hell\".\n\nApple's latest Vision Pro roadmap currently doesn't foresee a second-generation model until the end of the year after next, although the company is trying to find a way to bring a cheaper version to market by then, according to Bloomberg. This in turn could help competitors to upgrade. Meta, for example, has just announced that it will open up the operating system of its Quest models to other companies - a kind of Android approach. The current Meta Quest 3 is sold for 550 euros including tax, which is already significantly cheaper than the Vision Pro. More devices from competing providers based on the Meta platform will give Apple even more competition.\n\nHowever, a lot is likely to happen with the Vision Pro even before 2026. For example, visionOS 2.0 is due to be presented at the WWDC 2024 developer conference in June, which will add further functions. However, the new operating system is not a game changer, according to Bloomberg. More important is the expansion of availability to new regions. Apple has high hopes for the Chinese and European markets. The company could publish details on this as early as next Tuesday when a keynote is planned.\n\nIn terms of Vision Pro sales, however, there appear to be difficulties in the US home market - the only country in which the headset is currently available. Apple has reportedly scaled back its sales plans for the time being because demand is declining. The company is to purchase almost all 4K micro OLED screens on the market.",

        "text": "Conversational UX is undoubtedly shaping the future of user interaction, particularly as Gen Z becomes increasingly dominant in the market. The trend toward friendly and casual copywriting is evident among brands such as Figma, Spotify, SeatGeek, and even Apple. Among these, Spotify stands out for its emphasis on conversational branding, creating an inviting and approachable atmosphere around its brand. However, it's SeatGeek that truly captures my admiration for its exceptional implementation of conversational UX within its user interface, thanks to its design systems and guidelines.\n\nUnderstanding one's users and target audience is paramount for designers, and SeatGeek excels in this regard. With a focus on concert-goers, sports fans, and comedy show enthusiasts, SeatGeek is all about entertainment. What sets them apart is their deep understanding of their users' personalities, allowing them to integrate these insights into their UX and copywriting strategies.\n\nDelving into SeatGeek's branding guidelines reveals intriguing information about incorporating conversational UX through specific copywriting techniques. The core principles of SeatGeek's copywriting -- spirited, relatable, opinionated, and inviting -- serve as guides for achieving an approachable conversational tone. Let's look at each of these principles in more detail.\n\nStarting with spirited copywriting, SeatGeek infuses its messaging with energy and enthusiasm, creating an atmosphere of excitement and anticipation. By comparing the spirited tone to a more conventional approach, we can clearly see how it makes the brand more approachable and engaging. Spirited copywriting not only captures users' attention but also instills a sense of excitement and fun, improving the overall user experience and brand perception.\n\nMoving on to relatable copywriting, SeatGeek ensures that its messaging resonates with its diverse audience. By emphasizing common experiences and emotions shared by concert-goers, sports fans, and comedy enthusiasts, SeatGeek fosters a sense of connection and understanding. Relatable copywriting makes users feel understood and valued, strengthening their bond with the brand.\n\nNext, let's explore opinionated copywriting. SeatGeek doesn't shy away from expressing its unique perspective and expertise in the live events industry. By providing informed recommendations and insights, SeatGeek positions itself as a trusted advisor, guiding users toward the best event experiences. Opinionated copywriting adds depth and credibility to SeatGeek's brand identity, establishing it as a leading authority in its field.\n\nFinally, we come to inviting copywriting. SeatGeek creates a welcoming and inclusive atmosphere through its messaging, inviting users to explore and engage with its platform. By using language that is warm, friendly, and inviting, SeatGeek encourages users to feel comfortable and at ease, facilitating seamless interaction. Inviting copywriting sets the tone for a positive user experience, encouraging users to return and engage with the brand repeatedly.\n\nIncorporating these core principles of conversational UX into design and copywriting can significantly enhance the user experience and drive brand loyalty. As designers, it's essential to understand the power of language in shaping user perception and behavior. By adopting a conversational tone and incorporating these principles into our designs, we can create more meaningful and engaging experiences for our users.",

The Beats Solo 4 has an ultralight design, weighing just 217g (which is less than an iPhone 15 Pro Max, by the way), and UltraPlush cushions, a flex-grip headband, customizable sliders, and \"ergonomically angled ear cups\", the official press release says.\n\nThe Solo 4 features custom-built 40mm transducers that \"minimize electronic artifacts, latency, and distortion\", enabling \"extraordinary clarity and range\". It also supports Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking, and has upgraded beam-forming mics along with an intelligent noise-learning algorithm for high quality calls.\n\nPairing is seamless and one-touch on both iOS and Android, and the Solo 4 supports Find My or Find My Device on those respective mobile operating systems. On iOS you also get hands-free access to \"Hey Siri\" and Audio Sharing.\n\nThe Solo 4 have both a USB-C port (with support for USB-C audio and simultaneous charging) and a 3.5 mm analog input for battery-free wired playback. The b button lets you take calls or activate your voice assistant, and to control volume you press above or below it.\n\nBattery life is promised to be up to 50 hours on one charge, and with Fast Fuel you get up to 5 hours of playback from a 10-minute charge.\n\nBeats Solo 4 in Matte Black, Slate Blue, Cloud Pink\n\nThe Beats Solo 4 are available to order today in Matte Black, Slate Blue, and Cloud Pink for $199.99. Shipping starts on May 2.\n\nThese earbuds pack \"big Beats sound in the smallest case\" the brand has ever made. They come with \"ergonomically designed acoustic nozzles and laser-cut vents\" to improve audio performance while relieving pressure. Four eartip sizes are in the box (XS, S, M, L).\n\nEach earbud has dual-layer transducers \"designed to minimize micro-distortions across the frequency curve\", for high-fidelity sound \"with uncompromising clarity and detail\". Each bud has a custom-designed mic with an advanced noise-learning algorithm.\n\nLike the Solo 4, you can quickly and seamlessly pair these with both iOS and Android devices, and they also support Apple's Find My and Google's Find My Device networks.\n\nThe b button is once again the main control here, with single-tap and long-press supported. These can be configured in iOS Settings or the Beats app. The Beats Solo Buds come with up to 18 hours of playback on one charge, and with Fast Fuel, you get an extra hour from a 5-minute charge.\n\nBeats Solo Buds in Arctic Purple, Transparent Red, Matte Black, Storm Gray\n\nThe Solo Buds will be available in June in Matte Black, Storm Gray, Arctic Purple, and Transparent Red for $79.99.",

It was unclear at press time if that early encampment would remain after organizers announced police had asked them to clear the area.\n\nAn unknown number of people are expected to come together on the Lawn Wednesday to \"call for and END to the occupation and an end to our institutions' complicity in genocide,\" according to an Instagram post from UVA Dissenters, one of the organizing groups. The organization describes itself as \"a collective of anti-imperialist organizers working to turn the tide against endless war.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

Organizers chose the date to align with an anti-war protest that took place on the Lawn in 1970, when thousands of students held demonstrations to voice their opposition to the United States' decision to expand the Vietnam War into Cambodia.\n\nThe weeklong protests are remembered as May Days: Classes were canceled, protesters occupied the Naval ROTC building (now John Warner Hall) and police stormed the Lawn, jailing dozens.\n\nThe UVA Dissenters Instagram post specifically highlights that time on Grounds as an inspiration for its current plans.\n\n\"During the 'May Days' strike of 1970, UVA students announced a 'Freedom Day' to rally students together in their opposition to the U.S. imperialist war in Vietnam,\" the post reads.\n\nWhile that 1970 episode took place over the course of several days, Wednesday's demonstration is planned to be a daylong event, according to organizers. It does not say whether protesters plan to remain on the Lawn beyond Wednesday.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe demonstration comes on the heels of protests that have erupted at universities across the country, including in Virginia. Protesters have been arrested at encampments and \"liberated zones\" at the University of Mary Washington, Virginia Tech and Virginia Commonwealth University in the past week. In the latter case, police in riot gear deployed pepper spray and clashed with protesters before the crowd was dispersed; roughly a dozen people were arrested.\n\nThat was on Monday, just one day after Gov. Glenn Youngkin said that protests at public colleges in the commonwealth must remain peaceful, or face the consequences.\n\n\"We will protect the ability to peacefully express yourself, but we're not going to have the kinds of hate speech and intimidation that we're seeing across the country in Virginia,\" he said in a statement.\n\nAs with so many other colleges where protests have taken place, UVa students are demanding that the university divest itself from all financial ties to Israel, which has been locked in a monthslong war with Palestinian terrorist group Hamas that has killed more than 34,000 since Hamas' surprise attack on Oct. 7 of last year.\n\nOn Tuesday, Republican Rep. Bob Good, who represents UVa and the surrounding 5th District in Congress, wrote a letter to UVa President Jim Ryan.\n\n\"I urge you to demonstrate courageous and decisive leadership and take appropriate action to protect Jewish students and faculty by upholding Title Viand eliminating any visible demonstrations of antisemitism at UVA,\" Good wrote.\n\nThe Daily Progress reached out to both UVa officials and the Virginia State Police regarding their own plans for Wednesday, but did not hear back before press time.\n\nUVa Final Exercises are planned to take place the weekend of May 18 this year. At colleges nationwide there is concern that the ongoing protests will interfere or cancel graduation plans.",

There's only so much space I have in my pocket and bag, and a case is already adding a good amount of thickness.\n\n0:41 Related This budget, waterproof Anker speaker is my perfect audio companion At under $40, Soundcore's original Bluetooth speaker delivers clear audio come rain or shine -- and even in the shower.\n\nThe Anker 622 Magnetic Battery, luckily, does the work of both a stand and a charger, while managing to be less than an inch thick. Maybe you've seen it on your social media feeds, or maybe like me, you're always looking for a better charger to keep in your bag when you travel, but based on my time with the charger, the Anker Magnetic Battery could very well do the trick for a lot of people. Here's how it works, as both a charger and a stand, and whether you should consider attaching it to the back of your phone.\n\nAnker Magnetic Battery\n\nRecommended\n\n$50 $70 Save $20 Pros Less than an inch thick 5,000 mAh battery USB-C port lets you charge anything over a cable Cons Stand only folds to one angle $50 at Anker $50 at Amazon\n\nPrice, availability, and specs\n\nThe Anker 622 Magnetic Battery Pack currently costs $49.99 and comes in black, white (Dolomite White), green (Buds Green), purple (Lilac Purple), and blue (Misty Blue) varieties. Regardless of what color you pick, the external battery pack ships with a USB-C to USB-C cable for charging the battery itself, and other devices if you so desire.\n\nAt only 5,000mAh, the battery isn't the largest -- Anker's own 633 Magnetic Battery has a 10,000mAh capacity -- but it's plenty for keeping your phone powered long enough to get home after a long day of travel, or charge a little over 50%. The fact that the battery is only about 0.5-inches thin probably contributes to that limited charging ability, but it's also what makes it something you might consider keeping on your phone long-term.\n\nAs a charger\n\nSlow but still useful\n\nThe Anker Magnetic Battery is decidedly middle-of-the-road as a charger. Charging speeds max out at 7.5W, and some combination of charging speed, battery capacity, and general chemistry mean that your phone and charger will consistently get warm while wirelessly charging. Not enough to overheat anything, but enough to make it noticeable while holding your phone with the battery attached.\n\nThe Anker Magnetic Battery is decidedly middle-of-the-road as a charger.\n\nStarting from when my phone dropped to 20% battery (typically when switching on Low Power Mode is prompted), I was able to slap on the Magnetic Battery and get back to 90% in around three hours. Recharging the battery back itself takes about two and a half hours using a 30W charging brick and the USB-C cable that came with the battery pack. You can also check how full the battery pack is by looking at the five white LED lights that act as a status indicator for the battery.\n\nClose\n\nSince Anker included a USB-C port on the side of the Magnetic Battery, using it to charge other things that don't have wireless charging is very easy. Insert the appropriate cable, press the button on the side to make sure there's still charge in the battery, and then plug it in to whatever you need to power. Wired connections take priority over wireless ones, so you won't be able to charge two devices at once, but it's certainly helpful to have another way to use the external battery.\n\nAs a stand\n\nLimited options\n\nDo you want a stand that can only be set at one angle? With the Anker Magnetic Battery, that's all you'll get. Despite looking like it might be completely adjustable, the battery pack has one setting: a 45-degree angle that's great for watching video, but not always the best for video calls. Sometimes you want your phone to be a little more vertical, especially if you're already propping it up closer to eye-level. You don't get that option on Anker's external battery.\n\nThe thin and soft origami-style fabric that makes up the stand is sturdy enough to support a phone, but not sturdy enough to not accidentally knock over if you're not careful.\n\nThe thin and soft origami-style fabric that makes up the stand is sturdy enough to support a phone, but not sturdy enough to not accidentally knock over if you're not careful. Peeling the back cover down to fold it into shape is also way harder than it should be. It's the one thing about the battery pack that feels slightly less premium, which is unfortunate since it's also one of the main selling points of the product.\n\nRelated Nomad's Qi2 Wireless Charging Stand is the prefect introduction to wireless charging An elegant 15W wireless charging stand for more than just Apple devices. What's the catch?\n\nThese are ultimately quibbles, because it does the job of propping up your phone at a good angle 90% of the time, I just felt like an even better option was so easily in reach with a few more magnets and better weight distribution.\n\nVerdict: Is this external battery worth the extra weight?\n\nPocket-lint approved\n\nAmid the onslaught of products that get recommended, infomercial-style, on social video feeds, it's hard to go wrong with an external battery pack. Limitations on battery capacity and viewing angles aside, the Anker Magnetic Battery is a fantastic option, especially at only $50.\n\nIt's stylish enough to not be an eyesore on your phone, and capable enough to save you when it matters, and you need a charged phone most.\n\nIt's stylish enough to not be an eyesore on your phone, and capable enough to save you when it matters, and you need a charged phone most. That's all you can really ask for out of an external battery pack and the virality online is more than earned at this point. It's a great external battery for most people.\n\nRelated Best portable charger for iPhones: Beat your low battery Every iPhone user knows the anxiety of a low battery notification, so a portable charger is the quick solution you need.",

        "text": "Apple is set to introduce significant updates to Safari with the upcoming releases of iOS 18 and macOS 15 later this year. Among the new features, according to a recent report, is an AI-powered tool named \"Intelligent Search.\" This tool will offer capabilities such as page summarization, allowing users to quickly grasp the main points of web content without reading through everything. Additionally, a \"Web Eraser\" feature is also about to debut, which could provide users with enhanced privacy controls or content management options on web pages. These updates indicate Apple's commitment to integrating more advanced technology into its browser, enhancing both functionality and user experience.\n\nNew iOS 18 Features for Safari\n\nThe report from Marko Zivkovic at Apple Insider, which outlines the potential updates to Safari, notes that the \"exact implementation\" of these new features \"remains fuzzy.\" This suggests that while the features are in development, their final form and functionality are not yet final. Given this uncertainty, it would be wise to view these claims with some skepticism until more concrete information is available or until Apple provides official confirmation and details about the updates.\n\nAccording to Marko Zivkovic's report, Apple is planning a redesign of the controls menu in Safari's address bar. This new design aims to consolidate both existing and new page control tools into a central location, making them more accessible and easier to use. One of the notable additions to this new menu is a feature they call \"Intelligent Search according to reports.\" This tool is going to enhance the browser's search capabilities, possibly by integrating advanced AI technologies to improve how users find and interact with information on the web. The specifics of how \"Intelligent Search\" will function are still not out, but its inclusion suggests a move towards a smarter, more user-friendly browsing experience.\n\nThe \"Intelligent Search\" feature, a part of the upcoming Safari 18, is off by default in the test builds but users can activate it from the new menu in the address bar. After enabling, this tool will be able to identify key topics and phrases within a webpage and subsequently generate a summary of its contents. This functionality aims to simplify the process of absorbing information quickly, making it especially useful for users browsing extensive or complex content.\n\nAvailability of the New Safari Browser Features\n\nThe report suggests that Apple's goal is to integrate text summarization into Safari 18 later this year, enhancing the browser's utility as a research and reading tool. However, as previously mentioned, the specifics about how this feature will work remain unclear, and the exact details of its implementation are still under development. This \"fuzzy\" status indicates that while the feature is a promising addition, its final form might still be subject to changes as it goes through further testing and refinement.\n\nGizchina News of the week Join GizChina on Telegram\n\nArc, developed by The Browser Company, is another example of how AI technologies are integrating into web browsers, including features like page summarization. This trend highlights the growing focus on enhancing user experience through smart tools that simplify online interactions.\n\nRead Also: The Future of iPhone Security: iOS 18 AI Takes the Lead\n\nSimilarly, the upcoming Safari 18, set to come with the iOS 18 and macOS 15, may also adopt new AI-powered features. One such feature is the \"Web Eraser.\" According to marko zivkovic, this tool will give users the ability to selectively remove or erase specific portions of web pages. This in particular will be useful for decluttering pages, focusing on specific content, or managing how information displays on the screen based on user preferences. The \"Web Eraser\" could significantly enhance the customization capabilities of Safari, making it a more versatile tool for personal web browsing.\n\nTake Control of your Web Browsing\n\nThe \"Web Eraser\" feature in the upcoming Safari 18 promises to offer users a more refined control over their web browsing experience by allowing them to selectively remove elements such as ads, images, and other content from webpages. This functionality mirrors what some third-party ad blockers already provide, but Apple's first-party implementation in iOS 18 and macOS 15 could offer a more seamless and integrated experience.\n\nA notable aspect of the \"Web Eraser\" is its ability to remember the user's modifications to a webpage for future visits. According to Marko Zivkovic, once a user makes changes to a webpage using this feature, Safari will retain these changes and reapply them every time the user revisits that page, even if they close the original tab or window. This persistence enhances user convenience, ensuring that their browsing experience remains consistent across sessions, tailored to their specific preferences and needs. This could significantly improve the usability and appeal of Safari as a browser that truly adapts to the individual's browsing habits and requirements.\n\nWhen a user returns to a webpage where they've previously used the \"Web Eraser\" feature to modify content, Safari will alert them that changes have been made to the page according to their preferences. This notification ensures users are aware that the content they are seeing is not the original version but has been customized based on their earlier interactions. Additionally, Safari will provide an option to undo these modifications, allowing users to restore the webpage to its original, unaltered state if they choose. This functionality not only enhances user control over their browsing experience but also adds a layer of flexibility, enabling users to easily switch between modified and original content views depending on their current needs or preferences.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, Apple's upcoming Safari update in iOS 18 and macOS 15 promises exciting advancements with AI-powered features like \"Intelligent Search\" for page summarization and \"Web Eraser\" for content control. While details remain under development, these additions suggest a focus on enhanced user experience, making Safari a smarter and more personalized browsing tool.\n\nDisclaimer: We may be compensated by some of the companies whose products we talk about, but our articles and reviews are always our honest opinions.

Upside is especially warranted with the iPhone 16 scheduled to release this year:\n\n\"It's somewhat incredulous to me that such a large cap stock could have such a defined seasonal pattern, but in 15 of the last 17 years Apple's outperformed in the three months before an iPhone launch and by an average of about 13% outperformance,\" Sacconaghi told the outlet.",

        "text": "Drew Barrymore, left, and Dua Lipa participate in a conversation about \"Radical Optimism\" on Friday, April 26, 2024, at Talent Unlimited High School in New York.\n\nDua Lipa is floating in the ocean, the sun just beginning to set behind her. She looks strong, serene -- save for the looming threat of a massive shark, fin just breaching the surface a few feet away.\n\nThe image is the cover of her third album, \"Radical Optimism,\" out Friday. It is an apt visual representation for an album about finding and protecting your peace in dangerous waters -- a thematic maturation for the Grammy-award winning pop superstar, who has long identified her sound as \"dance-crying.\"\n\nThat cheeky term encapsulates the clubby jubilance of her biggest pop hits, but \"Radical Optimism,\" with its psychedelic electro-pop, complicates it.\n\n\"There's definitely something more cathartic that comes with the third album,\" she told The Associated Press recently.\n\n\"'Future Nostalgia' was my chance for me to be able to do a very polished pop-dance-disco record,\" she says of her 2020 sophomore release. \"Radical Optimism,\" alternatively, was informed by what she's learned from touring the world over the last few years -- drawing influence from trip hop and Britpop and including newfound interest in live instrumentation.\n\n\"It was so much more free flowing,\" she says of her latest album's creative process. \"And it didn't have a formula, per se, but I always had that pop sensibility in the back of my mind. But I wanted to just experiment and try and create something new. But I think this was always kind of the album that I've always wanted to make.\"\n\nIn more ways than one: Around her first album, Lipa wrote down that she'd like to work with Tame Impala's Kevin Parker -- specifically on her third album. The manifestation worked, and he became a crucial collaborator on \"Radical Optimism.\"\n\n\"It was almost like something deep down, instinctively, was telling me that it was something earned,\" she says. \"That over time I would be able to go in and work with a creative that I was so inspired by, and to be in a room and learn from him.\"\n\nAs for the album's title: \"It's euphoric, it's togetherness,\" she says.\n\n\"Dance music has such a long history of creating such a safe space. And I just want to embody that,\" she adds.\n\nShe's been working hard to get there. Lipa, now 28, began her career at age 15, when she convinced her family to let her move from Kosovo to London, where she was born, to pursue a pop career. She went to school, modeled, and in 2017 released her eponymous debut album with the blockbuster dance-pop hits \"New Rules\" and \"One Kiss.\" Then came the nu-disco electropop of 2020's \"Future Nostalgia,\" which solidified her status as one of pop music's biggest players. Not bad for a unique voice in the streaming era, where capturing the attention of the masses -- and sustaining it -- has never been more of a challenge.\n\nIn 2024, her pop songs contain a kind of learned elasticity. The melodies stack atop unusual synth sounds, the vocal range stretches (particularly on the cut \"Falling Forever\"), the dance breaks inspired by U.K. rave culture and format-benders Primal Scream and Massive Attack -- they're all elements Lipa says she wouldn't have dared attempt on her last album. That came from working with Parker, producer Danny L Harle, songwriter Tobias Jesso Jr. (known for his work with Harry Styles and Adele), and Lipa's longtime collaborator Caroline Ailin.\n\n\"She understands how to handle a lot of opinions in the room, including her own,\" Jesso tells the AP. \"She doesn't value hers above anyone else's, she simply uses the ones which work best for what she is trying to achieve.\"\n\n\"We were a band,\" Lipa says of the group. The first day they wrote \"Illusion.\" The second day, \"Happy for You.\" (\"I'd never written a song like that before,\" she points out. \"And I loved that version of myself.\") The third day, the post-disco pop of \"Whatcha Doing.\" In bright, airy studios in London and Malibu, they finessed what would become Lipa's most ambitious -- and euphoric-sounding -- record to date.\n\nThat experimentation appears across Lipa's endeavors, too. She's acting more -- \"little baby roles!\" she says with a smile -- after playing Mermaid Barbie in the blockbuster \"Barbie\" (she also contributed the ubiquitous, Grammy-nominated song \"Dance the Night\" to the soundtrack) and LaGrange, a sultry spy in \"Argylle\" (a brief performance AP film critic Jake Coyle described as the movie's best few minutes).\n\nIn 2022, she founded a newsletter called Service95, what she views as an extension of a childhood blog, to \"tell stories from all around the world, not solely from a Western lens,\" she says. It has grown into a website, podcast and book club: \"It's just another hobby of mine that I've somehow managed to turn into a job, which is just great,\" she says, smiling.\n\n\"My day job, which is my music career, which I love, comes with constantly being online. And I think for me, at least now I'm searching for other things, and not doomscrolling on Twitter,\" she says of her media enterprise. \"At least this way I'm like learning something new about the world. I love having that kind of duality in my life.\"\n\nIt's a duality fueled by curiosity, like when Lipa made headlines late last year for challenging Apple CEO Tim Cook in an interview on her podcast over reports of children in the Democratic Republic of Congo mining cobalt for iPhones.\n\n\"That was scary, and really exciting,\" she says. \"You never really know what to expect when you go in to interview someone.\"\n\nA few days after visiting the AP's New York headquarters, Lipa appears at a public high school on the Upper East Side of Manhattan to speak to students in a conversation moderated by Drew Barrymore.\n\n\"One of the things I admire about her is how incredibly intelligent she is,\" Barrymore says in her introduction, commending Lipa for not only being an \"icon,\" but someone who is \"globally aware.\"",

        "text": "A federal judge has ruled that some of North Carolina government's restrictions on dispensing abortion pills -- such as requiring that only doctors provide the drug -- are unlawful\n\nRALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Some of North Carolina government's restrictions on dispensing abortion pills -- such as requiring that only doctors provide the drug -- are unlawful because they frustrate the goal of Congress to use regulators to ensure the drug is distributed safely, a federal judge ruled on Tuesday.\n\nU.S. District Judge Catherine Eagles in Greensboro granted a partial victory to a physician who performs abortions and last year sued state and local prosecutors and state health and medical officials.\n\nOther restrictions on the drug mifepristone that were challenged, however, such as requiring an in-person consultation 72 hours in advance and an in-person examination before a prescription, are not preempted, Eagles wrote. That is because they have not been expressly reviewed and rejected by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or because they focus more on the practice of medicine and potential pregnancy-related health issues, she added.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nRepublican legislative leaders who joined the lawsuit to defend the restrictions argued the FDA hadn't received specific powers to set regulations on abortion drugs across the nation. While Eagles agreed, she added there was nothing to indicate that Congress had given the FDA less authority to regulate the use and distribution of mifepristone compared to any other drug upon which it had power to alter and reduce restrictions if found to be safe.\n\nSome of North Carolina's restrictions that remain on the books already had been removed by federal regulators as unnecessary, she wrote, including that the drug be prescribed only by a physician and dispensed in person.\n\nSpokespeople for plaintiff Dr. Amy Bryant, GOP legislative leaders and Attorney General Josh Stein didn't immediately respond Tuesday to emails seeking comment. The ruling could be appealed.\n\nThe FDA approved mifepristone in 2000 to end pregnancy, when used in combination with a second drug, misoprostol. The pills are now used in more than half of all abortions in the U.S.\n\nStein, a Democrat and abortion-rights supporter, didn't defend the additional restrictions in court because Stein's office believes they were preempted by the FDA.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

        "text": "HBO's \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" has officially come to an end with an acclaimed farewell season that ended just the way it began, with numerous references to creator and star Larry David's NBC hit sitcom \"Seinfeld\" in its series finale. Over the course of its 12 seasons, \"Curb\" has remained a constant with its run at the Emmy Awards - a rarity for a show that has aired that long, especially within a timespan of 24 years and almost a quarter of a century - having an impressive total of 51 nominations and two wins thus far. Now in its final hurrah, it has one more shot at Emmy gold; will it be able to triumph at the upcoming 2024 ceremony one last time? Let's examine some of the categories it has been recognized in past seasons to determine what kind of haul it might receive.\n\nBeginning with Best Comedy Series, \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" has garnered an outstanding 10 nominations in the top category, receiving a bid for every season since the second. It also holds the distinction for being the most nominated comedy series without a win, surpassing another HBO comedy, \"The Larry Sanders Show,\" at six. Even when the semi-improvisational series has missed in other major categories for past seasons, its inclusion for Best Comedy Series was always secured. With the series finale sticking the landing for viewers and the absence of five out of the eight Best Comedy Series nominees from last year, the show is looking good for a record-extending 11th bid in this category. It's currently in fifth place in our combined Gold Derby odds with 17/2.\n\nSEE Watch our lively chats with dozens of 2024 Emmy contenders\n\nIn the acting categories, David has of course the most citations in Best Comedy Actor as the center focal point of the show with six nominations, but has not gotten into the race since 2018 for the ninth season. Though this could be his last chance as he now has great odds in third place with 5/1, given the departures of Jason Sudeikis (\"Ted Lasso\") and Bill Hader (\"Barry\") and the ineligibility of Jason Segel (\"Shrinking\").\n\nAs far as the below-the-line categories, \"Curb\" has still never received a writing notice (likely due to the series' improvisational nature). On the other hand, it used to dominate the directing lineup, garnering 10 noms in five seasons, and picked up the trophy in 2003, so it may get some slots this year if the series has enough support. In terms of the Creative Arts, it has mostly been consistent in the pivotal casting and editing categories (the latter it won in 2012), both of which have strong correlation to Best Comedy Series, and has additionally received solo mentions for sound mixing and technical direction for the latest outings.\n\nWith a lot of comedy series clearing out this year, it is the perfect time for \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" to capitalize on those vacancies and perhaps exceed their Emmy tally to celebrate one of the longest-running and most successful, revolutionary comedies of the 21st century.\n\nMake your predictions at Gold Derby now.

        "text": "Investors should grab Apple because it's looking cheap, Bernstein said on Monday, turning bullish on the stock for the first time in years.\n\nThe investment firm upgraded Apple to \"outperform,\" shedding the \"neutral\" rating it's held since 2018. Its $195 price target remained unchanged, signaling 12% upside from where shares stood as of Tuesday.\n\n\"Be like Buffett,\" analyst Toni Sacconaghi wrote in a note: \"Despite his reputation as a long term buy and hold investor, Warren Buffett has been remarkably disciplined at adding to his Apple position when it is relatively cheap and trimming when it is relatively expensive.\"\n\nFor investors, that means adding positions at multiples of 25 times or below, and reducing exposure at more than 30 times. The stock is currently trading at 2024 forward price-earnings ratio of 26.4.\n\nBernstein's change of tune chiefly stems from its outlook on Apple's dilemmas in China, a leading reason for why the smartphone giant has slid 10% in markets this year -- rising competition and iPhone crackdowns in the country have chipped at Apple's standing in the key market.\n\nBut in Bernstein's take, this issue is more cyclical than structural.\n\n\"What we found is, we're getting a price break on it,\" Sacconaghi told CNBC Tuesday. \"We saw the price come down because of the fears over the week, iPhone 15 cycle and because of concerns about China, and we believe that Apple's business model was very much intact.\"\n\nCheap pricing and low expectations for this quarter are setting the stock up for a clearing event, right before Apple enters a seasonally strong trading period, he said.

        "text": "JEFF SMITH FROM CHARLESTON, WV: Have the Steelers ever signed a player who wasn't drafted, who then went on to be an All-Pro? Who do you feel was the Steelers best performer who was not drafted and signed after the draft?\n\nANSWER: Rick Gosselin has been covering the NFL for 50 years, he is the Dallas representative on the Pro Football Hall of Fame selection committee and also serves on the Hall of Fame's sub-committee charged with selecting the individuals chosen to be nominated for induction in the Seniors category. Bluntly, Gosselin knows more about the NFL Draft and the Pro Football Hall of Fame than anybody.\n\nHe recently picked an all-time Undrafted Free Agent Team. It was a 53-player roster of undrafted free agents, and the players on it included 51 Pro Bowlers, 21 Pro Football Hall of Famers, 21 all-decade selections, six members of the NFL's 100th Anniversary Team and five members of the NFL's 50th Anniversary Team. It is a thorough representation, too, because Gosselin built it the way an NFL roster would be built today - \"starting with three quarterbacks and finishing with a special-teams ace and long-snapper.\" He even picked 5 players for a practice squad.\n\nFour Steelers made Gosselin's all-time Undrafted Free Agent Team, and I believe in his ability to do this better than anyone else could, so here they are:\n\n* Willie Parker, 1 of 3 HBs, along with Priest Holmes and Paul Lowe.\n\n* James Harrison, 1 of 4 OLBs, along with Rufus Porter, Bob Swenson, Paris Lenon.\n\n* Jack Butler, 1 of 6 CBs, along with Dick \"Night Train\" Lane, Willie Brown, Emmitt Thomas, Dave Grayson, Everson Walls.\n\n* Donnie Shell, 1 of 4 safeties, along with Emlen Tunnell, Willie Wood, Cliff Harris.\n\nAs for a pick of the Steelers' best-ever undrafted rookie, I would select with one of the four who made Gosselin's team. Which of the four is the best is left to each individual reader of Asked and Answered. I urge anyone interested in an expert analysis of the NFL and its history to follow Gosselin on X (@RickGosselin9) in order to see links to what he writes. It's worth your time.\n\nDownload and listen to the Ask & Answered Podcast here: Apple Podcast | Spotify\n\nRICK BRASKO FROM McKEES ROCKS, PA: I was watching the first round of the NFL Draft, and I noticed that the players who were selected but not physically in Detroit to acknowledge the selection still had a hat for the team that picked them already on hand. How does the process of presenting the player with the hat take place?\n\nANSWER: Those players' agents are given a full set of NFL licensed draft hats in advance, and then whichever team ends up selecting that individual, there is a hat already on site for the player to wear for the television cameras. The NFL Draft has become a television show, with Thursday night's program viewed by an average of 12.1 million people across ESPN, NFL Network, ABC, ESPN Deportes and digital channels. That number represented a 6 percent increase over viewership of Round 1 of the 2023 NFL Draft (11.4 million) and the highest Round 1 viewership since 2021. With that kind of interest and the revenue that interest generates, it has been decided that it's well worth it to have a full complement of hats on hand so the picked player can wear the correct team hat for the cameras.\n\nSHAWN BITTNER FROM JACKSONVILLE, NC: I loved the results of the 2024 draft. Way too early to tell, but I think the Steelers got some good players who will make an impact in 2024. With the three picks of offensive linemen, we have more bodies than roster spots. How many players at offensive line positions do the Steelers typically keep on the 53-man roster? Any thoughts on what that might look like?\n\nANSWER: For the 2023 regular season opener against San Francisco, the Steelers had 9 offensive linemen on their 53-man roster plus 2 more on the practice squad. Currently, there are 16 offensive linemen on the team's 90-man roster. As for your last question, as you wrote in your submission: \"way too early to tell.\"\n\nGRANT SPELLERBERG FROM CUTLER BAY, FL: I know there are no guarantees in the draft. That being said, I was wondering if there are any records showing the \"safest\" position picks. For instance is an offensive lineman more likely to make the cut as opposed to a quarterback?\n\nANSWER: I'm sure those kinds of statistics/analytics exist, but I would question how accurate they could be because of the variables involved. Here is one of the variables I would point out: An offensive lineman drafted would figure to have a better chance to make the cut than a quarterback for the simple reason there are 5 offensive linemen on the field at a time vs. only 1 quarterback, and those discrepancies would be reflected in roster spots allocated to the respective positions. The answer to everything isn't, nor should be, determined by arithmetic.\n\nCHRIS HANN FROM SARASOTA, FL: Most people I have spoken with believe the three diamonds on the Steelers helmet symbolize the three rivers. I was explaining to a friend that's incorrect. Could you please explain what the diamonds symbolize and what the colors mean?\n\nANSWER: First of all, those are not diamonds on the Steelers helmet; those are hypocycloids. Here's the story, and I hereby deputize you to educate those who believe they are \"diamonds\" symbolizing \"the three rivers.\"\n\nIt was 1948 when the Los Angeles Rams allowed running back Fred Gehrke, who came to that team as an art major from the University of Utah, to paint horns on their helmets - mainly because he offered to do it for free. Gehrke's artwork made the Rams the first NFL team to feature a logo on its headgear.\n\nAs the NFL entered the 1950s, other teams copied this, but the Steelers of that era featured each player's jersey number on both sides of a gold helmet. Later into the 1950s, the helmet numbers were removed, and then in 1962 owner Art Rooney Sr. was approached by Republic Steel, headquartered in Cleveland, to suggest the team use the Steelmark as a helmet logo.\n\nThe Steelmark is a symbol created by the American Iron and Steel Institute, and it's in the form of a circle that encloses three hypocycloids and the word \"Steel.\" The hypocycloids are three different colors, which eventually came to represent the three elements used to make steel: yellow for coal, orange for ore, and blue for steel scrap.\n\nWhen the first batch arrived, Rooney wasn't certain they looked all that good on a solid gold helmet. Equipment manager Jackie Hart was instructed to start out by putting them only on one side of the helmet as a kind of visual test. The 1962 Steelers finished 9-5 to become the winningest team in franchise history, and they also qualified for the Playoff Bowl, a postseason exhibition pitting the second-place teams from each of the NFL's two conferences.\n\nWanting to commemorate this achievement, the Steelers switched to black helmets for the Playoff Bowl and ended up liking how the logo popped against a dark background. Rooney's final step was to petition the American Iron and Steel Institute for permission to change the orange hypocycloid to red and change the word \"Steel\" to \"Steelers.\" The look was complete and remains unchanged.\n\nRONNIE CAP FROM YANKTON, SD: How did Ray Seals get his start in the NFL if he did not go to college?\n\nANSWER: You are correct - Ray Seals did not attend college. After graduating from Henninger High School in Syracuse, NY, Seals was a cook, a security guy, a bouncer, and a doorman at the Hotel Syracuse while he was playing football for the semi-pro Syracuse Express, a part of the Empire Football League. Four years after graduating from high school, Seals got himself into the training camp of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. A 6-foot-3, 300-pound defensive lineman who had the quickness and athleticism to be a factor in the pass rush, Seals won a spot on the Buccaneers roster. Seals would play 5 seasons for the Buccaneers, and then as one of the initial group of players who became unrestricted free agents and would sign with other teams, he signed with the Steelers in 1994. He would play 2 seasons with the Steelers (he missed a third with a season-ending shoulder injury that happened in a preseason game), and 1 with the Carolina Panthers. In 90 career NFL games, 62 of which were starts, Seals recorded 32 sacks and forced six fumbles; 15.5 of those sacks and 3 of the 6 forced fumbles came in his 29 games with the Steelers.\n\nJEFF LINTON FROM MORRISVILLE, PA: When I was in high school in the 1970s, I had a football coach by the name of Val Jansante, and he played for the Steelers. I've always wondered about his career. Can you tell me a little about him?\n\nANSWER: You must have attended high school at either Central Catholic in Pittsburgh, or Mon Valley Catholic in Monongahela, Pa., or Bentworth High School in Bentleyville, Pa., because Jansante was a teacher and head football coach at each of those schools after his NFL career. Jansante (6-foot-1, 190 pounds) was a 10th-round pick in the 1944 NFL Draft, but because of World War II he didn't play pro football until the 1946 season. For the Steelers, Jansante was an offensive end who played 65 regular season games, with 48 of those being starts, and in those he caught 155 passes for 2,350 yards (15.3 average), and 14 touchdowns.\n\nDAVID WEHR FROM KIHEI, HI: After the 2024 Draft was completed, the Steelers signed a group of undrafted free agents (UDFA). My last scan of these UFDAs showed 8 signings. What are the restrictions on these signees in dealing with other NFL teams? Are there any restrictions on how many UDFAs a team may sign?\n\nANSWER: Once an undrafted player signs a contract with an NFL team, he is bound to that NFL team for the duration of his contract or until he is waived by the team that signed him. There is no more \"dealing with other NFL teams.\" Teams are permitted to sign as many undrafted free agents as they choose, providing their roster never exceeds the 90-man limit, and the salaries of their top-51 player contracts do not go over the salary cap.\n\nTOM McCORMICK FROM FINDLAY, OH: I realize it isn't guaranteed that any given draft pick will make the 53-man roster. I also realize I can get a custom-made Steelers jersey with my name on the back, but I would like to get a replica of Mason McCormick's jersey. How does the Steelers organization determine which jerseys are available for purchase?\n\nANSWER: It's not the Steelers who decide that. Nike, as the official uniform provider to the NFL since 2012, makes the decision on which jerseys will be manufactured in large enough quantities to be sold in the replica category. Typically, Nike would not choose the jersey of an offensive lineman who was drafted in the fourth round (119th overall) to be manufactured in quantity, and unless that player became an All-Pro, it's unlikely to happen ever. McCormick might not even have his own number through the end of the preseason, because to stay in compliance with the league rules regarding which positions can wear which numbers, teams have an offensive player and a defensive player share the same jersey number until final roster cuts are made in late August.",

It is now my pleasure to introduce our CEO, Ben Gliklich.\n\nBenjamin Gliklich: Thank you, Varun, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining. Element Solutions' strong results for the first quarter reflect solid execution in recovering electronics markets. With a mixed overall macro environment in which our strength and increasing capabilities in fast-growing events packaging and data center markets, offset a mediocre market for smartphones and softness in Western automotive and general industrial supply chains. Our improving value proposition through investments in leading-edge semiconductor technologies and the impact of legacy pricing actions amidst deflation in certain commodities drove substantial profit growth. Constant currency adjusted EBITDA grew 17% year-on-year on the back of over 250 basis points of margin expansion. Our growth this quarter reflects the benefit of portfolio diversification and suggest the potential for further improvement as the electronics market recovery broad. Our focus on deep growing profit pools should continue to generate market outperformance and strong incremental margins. The Electronics business is recovering with a surge in semiconductor solutions, including advanced and wafer level packaging applications. Our volumes in that vertical grew in the high teens year-over-year, outpacing the market and our Circuitry Solutions business. Our more industrially-oriented circuit board assembly business declined slightly. The Industrial and Specialty segment saw a combination of softer automotive demand in the US. and Europe and lower revenue from metal price surcharges as certain commodities have deflated. Profitability in the segment increased significantly on lower raw material costs, ongoing strength in our offshore business and an improvement in our Graphics business. Our markets are roughly off to the start we expected and margins are driving our outperformance. Gross margins returned solidly north of 40% this quarter, an internal benchmark for us and should be stable at these levels borrowing metal price impacts. While many of our supply chains are normalizing after a period of heightened volatility and shortages, logistics prices remained elevated relative to 2019 levels. Notably, our margins in the first quarter have been achieved volumes well below where they had been in the past few years. While our cost of goods are mostly variable, margins have improved despite volume deleveraging. This further underscores the success of our investment in higher value, higher-margin applications and our ability to offset cost increases. The benefit of cost actions taken last year contributed to bottom line profitability as well. This has not come at the cost of growth capital. We continue to invest in strategic capabilities, semiconductor assembly or advanced packaging technologies, a research center in fast-growing EMEA and high-volume manufacturing capacity for our new Kuprion products. Throughout what has been a prolonged downturn in our electronics end markets, we've maintained and in certain instances, grown sales and technical resources needed to support customers as the market evolves and new technologies take root. Our commercial and innovation teams remain focused on delivering high-value solutions to solve customer pain points and high-growth applications. Our late-stage electronic sales pipeline in wafer level packaging and circuitry solutions grew meaningfully in the first quarter. This is in part due to the improved customer intimacy afforded by our highly successful ViaForm transaction, an investment we've made in improving our circuitry technical capabilities. We paid our first product milestone earnout payment for Kuprion this quarter and ActiveCopper opportunities are progressing rapidly. We're pleased with the outlook from our 2023 investments, but work remains on the operational steps necessary to maximize their long-term value. At the same time, our balance sheet is improving to the point where we can consider additional capital deployment aligned with our strategy. The year is off to a solid start and the outlook is positive. Carey will now take you through our first quarter business results in more detail. Carey?\n\nCarey Dorman: Thanks, Ben. Good morning, everyone. Continuing on Slide three where Ben just talked to some of the highlights. You can see a summary of our first quarter financial results. Organic sales grew 1% year-over-year and constant currency adjusted EBITDA grew 17%. These strong incremental margins reflect a substantial mix benefit from recovery in higher-margin semiconductor and Circuitry Business in Asia as well as lower raw material costs in industrial surface treatment and favorable mix in the overall I&S segment. In Q1 2023, the high-end smartphone supply chain and the memory disk markets experienced significantly reduced demand with inventory destocking that continued through much of that year. As we lap this period, we have seen memory disk recovery and growth in smartphone supporting circuitry solutions. Net sales in our Industrial and Specialty segment declined organically 3% at high levels of offshore energy activity and improving North America printer demand in graphics were offset by declines in our industrial surface treatment business. This quarter, total company net sales and adjusted EBITDA were both negatively impacted by strengthening US. dollar by roughly 2% and 4%, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved almost 300 basis points year-over-year in constant currency terms. The margin trend accelerated this quarter, improving sequentially 120 basis points from Q4 2023. Excluding the impact of the $79 million of pass-through metal sales and Assembly Solutions, our adjusted EBITDA margin would have been 26% in the first quarter. On Slide 4, we share additional detail on the drivers of organic net sales growth in our two segments. In Electronics, categories that saw significant destocking from last year, grew in the first quarter of 2024, a positive sign for more broad-based recovery as the year progresses. We saw consistent softness in our industrial-oriented businesses, particularly in the Americas and Europe, that impacted growth in both Industrial Solutions and our Assembly Business in electronics. In Assembly, soft industrial demand in Western markets drove a 2% decline in organic net sales. The circuit board assembly business has more exposure to industrial applications with certain capabilities focused on high reliability alloys required for demanding automotive electronics use cases. While year-over-year volumes in China and Asia were broadly were positive in the quarter, volumes declined in Americas and Europe. Circuitry Solutions sales improved 8% organically, with growth primarily coming from a recovery in our memory disk business. Inventories of our customers' finished products declined in 2023, and this market has picked up again in 2024 on the back of resumed investment in data storage for cloud computing enterprise servers. Our disk drives still represent the most affordable mechanism for data storage per bit and the near-term growth outlook is favorable. The first quarter showed other signs of market stabilization with overall smartphone units estimated to have grown at 8%. However, not all handset OEM supply chain experienced growth in the first quarter of 2024 with the bulk of the improvement occurring in China-based manufacturers. While we do skew towards the non-Chinese device makers, we have content across most smartphone models. Our customer base is broad, and our growth generally should correlate to overall industry units rather than any particular manufacturer over time. Customers globally are expecting an improved second half. Semiconductor Solutions led growth for the segment with organic net sales up 11%. We saw significant increases in wafer level packaging sales in Asia for both semi fabs and [ph]OSAT. We expect a continuation of this demand growth related to advanced packaging that supports memory, server and AI chip markets. Power Electronics products also continued to grow in the first quarter. as we successfully expand our Argomax centered silver technology to a broader customer base of electric vehicle manufacturers. Moving to Industrial & Specialty, organic net sales declined 3% year-over-year. Roughly half of the 6% decline in the Industrial Solutions vertical was driven by reductions in surcharges for commodity metals like palladium. While these price swings impact headline sales, the higher mix of value-add, high-margin recurring chemistry revenue benefits margins. Demand from automotive customers was sluggish, in line with global auto production in the first quarter. European construction and industrial end markets remain soft, with customers continuing to operate at reduced volumes. As we move through 2024, we expect a negative impact of commodity surcharge pricing to ease and new customer wins to benefit sales volume, particularly in the second half of the year. Graphic Solutions sales increased organically by 5%, reflecting improved demand primarily with flexible packaging customers in North America. Encouragingly, adjusted EBITDA margin in this business also showed a meaningful expansion of almost 300 basis points year-on-year. Energy Solutions remains a bright spot in the I&S portfolio with sales growth of 14% organically in the quarter as production and drilling activity remained strong. We expect this growth for energy business to continue this year. Slide five addresses cash flow and the balance sheet. We generated $39 million of free cash flow in Q1. The first quarter of the year has a typical uses of cash relative to annualized targets, including annual incentive payments and a semi-annual bond payment. We invested $28 million in our working capital, which primarily reflects the seasonal inventory build. CapEx in the quarter was $19 million, which is above the $50 million to $60 million annual run rate we expect for the year and reflects the late timing of certain growth projects and integration initiatives that were originally planned for the end of 2023. Now turning to the balance sheet, our net leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.3 times, inside of our long-range target ceiling of 3.5 times and once again demonstrating our ability to quickly de-lever with cash flow generation and earnings growth. Our capital structure remains fully fixed rate for the remainder of the year. We have no debt maturities until 2028. Through cross currency loss, the effective interest rate on our term loan is fixed at 3.2% as of March 31, and our liquidity position remains strong. With that, I will turn the call back to Ben.\n\nBenjamin Gliklich: Thank you, Carey. We've had a strong start to 2024 and are optimistic about the trajectory through here. Our investment in leading-edge and emerging technology is driving high incremental margin sets. While our markets are not uniformly improving, our conversations with customers and suppliers support a constructive view on more broad-based electronic demand improvement in the second half. There are reasons, however, for a level of conservatism this early in the year given geopolitical risk, sluggishness in Western industrial markets and modestly lower full year expectations from certain supply chain participants. For the second quarter of 2024, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $125 million or approximately flat ex currency on a sequential basis. We're also updating our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance range to $515 million to $530 million, which reflects 10% to 14% constant currency growth as the year-over-year FX headwind is now expected to be greater than $15 million. Were it not for the recent strengthening of the US. dollar, we would have increased the high end of the range as well. Overall, we're pleased with our execution to start 2024. Commercially, we're building a high-quality, high-probability pipeline of large leading-edge electronics opportunities and margin-enhancing industrial projects. Operationally, we're increasing volume manufacturing capacity for future growth areas, such as nano copper and power electronics, streamlining our legacy manufacturing footprint and building research and applications development in high-leverage geographies. We continue to make systems improvements and better leverage our data to increase the proportion of time our employees can spend on value-added technical service and product development. Taken together, this positions us towards delivering on our commitments for the year in the current demand environment and generating above-market growth to exceed them as the environment improves from here. To wrap up, I'd like to thank all of our stakeholders for their continued support of Element Solutions, in particular, a talented and dedicated people around the world working productively and collaboratively to support our customers and objectives. With that, operator, please open the lines for questions.\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Josh Spector from UBS. Your line is now open.\n\nJoshua Spector: Hi, guys. Good morning. If you could comment on your expectations here on what you're seeing on demand versus earlier because you talked about things kind of in line, but your first quarter came in better. Obviously, there's been some moving parts. So where things stand today? Do you have a more positive view on second half unchanged, worse, kind of go through where things are set?\n\nBenjamin Gliklich: Sure. So as we get closer to the second half, we have more conviction that a recovery is coming, and we're hearing that more from customers in the electronics side of the business. On balance, I think the rent in the back half is modestly slower than it was expected during the year, right? The semiconductor market, you hear industry participants who were talking about greater than 10% growth, now talking about, about 10% growth. But net-net, the electronics recovery is roughly what we would expect it to be entering the year. On the industrial side of the business, there's pockets of strength in air pockets. As we said in our prepared remarks, our markets are roughly playing out as we thought they would this year, and our outlook is unchanged from a demand perspective.\n\nJoshua Spector: Thanks. That's helpful. And I just wanted to kind of check on here where you recently talked about high single-digit percent growth in Electronics. Over the next five years, you delivered 4% growth in the first quarter. obviously, you expect things to improve a bit. When do you think you get to that run rate? And I don't know if there's a way to unpack how the next year, 1.5 years look from a cyclical improvement perspective versus how that framework impacts more of your secular growth view two to three years from now?\n\nBenjamin Gliklich: Sure. So in the first quarter, right, we had double-digit growth in semiconductor, high single-digit growth in Circuitry and the Assembly business lagged because it's more industrially oriented and the Western industrial economy was soft. By the end of this year, we should be on a year-on-year basis, getting up towards high single-digit growth, call it, mid- to high. And of course, EBITDA growth, and we talked about getting to double-digit EBITDA growth in electronics, we will be at that level in 2024. 2025, if we see a continuation of the electronics recovery, which is a reasonable expectation based on industry outlook should once again be double-digit EBITDA growth, and you'd expect that the electronics business should be in and around the same level of top line that we've been talking about. So that's a medium-term outlook, I would say. But I think it's reasonable to expect that we're about there for the next couple of years.\n\nJoshua Spector: Okay, thanks Ben.\n\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Roberts from Mizuho. Your line is now open.\n\nJohn Ezekiel Roberts: Thanks, and I'll just ask one here, but congrats on the progress on Kuprion. When do you think we'll see first sales? And could you scope the potential additional payments for us?\n\nBenjamin Gliklich: So we paid our first milestone payment for Kuprion this quarter. The background there is Kuprion was a technology we acquired last year with an upfront payment and a large performance-based earn-out structure. The first payment was based on product performance. So that was an internal performance milestone, and we were able to get the product to perform at a certain level, which generated this payment. The subsequent payments will be based on customer success. First, customer product qualification and subsequently customer base revenue. We're working very closely with several customers, and I would expect us to have product qualification payments this year and revenue to begin in 2024 and really ramp in 2025. The maximum we will pay for Kuprion, if we hit all of these targets, it would be about $275 million. That would be linked to about $115 million of revenue, which would be a low single-digit multiple of EBITDA based on the margins we're expecting from this business. We have 6 years to get to that ramp of revenue, but our internal expectation is we'll be able to do so well within that time frame. The customer reaction and pull from the market for this capability is stronger than we could have expected, and our progress against qualification is faster than we expected.\n\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bhavesh Lodaya from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\n\nBhavesh Lodaya: Hi, good morning, Ben. If I look at FY guide, it seems your outlook for the year is roughly unchanged, slightly better. I would have expected second quarter to be up sequentially just on some demand recovery, but also given some of the drivers you highlighted that impacted the first quarter EBITDA. You are building inventory as well. So maybe if you could comment on what you are seeing in your order books in the near term trying to get a sense of the full year guide versus the second quarter guide?\n\nBenjamin Gliklich: Sure. Our expectation for the second quarter, as you heard, was for sequentially flat EBITDA constant currency. And there's about a $2 million, $3 million FX headwind, which gets you to approximately $125 million. There is a modest demand ramp that is offset by some OpEx ramp that we see in the second quarter. And that's how you get to that flat sequential EBITDA. It is consistent demand environment. The industry expects the electronics market ramp to come in the second half. Typical seasonality supports electronics ramp in the second half. I think when you look at half-on-half performance sequentially, it's a slightly greater than normal seasonal uptick in terms of the percentage of earnings in the back half versus the first half. So we feel like it's a reasonable place for the second quarter. April is off to a good start, but we're not going to extrapolate from that. That's how we think about the phasing, and it's generally in line with what we thought entering the year as well.\n\nBhavesh Lodaya: Got it. And then the auto end market is clearly an important one for you. As it relates to your exposure, it appears consultant forecast for Western autos are gradually rising. However, at the same time, there are some concerns around softening EV adoption rates. Can you share your view on what you are seeing for your business?\n\nBenjamin Gliklich: So yes, auto is an important end market for us. Our outlook for auto markets is roughly sideways from where they are today. It's not just units that's impacting our industrial business, it's type of units. So some of the higher-end vehicles are struggling more than entry-level vehicles, and we have more content on the higher-end vehicles. The electric vehicle store is actually generally positive for us despite a softer electric vehicle market. We've seen our really unique capabilities in power inversion, getting much broader adoption in new OEM supply chains. So we've had some pretty compelling customer wins that will contribute modestly this year but significantly over the next several years. So by and large, we're excited about our capabilities in auto and our outlook for the businesses we have exposed to auto, albeit it's a weaker macro this year than ideal.\n\nOperator: Our next question comes from Christopher Parkinson from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\n\nHarris Fein: Great. Thanks. This is Harris Fein on for Chris. I guess from a high level, top line was flat and pass-through metals were neutral in the quarter, but margins were up a good amount year-on-year. So could you just maybe size the drivers of that just between mix, lower raw materials, the offset of the surcharge roll-offs? And I know you guided to some variable cost rebuild this year. I think you might have already mentioned. How much of that hit the P&L in the first quarter? Thanks.\n\nBenjamin Gliklich: Good thing, Harris. There's a lot of moving parts here. The simple answer is that the higher end electronics businesses we have that are really performing well are higher margin. And the businesses that are seeing macro weakness are benefiting from lapping lower raw material prices -- higher raw material prices and favorable mix from those surcharges that have rolled off. And so between the two of those things, right, we saw substantial margin uplift and there was a modest impact, I would say, from the cost actions we took last year, offsetting some of that variable cost rebuild. So those are the two moving pieces. Raw material deflation year-over-year was a low single-digit million-dollar impact, just to help you quantify what those pieces are. And what we said in our prepared remarks is margins are stably north of 40% on the gross profit line. And we see room for improvement in margin over time driven by divergent growth rates and the higher value proposition we're bringing to support high-end electronics customers. So we're far from our margin ceiling and should see progress from here.\n\nHarris Fein: Got it. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up in Circuitry, a lot of the debates with investors around smartphone, but that doesn't seem to be the primary driver of results right now. So just with demand recovery, I know you called out memory disk and server, just how are you thinking about normalized intermediate-term growth rates, what that looks like in that business?\n\nBenjamin Gliklich: Yes. So within our Circuitry business, there are really three moving pieces this quarter. Smartphone markets grew, Western industrial markets softened, and so our Circuitry business in Europe and the Americas was soft. Those two didn't quite offset, right? The Asian business is bigger. And so the smartphone uplift more than offset the softness in the West and then our memory disk business grew very nicely returned to growth. That memory disk business is for hard disk drives. As Carey said, they're still the lowest cost per bit storage alternative. And all of this activity in AI is driving incremental or disk drive demand. So those are the three moving pieces. The smartphone market, while it grew is still very dislocated from trend. And so we believe there's still incremental recovery there. At high margin and the memory disk market should continue to improve as well. So the Circuitry business should be a mid- to high single-digit grower from here for the foreseeable future.\n\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Byrne from Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ). Your line is now open.\n\nRock Hoffman Blasko: Hi it's Rock Hoffman on for Steve Byrne. Just given the OpEx ramp in 2Q that you just mentioned, how do you think the near-term EBITDA margin might play out for the rest of the year kind of compared to what we saw in 1Q? And how much of a lever will mix benefits for the rest of the year?\n\nBenjamin Gliklich: Thanks for the question. So EBITDA margin should be stable around where they are right now in the second quarter, maybe modestly softer because of that OpEx ramp. But in the back half, they should continue to improve again, as we said, we are several points away from past peak EBITDA margin ex metal. I don't think we're going to get back there this year, but we've got room to drive that margin higher and multiple levers, right? We made comments about volume being down. And so we're still facing volume deleveraging in the business. And so we've got multiple levers for margin expansion from here and are confident we can drive that in the medium term.\n\nRock Hoffman Blasko: That's helpful. And just in semiconductor, specifically, was the strength in the business this quarter. I guess how much of that was kind of a result of a customer operating rates versus the mix gains that you guys saw?\n\nBenjamin Gliklich: Our semiconductor business rent because of customer operating rates because of customer wins. And that was organic volume growth, by and large, with a margin contribution from our ViaForm transaction last year.\n\nRock Hoffman Blasko: Helpful. Thank you\n\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Kapsch from Loop Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\n\nChristopher Kapsch: Good morning. So my question also on -- focused on EBITDA margins and more about the incremental margin is not about -- less about absolute margin levels. The strong EBITDA growth you had relative to a much more modest organic top line growth, the implication, as you referenced, like really robust incremental margin. So the question is, as the balance of this year plays out, like if you have continued growth in recovery in Electronics and potentially positive mix that comes with that and then hopefully some seasonal improvement across the broader portfolio. Is there a reason to think, other than the build back in OpEx? Is it that there'd be some reversion on incrementals? Or is there a case that incrementals are just simply structurally higher than you previously thought because of just both the overall mix of your portfolio and maybe some of the pricing entitlements that you've implemented?\n\nCarey Dorman: Thanks for that question, Chris. I think our view on incrementals are the conservatively 30% to 40% through the cycle. Obviously, this quarter was a bit idiosyncratic given a flattish organic performance and substantial organic EBITDA growth. We could see quarters like that in the future depending on mix and underlying demand. But I don't think we're going to say that structurally, incremental margins are changed from here. There is some conservatism in that 30% to 40% because some of our new technologies carry much, much higher margin than the core of the business. And as those ramp, they will improve. But I'm not sure we would draw a line in the sand and say that our view on incrementals have permanently changed after one quarter.\n\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Silver from CL King. Your line is now open.\n\nDavid Silver: Yeah hi. Good morning. I just have a couple of questions. I'll ask them both together, I guess. But as far as the ViaForm performance goes, I think this is the second consecutive quarter was kind of called out for its strength. And just wondering, is there any way to think about how much improvement you're thinking might be in 2024 over 2023? I know that the implication was when the deal was struck to repurchase the distribution rights that it was being purchased kind of at a below normal or below trend level of profitability? And then just along with that, is there anything -- or how would you say the business is being run with ESI, with your company in full control as opposed to the previous arrangement where another company was in charge of marketing and distribution?\n\nBenjamin Gliklich: Thanks for that question. We felt good about our timing for the ViaForm transaction. And we have benefited from the ramp in operating rates at customers over the past couple of quarters. Most of the growth we've seen has been driven by that. But the opportunity pipeline associated with it has grown and the applications window has grown as there's -- it is used in applications like hybrid bonding. So there's an opportunity for us with ViaForm to expand -- or it's an expanding addressable market. And by being in full control from soup to nuts of this product, we believe we're generating more commercial opportunities than we would have otherwise seen. And so this year, the business will grow double digits in line, slightly better than MSI. And the long-term outlook is for significant outperformance relative to MSI because of this growth in pipeline, share opportunities and growth in addressable market. It's a very compelling opportunity set for us. We're thrilled by that transaction.\n\nDavid Silver: Okay. Great. And then just one on the R&D spend. So the first quarter, the number is much higher year-over-year, but I do believe Carey mentioned last night that, that includes the progress payment related to Kuprion there. But my sense is your business is becoming structurally more R&D intensive. So is there kind of a target percentage of revenues or absolute total we should think about for adjusted or clean R&D spend, maybe for the balance of the year or going forward?\n\nBenjamin Gliklich: You're right to point out that the milestone payment for Kuprion was captured in R&D this quarter, which explains the large increase year-over-year. Our business invest R&D dollars not just captured on the R&D line in the P&L, but also in technical service and application development, which is captured under selling and technical service in the P&L. We do have and we have increased investment in technology, particularly at the leading-edge electronics nodes. But the breadth of our portfolio doesn't really make it apples-to-apples to compare our R&D spend as captured on the R&D line and the P&L to other electronics materials companies. I think that our target is to continue to invest aggressively where we have opportunities in support of our customers. And so R&D will grow roughly in line with sales, which should be growing nicely, maybe a little bit faster. But our business hasn't structurally changed in terms of its R&D needs going forward.\n\nCarey Dorman: And David, I would just add that some of the ramp we've seen in CapEx over the last couple of years has been to support -- a decent portion of that has been to support lab expansion, both applications lab and our core R&D labs as well as equipment to support that. So that's also R&D spend that we're investing, obviously, just showing up in the cash flow statement.\n\nDavid Silver: Okay. No, that's the, I appreciate the perspective there. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator: Next question comes from John Tanwanteng from CJS Securities. Your line is now open.\n\nJonathan Tanwanteng: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions and nice quarter. Just wanted to ask you about your semi business, AI has obviously been making headlines as well as the chips act and onshoring initiatives in other countries. Could you update us on how those things will flow through your semi business over the next one to three years? And how big it could become as a percentage of revenue? I know you gave some details on ViaForm, but if you could talk about the whole business, that would be great as a percent of profit as well.\n\nBenjamin Gliklich: Sure. Thanks for that question, John. So, our semi business has accelerated this year. It has a lot of runway to continue to grow and we expect it to outgrow the rest of our verticals and the rest of the electronics business. And so, it will grow as a percentage of sales. You're right to point out the chips act, the chips act is bringing significant investment into fab capacity in North America. We're seeing incremental fab capacity in Europe. And with ViaForm, which we just pointed out and other investments we've been making we feel like we're in a prime position to get more than our existing share where we play in these new fabs, which will grow -- which will drive above market growth here. Also with regard to the chips act, we have an opportunity that we're pursuing to receive some funding from the chips act for R&D, which is very exciting and should stimulate incremental growth in the business and opportunities in the business. The semiconductor business is 10-ish percent of our overall revenue. But given its divergent growth rate, it will increase as a percentage of the overall book of business and could conceivably be 20% of the business in the medium term. And we're investing aggressively behind that, but only in places where it fits our operating model where the profit pools are deep and where we've got a right to win. So, we are being circumspect about where we invest and where we choose to play. But we've got great capabilities and a lot of customer pull for them, which is compelling and exciting for us.\n\nJonathan Tanwanteng: Great, thank you. And then just in terms of the guidance and the underlying assumptions, what's the change in your expectations for China versus non-China handsets? And also ICE versus EV automotive, does that mix impact you as year progresses? Just help us understand your thoughts in those two areas.\n\nBenjamin Gliklich: So our business in smartphones skews towards non-Chinese OEMs, right? So we've got more value and share on non-Chinese device makers than local Chinese device makers, but we still have plenty of value in local Chinese smartphones. And so in a quarter like this past quarter where units were up maybe 8%, despite non-Chinese OEMs or Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) devices being down, we still group, our smartphone business. And so that's our baseline for the balance of the year. It doesn't have any big assumption associated with the OEMs providing the smartphones. It's just a smartphone growth driver. And with regard to ICE and EVs, that's a difficult thing for us to parse out because there are plenty of supply chains that we sell into that are EV or powertrain agnostic. And so I can't answer that question specifically, I would say that the general weakness relative to expectations in EV is something of a headwind but it hasn't changed our outlook for the full year.\n\nOperator: We don't have any questions at the moment. I'd now like to hand back over to Ben for closing remarks.\n\nBenjamin Gliklich: Great. Thank you very much. Thanks to everybody for joining, and we look forward to seeing many of you soon. Have a good day.\n\nOperator: We would like to thank everyone for attending today's conference call. We hope that you have a wonderful day. Thank you, and you may now disconnect with the session.",

It is now my pleasure to introduce our CEO, Ben Gliklich.\n\nBenjamin Gliklich: Thank you, Varun, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining. Element Solutions' strong results for the first quarter reflect solid execution in recovering electronics markets. With a mixed overall macro environment in which our strength and increasing capabilities in fast-growing events packaging and data center markets, offset a mediocre market for smartphones and softness in Western automotive and general industrial supply chains. Our improving value proposition through investments in leading-edge semiconductor technologies and the impact of legacy pricing actions amidst deflation in certain commodities drove substantial profit growth. Constant currency adjusted EBITDA grew 17% year-on-year on the back of over 250 basis points of margin expansion. Our growth this quarter reflects the benefit of portfolio diversification and suggest the potential for further improvement as the electronics market recovery broad. Our focus on deep growing profit pools should continue to generate market outperformance and strong incremental margins. The Electronics business is recovering with a surge in semiconductor solutions, including advanced and wafer level packaging applications. Our volumes in that vertical grew in the high teens year-over-year, outpacing the market and our Circuitry Solutions business. Our more industrially-oriented circuit board assembly business declined slightly. The Industrial and Specialty segment saw a combination of softer automotive demand in the US. and Europe and lower revenue from metal price surcharges as certain commodities have deflated. Profitability in the segment increased significantly on lower raw material costs, ongoing strength in our offshore business and an improvement in our Graphics business. Our markets are roughly off to the start we expected and margins are driving our outperformance. Gross margins returned solidly north of 40% this quarter, an internal benchmark for us and should be stable at these levels borrowing metal price impacts. While many of our supply chains are normalizing after a period of heightened volatility and shortages, logistics prices remained elevated relative to 2019 levels. Notably, our margins in the first quarter have been achieved volumes well below where they had been in the past few years. While our cost of goods are mostly variable, margins have improved despite volume deleveraging. This further underscores the success of our investment in higher value, higher-margin applications and our ability to offset cost increases. The benefit of cost actions taken last year contributed to bottom line profitability as well. This has not come at the cost of growth capital. We continue to invest in strategic capabilities, semiconductor assembly or advanced packaging technologies, a research center in fast-growing EMEA and high-volume manufacturing capacity for our new Kuprion products. Throughout what has been a prolonged downturn in our electronics end markets, we've maintained and in certain instances, grown sales and technical resources needed to support customers as the market evolves and new technologies take root. Our commercial and innovation teams remain focused on delivering high-value solutions to solve customer pain points and high-growth applications. Our late-stage electronic sales pipeline in wafer level packaging and circuitry solutions grew meaningfully in the first quarter. This is in part due to the improved customer intimacy afforded by our highly successful ViaForm transaction, an investment we've made in improving our circuitry technical capabilities. We paid our first product milestone earnout payment for Kuprion this quarter and ActiveCopper opportunities are progressing rapidly. We're pleased with the outlook from our 2023 investments, but work remains on the operational steps necessary to maximize their long-term value. At the same time, our balance sheet is improving to the point where we can consider additional capital deployment aligned with our strategy. The year is off to a solid start and the outlook is positive. Carey will now take you through our first quarter business results in more detail. Carey?\n\nCarey Dorman: Thanks, Ben. Good morning, everyone. Continuing on Slide three where Ben just talked to some of the highlights. You can see a summary of our first quarter financial results. Organic sales grew 1% year-over-year and constant currency adjusted EBITDA grew 17%. These strong incremental margins reflect a substantial mix benefit from recovery in higher-margin semiconductor and Circuitry Business in Asia as well as lower raw material costs in industrial surface treatment and favorable mix in the overall I&S segment. In Q1 2023, the high-end smartphone supply chain and the memory disk markets experienced significantly reduced demand with inventory destocking that continued through much of that year. As we lap this period, we have seen memory disk recovery and growth in smartphone supporting circuitry solutions. Net sales in our Industrial and Specialty segment declined organically 3% at high levels of offshore energy activity and improving North America printer demand in graphics were offset by declines in our industrial surface treatment business. This quarter, total company net sales and adjusted EBITDA were both negatively impacted by strengthening US. dollar by roughly 2% and 4%, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved almost 300 basis points year-over-year in constant currency terms. The margin trend accelerated this quarter, improving sequentially 120 basis points from Q4 2023. Excluding the impact of the $79 million of pass-through metal sales and Assembly Solutions, our adjusted EBITDA margin would have been 26% in the first quarter. On Slide 4, we share additional detail on the drivers of organic net sales growth in our two segments. In Electronics, categories that saw significant destocking from last year, grew in the first quarter of 2024, a positive sign for more broad-based recovery as the year progresses. We saw consistent softness in our industrial-oriented businesses, particularly in the Americas and Europe, that impacted growth in both Industrial Solutions and our Assembly Business in electronics. In Assembly, soft industrial demand in Western markets drove a 2% decline in organic net sales. The circuit board assembly business has more exposure to industrial applications with certain capabilities focused on high reliability alloys required for demanding automotive electronics use cases. While year-over-year volumes in China and Asia were broadly were positive in the quarter, volumes declined in Americas and Europe. Circuitry Solutions sales improved 8% organically, with growth primarily coming from a recovery in our memory disk business. Inventories of our customers' finished products declined in 2023, and this market has picked up again in 2024 on the back of resumed investment in data storage for cloud computing enterprise servers. Our disk drives still represent the most affordable mechanism for data storage per bit and the near-term growth outlook is favorable. The first quarter showed other signs of market stabilization with overall smartphone units estimated to have grown at 8%. However, not all handset OEM supply chain experienced growth in the first quarter of 2024 with the bulk of the improvement occurring in China-based manufacturers. While we do skew towards the non-Chinese device makers, we have content across most smartphone models. Our customer base is broad, and our growth generally should correlate to overall industry units rather than any particular manufacturer over time. Customers globally are expecting an improved second half. Semiconductor Solutions led growth for the segment with organic net sales up 11%. We saw significant increases in wafer level packaging sales in Asia for both semi fabs and [ph]OSAT. We expect a continuation of this demand growth related to advanced packaging that supports memory, server and AI chip markets. Power Electronics products also continued to grow in the first quarter. as we successfully expand our Argomax centered silver technology to a broader customer base of electric vehicle manufacturers. Moving to Industrial & Specialty, organic net sales declined 3% year-over-year. Roughly half of the 6% decline in the Industrial Solutions vertical was driven by reductions in surcharges for commodity metals like palladium. While these price swings impact headline sales, the higher mix of value-add, high-margin recurring chemistry revenue benefits margins. Demand from automotive customers was sluggish, in line with global auto production in the first quarter. European construction and industrial end markets remain soft, with customers continuing to operate at reduced volumes. As we move through 2024, we expect a negative impact of commodity surcharge pricing to ease and new customer wins to benefit sales volume, particularly in the second half of the year. Graphic Solutions sales increased organically by 5%, reflecting improved demand primarily with flexible packaging customers in North America. Encouragingly, adjusted EBITDA margin in this business also showed a meaningful expansion of almost 300 basis points year-on-year. Energy Solutions remains a bright spot in the I&S portfolio with sales growth of 14% organically in the quarter as production and drilling activity remained strong. We expect this growth for energy business to continue this year. Slide five addresses cash flow and the balance sheet. We generated $39 million of free cash flow in Q1. The first quarter of the year has a typical uses of cash relative to annualized targets, including annual incentive payments and a semi-annual bond payment. We invested $28 million in our working capital, which primarily reflects the seasonal inventory build. CapEx in the quarter was $19 million, which is above the $50 million to $60 million annual run rate we expect for the year and reflects the late timing of certain growth projects and integration initiatives that were originally planned for the end of 2023. Now turning to the balance sheet, our net leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.3 times, inside of our long-range target ceiling of 3.5 times and once again demonstrating our ability to quickly de-lever with cash flow generation and earnings growth. Our capital structure remains fully fixed rate for the remainder of the year. We have no debt maturities until 2028. Through cross currency loss, the effective interest rate on our term loan is fixed at 3.2% as of March 31, and our liquidity position remains strong. With that, I will turn the call back to Ben.\n\nBenjamin Gliklich: Thank you, Carey. We've had a strong start to 2024 and are optimistic about the trajectory through here. Our investment in leading-edge and emerging technology is driving high incremental margin sets. While our markets are not uniformly improving, our conversations with customers and suppliers support a constructive view on more broad-based electronic demand improvement in the second half. There are reasons, however, for a level of conservatism this early in the year given geopolitical risk, sluggishness in Western industrial markets and modestly lower full year expectations from certain supply chain participants. For the second quarter of 2024, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $125 million or approximately flat ex currency on a sequential basis. We're also updating our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance range to $515 million to $530 million, which reflects 10% to 14% constant currency growth as the year-over-year FX headwind is now expected to be greater than $15 million. Were it not for the recent strengthening of the US. dollar, we would have increased the high end of the range as well. Overall, we're pleased with our execution to start 2024. Commercially, we're building a high-quality, high-probability pipeline of large leading-edge electronics opportunities and margin-enhancing industrial projects. Operationally, we're increasing volume manufacturing capacity for future growth areas, such as nano copper and power electronics, streamlining our legacy manufacturing footprint and building research and applications development in high-leverage geographies. We continue to make systems improvements and better leverage our data to increase the proportion of time our employees can spend on value-added technical service and product development. Taken together, this positions us towards delivering on our commitments for the year in the current demand environment and generating above-market growth to exceed them as the environment improves from here. To wrap up, I'd like to thank all of our stakeholders for their continued support of Element Solutions, in particular, a talented and dedicated people around the world working productively and collaboratively to support our customers and objectives. With that, operator, please open the lines for questions.\n\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Josh Spector from UBS. Your line is now open.\n\nJoshua Spector: Hi, guys. Good morning. If you could comment on your expectations here on what you're seeing on demand versus earlier because you talked about things kind of in line, but your first quarter came in better. Obviously, there's been some moving parts. So where things stand today? Do you have a more positive view on second half unchanged, worse, kind of go through where things are set?\n\nBenjamin Gliklich: Sure. So as we get closer to the second half, we have more conviction that a recovery is coming, and we're hearing that more from customers in the electronics side of the business. On balance, I think the rent in the back half is modestly slower than it was expected during the year, right? The semiconductor market, you hear industry participants who were talking about greater than 10% growth, now talking about, about 10% growth. But net-net, the electronics recovery is roughly what we would expect it to be entering the year. On the industrial side of the business, there's pockets of strength in air pockets. As we said in our prepared remarks, our markets are roughly playing out as we thought they would this year, and our outlook is unchanged from a demand perspective.\n\nJoshua Spector: Thanks. That's helpful. And I just wanted to kind of check on here where you recently talked about high single-digit percent growth in Electronics. Over the next five years, you delivered 4% growth in the first quarter. obviously, you expect things to improve a bit. When do you think you get to that run rate? And I don't know if there's a way to unpack how the next year, 1.5 years look from a cyclical improvement perspective versus how that framework impacts more of your secular growth view two to three years from now?\n\nBenjamin Gliklich: Sure. So in the first quarter, right, we had double-digit growth in semiconductor, high single-digit growth in Circuitry and the Assembly business lagged because it's more industrially oriented and the Western industrial economy was soft. By the end of this year, we should be on a year-on-year basis, getting up towards high single-digit growth, call it, mid- to high. And of course, EBITDA growth, and we talked about getting to double-digit EBITDA growth in electronics, we will be at that level in 2024. 2025, if we see a continuation of the electronics recovery, which is a reasonable expectation based on industry outlook should once again be double-digit EBITDA growth, and you'd expect that the electronics business should be in and around the same level of top line that we've been talking about. So that's a medium-term outlook, I would say. But I think it's reasonable to expect that we're about there for the next couple of years.\n\nJoshua Spector: Okay, thanks Ben.\n\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Roberts from Mizuho. Your line is now open.\n\nJohn Ezekiel Roberts: Thanks, and I'll just ask one here, but congrats on the progress on Kuprion. When do you think we'll see first sales? And could you scope the potential additional payments for us?\n\nBenjamin Gliklich: So we paid our first milestone payment for Kuprion this quarter. The background there is Kuprion was a technology we acquired last year with an upfront payment and a large performance-based earn-out structure. The first payment was based on product performance. So that was an internal performance milestone, and we were able to get the product to perform at a certain level, which generated this payment. The subsequent payments will be based on customer success. First, customer product qualification and subsequently customer base revenue. We're working very closely with several customers, and I would expect us to have product qualification payments this year and revenue to begin in 2024 and really ramp in 2025. The maximum we will pay for Kuprion, if we hit all of these targets, it would be about $275 million. That would be linked to about $115 million of revenue, which would be a low single-digit multiple of EBITDA based on the margins we're expecting from this business. We have 6 years to get to that ramp of revenue, but our internal expectation is we'll be able to do so well within that time frame. The customer reaction and pull from the market for this capability is stronger than we could have expected, and our progress against qualification is faster than we expected.\n\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bhavesh Lodaya from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\n\nBhavesh Lodaya: Hi, good morning, Ben. If I look at FY guide, it seems your outlook for the year is roughly unchanged, slightly better. I would have expected second quarter to be up sequentially just on some demand recovery, but also given some of the drivers you highlighted that impacted the first quarter EBITDA. You are building inventory as well. So maybe if you could comment on what you are seeing in your order books in the near term trying to get a sense of the full year guide versus the second quarter guide?\n\nBenjamin Gliklich: Sure. Our expectation for the second quarter, as you heard, was for sequentially flat EBITDA constant currency. And there's about a $2 million, $3 million FX headwind, which gets you to approximately $125 million. There is a modest demand ramp that is offset by some OpEx ramp that we see in the second quarter. And that's how you get to that flat sequential EBITDA. It is consistent demand environment. The industry expects the electronics market ramp to come in the second half. Typical seasonality supports electronics ramp in the second half. I think when you look at half-on-half performance sequentially, it's a slightly greater than normal seasonal uptick in terms of the percentage of earnings in the back half versus the first half. So we feel like it's a reasonable place for the second quarter. April is off to a good start, but we're not going to extrapolate from that. That's how we think about the phasing, and it's generally in line with what we thought entering the year as well.\n\nBhavesh Lodaya: Got it. And then the auto end market is clearly an important one for you. As it relates to your exposure, it appears consultant forecast for Western autos are gradually rising. However, at the same time, there are some concerns around softening EV adoption rates. Can you share your view on what you are seeing for your business?\n\nBenjamin Gliklich: So yes, auto is an important end market for us. Our outlook for auto markets is roughly sideways from where they are today. It's not just units that's impacting our industrial business, it's type of units. So some of the higher-end vehicles are struggling more than entry-level vehicles, and we have more content on the higher-end vehicles. The electric vehicle store is actually generally positive for us despite a softer electric vehicle market. We've seen our really unique capabilities in power inversion, getting much broader adoption in new OEM supply chains. So we've had some pretty compelling customer wins that will contribute modestly this year but significantly over the next several years. So by and large, we're excited about our capabilities in auto and our outlook for the businesses we have exposed to auto, albeit it's a weaker macro this year than ideal.\n\nOperator: Our next question comes from Christopher Parkinson from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\n\nHarris Fein: Great. Thanks. This is Harris Fein on for Chris. I guess from a high level, top line was flat and pass-through metals were neutral in the quarter, but margins were up a good amount year-on-year. So could you just maybe size the drivers of that just between mix, lower raw materials, the offset of the surcharge roll-offs? And I know you guided to some variable cost rebuild this year. I think you might have already mentioned. How much of that hit the P&L in the first quarter? Thanks.\n\nBenjamin Gliklich: Good thing, Harris. There's a lot of moving parts here. The simple answer is that the higher end electronics businesses we have that are really performing well are higher margin. And the businesses that are seeing macro weakness are benefiting from lapping lower raw material prices -- higher raw material prices and favorable mix from those surcharges that have rolled off. And so between the two of those things, right, we saw substantial margin uplift and there was a modest impact, I would say, from the cost actions we took last year, offsetting some of that variable cost rebuild. So those are the two moving pieces. Raw material deflation year-over-year was a low single-digit million-dollar impact, just to help you quantify what those pieces are. And what we said in our prepared remarks is margins are stably north of 40% on the gross profit line. And we see room for improvement in margin over time driven by divergent growth rates and the higher value proposition we're bringing to support high-end electronics customers. So we're far from our margin ceiling and should see progress from here.\n\nHarris Fein: Got it. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up in Circuitry, a lot of the debates with investors around smartphone, but that doesn't seem to be the primary driver of results right now. So just with demand recovery, I know you called out memory disk and server, just how are you thinking about normalized intermediate-term growth rates, what that looks like in that business?\n\nBenjamin Gliklich: Yes. So within our Circuitry business, there are really three moving pieces this quarter. Smartphone markets grew, Western industrial markets softened, and so our Circuitry business in Europe and the Americas was soft. Those two didn't quite offset, right? The Asian business is bigger. And so the smartphone uplift more than offset the softness in the West and then our memory disk business grew very nicely returned to growth. That memory disk business is for hard disk drives. As Carey said, they're still the lowest cost per bit storage alternative. And all of this activity in AI is driving incremental or disk drive demand. So those are the three moving pieces. The smartphone market, while it grew is still very dislocated from trend. And so we believe there's still incremental recovery there. At high margin and the memory disk market should continue to improve as well. So the Circuitry business should be a mid- to high single-digit grower from here for the foreseeable future.\n\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Your line is now open.\n\nRock Hoffman Blasko: Hi it's Rock Hoffman on for Steve Byrne. Just given the OpEx ramp in 2Q that you just mentioned, how do you think the near-term EBITDA margin might play out for the rest of the year kind of compared to what we saw in 1Q? And how much of a lever will mix benefits for the rest of the year?\n\nBenjamin Gliklich: Thanks for the question. So EBITDA margin should be stable around where they are right now in the second quarter, maybe modestly softer because of that OpEx ramp. But in the back half, they should continue to improve again, as we said, we are several points away from past peak EBITDA margin ex metal. I don't think we're going to get back there this year, but we've got room to drive that margin higher and multiple levers, right? We made comments about volume being down. And so we're still facing volume deleveraging in the business. And so we've got multiple levers for margin expansion from here and are confident we can drive that in the medium term.\n\nRock Hoffman Blasko: That's helpful. And just in semiconductor, specifically, was the strength in the business this quarter. I guess how much of that was kind of a result of a customer operating rates versus the mix gains that you guys saw?\n\nBenjamin Gliklich: Our semiconductor business rent because of customer operating rates because of customer wins. And that was organic volume growth, by and large, with a margin contribution from our ViaForm transaction last year.\n\nRock Hoffman Blasko: Helpful. Thank you\n\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Kapsch from Loop Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\n\nChristopher Kapsch: Good morning. So my question also on -- focused on EBITDA margins and more about the incremental margin is not about -- less about absolute margin levels. The strong EBITDA growth you had relative to a much more modest organic top line growth, the implication, as you referenced, like really robust incremental margin. So the question is, as the balance of this year plays out, like if you have continued growth in recovery in Electronics and potentially positive mix that comes with that and then hopefully some seasonal improvement across the broader portfolio. Is there a reason to think, other than the build back in OpEx? Is it that there'd be some reversion on incrementals? Or is there a case that incrementals are just simply structurally higher than you previously thought because of just both the overall mix of your portfolio and maybe some of the pricing entitlements that you've implemented?\n\nCarey Dorman: Thanks for that question, Chris. I think our view on incrementals are the conservatively 30% to 40% through the cycle. Obviously, this quarter was a bit idiosyncratic given a flattish organic performance and substantial organic EBITDA growth. We could see quarters like that in the future depending on mix and underlying demand. But I don't think we're going to say that structurally, incremental margins are changed from here. There is some conservatism in that 30% to 40% because some of our new technologies carry much, much higher margin than the core of the business. And as those ramp, they will improve. But I'm not sure we would draw a line in the sand and say that our view on incrementals have permanently changed after one quarter.\n\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Silver from CL King. Your line is now open.\n\nDavid Silver: Yeah hi. Good morning. I just have a couple of questions. I'll ask them both together, I guess. But as far as the ViaForm performance goes, I think this is the second consecutive quarter was kind of called out for its strength. And just wondering, is there any way to think about how much improvement you're thinking might be in 2024 over 2023? I know that the implication was when the deal was struck to repurchase the distribution rights that it was being purchased kind of at a below normal or below trend level of profitability? And then just along with that, is there anything -- or how would you say the business is being run with ESI, with your company in full control as opposed to the previous arrangement where another company was in charge of marketing and distribution?\n\nBenjamin Gliklich: Thanks for that question. We felt good about our timing for the ViaForm transaction. And we have benefited from the ramp in operating rates at customers over the past couple of quarters. Most of the growth we've seen has been driven by that. But the opportunity pipeline associated with it has grown and the applications window has grown as there's -- it is used in applications like hybrid bonding. So there's an opportunity for us with ViaForm to expand -- or it's an expanding addressable market. And by being in full control from soup to nuts of this product, we believe we're generating more commercial opportunities than we would have otherwise seen. And so this year, the business will grow double digits in line, slightly better than MSI. And the long-term outlook is for significant outperformance relative to MSI because of this growth in pipeline, share opportunities and growth in addressable market. It's a very compelling opportunity set for us. We're thrilled by that transaction.\n\nDavid Silver: Okay. Great. And then just one on the R&D spend. So the first quarter, the number is much higher year-over-year, but I do believe Carey mentioned last night that, that includes the progress payment related to Kuprion there. But my sense is your business is becoming structurally more R&D intensive. So is there kind of a target percentage of revenues or absolute total we should think about for adjusted or clean R&D spend, maybe for the balance of the year or going forward?\n\nBenjamin Gliklich: You're right to point out that the milestone payment for Kuprion was captured in R&D this quarter, which explains the large increase year-over-year. Our business invest R&D dollars not just captured on the R&D line in the P&L, but also in technical service and application development, which is captured under selling and technical service in the P&L. We do have and we have increased investment in technology, particularly at the leading-edge electronics nodes. But the breadth of our portfolio doesn't really make it apples-to-apples to compare our R&D spend as captured on the R&D line and the P&L to other electronics materials companies. I think that our target is to continue to invest aggressively where we have opportunities in support of our customers. And so R&D will grow roughly in line with sales, which should be growing nicely, maybe a little bit faster. But our business hasn't structurally changed in terms of its R&D needs going forward.\n\nCarey Dorman: And David, I would just add that some of the ramp we've seen in CapEx over the last couple of years has been to support -- a decent portion of that has been to support lab expansion, both applications lab and our core R&D labs as well as equipment to support that. So that's also R&D spend that we're investing, obviously, just showing up in the cash flow statement.\n\nDavid Silver: Okay. No, that's the, I appreciate the perspective there. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator: Next question comes from John Tanwanteng from CJS Securities. Your line is now open.\n\nJonathan Tanwanteng: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions and nice quarter. Just wanted to ask you about your semi business, AI has obviously been making headlines as well as the chips act and onshoring initiatives in other countries. Could you update us on how those things will flow through your semi business over the next one to three years? And how big it could become as a percentage of revenue? I know you gave some details on ViaForm, but if you could talk about the whole business, that would be great as a percent of profit as well.\n\nBenjamin Gliklich: Sure. Thanks for that question, John. So, our semi business has accelerated this year. It has a lot of runway to continue to grow and we expect it to outgrow the rest of our verticals and the rest of the electronics business. And so, it will grow as a percentage of sales. You're right to point out the chips act, the chips act is bringing significant investment into fab capacity in North America. We're seeing incremental fab capacity in Europe. And with ViaForm, which we just pointed out and other investments we've been making we feel like we're in a prime position to get more than our existing share where we play in these new fabs, which will grow -- which will drive above market growth here. Also with regard to the chips act, we have an opportunity that we're pursuing to receive some funding from the chips act for R&D, which is very exciting and should stimulate incremental growth in the business and opportunities in the business. The semiconductor business is 10-ish percent of our overall revenue. But given its divergent growth rate, it will increase as a percentage of the overall book of business and could conceivably be 20% of the business in the medium term. And we're investing aggressively behind that, but only in places where it fits our operating model where the profit pools are deep and where we've got a right to win. So, we are being circumspect about where we invest and where we choose to play. But we've got great capabilities and a lot of customer pull for them, which is compelling and exciting for us.\n\nJonathan Tanwanteng: Great, thank you. And then just in terms of the guidance and the underlying assumptions, what's the change in your expectations for China versus non-China handsets? And also ICE versus EV automotive, does that mix impact you as year progresses? Just help us understand your thoughts in those two areas.\n\nBenjamin Gliklich: So our business in smartphones skews towards non-Chinese OEMs, right? So we've got more value and share on non-Chinese device makers than local Chinese device makers, but we still have plenty of value in local Chinese smartphones. And so in a quarter like this past quarter where units were up maybe 8%, despite non-Chinese OEMs or Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) devices being down, we still group, our smartphone business. And so that's our baseline for the balance of the year. It doesn't have any big assumption associated with the OEMs providing the smartphones. It's just a smartphone growth driver. And with regard to ICE and EVs, that's a difficult thing for us to parse out because there are plenty of supply chains that we sell into that are EV or powertrain agnostic. And so I can't answer that question specifically, I would say that the general weakness relative to expectations in EV is something of a headwind but it hasn't changed our outlook for the full year.\n\nOperator: We don't have any questions at the moment. I'd now like to hand back over to Ben for closing remarks.\n\nBenjamin Gliklich: Great. Thank you very much. Thanks to everybody for joining, and we look forward to seeing many of you soon. Have a good day.\n\nOperator: We would like to thank everyone for attending today's conference call. We hope that you have a wonderful day. Thank you, and you may now disconnect with the session.",

        "text": "Sahil Kumar found fame showcasing folk dances on TikTok, garnering more than 1.5 million followers – four years later, only 94,000 people follow him on Instagram\n\n‘It takes years to grow an audience on Instagram and especially on YouTube,’ Kumar said\n\nChoreographer Sahil Kumar found fame showcasing folk dances on TikTok, but his profile has been dormant since the video he posted four years ago supporting India’s decision to ban the platform.\n\nThe world’s most populous country offers a glimpse of what the social media landscape could look like in the United States next year, if a move to block local access to the Chinese-owned short video app goes ahead.\n\nSeveral local copycats tried to fill the void left by TikTok’s departure – prompted by a wave of nationalist fervour that followed a border clash between Chinese and Indian troops – but the biggest beneficiaries of the decision were YouTube and Instagram.It is difficult to recreate the success elsewhere, because I haven’t got the same engagement on any other platform\n\nKumar and many other content creators eventually flocked to those US-owned platforms, but few were able to replicate their earlier followings.\n\n“It is difficult to recreate the success elsewhere, because I haven’t got the same engagement on any other platform,” said Kumar, 30, from his studio in Rohtak, a short drive south of the capital New Delhi.\n\n“It takes years to grow an audience on Instagram and especially on YouTube,” he added.\n\nKumar was an engineer by training but ditched white collar work when he found an audience for his dance routines on TikTok, eventually garnering more than 1.5 million followers.\n\nHis new-found celebrity netted him paid opportunities to choreograph dance numbers for other influencers on the platform and music videos featuring Indian celebrities.\n\nBut his career was derailed in June 2020 after a deadly clash far from his home on the Himalayan frontier dividing India from China.\n\nTwenty Indian and four Chinese soldiers were killed in the encounter, the deadliest face-off between the two nuclear-armed neighbours in half a century, and two weeks later the app vanished from Apple and Google’s online stores.\n\nThe official government order mandating the removal made no reference to the incident or even China, only saying that TikTok had engaged in activities that were “prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India”.US Senate passes bill to force ByteDance to sell TikTok or face ban of the app\n\nKumar said in his final video on the platform that he agreed with the ban, urging those watching to follow him over to Instagram and YouTube.\n\n“They must have thought thoroughly before making this decision,” he said in a short speech to camera. “India comes first.”\n\nFour years later, just under 94,000 people follow him on Instagram – a tiny fraction of his earlier audience – and he laments that his chances to make money have dried up.\n\n“For us, the work stopped,” he said.\n\nTikTok arrived in India years after other established social media platforms, but quickly became a national phenomenon.\n\nA year before it was kicked out of the market, the platform said it had more than 200 million users in India – one out of every seven people in the country.\n\n“Every influencer, every personality trying to build an online following had to tap into the platform whether or not they liked it,” said Viraj Sheth, co-founder of influencer marketing agency Monk Entertainment.\n\n“As soon as we got the news of TikTok getting banned, everyone was helter-skelter.”These places have already banned TikTok\n\nSeveral local tech start-ups attempted to capitalise on TikTok’s disappearance by rushing their own short-form video apps to market.\n\nBut it was established US platforms that eventually proved best primed to triumph in the new market.\n\nIn the first year after the ban, Instagram saw about six million short videos from India posted each day to Reels, its own interface attempting to match TikTok’s content model.\n\nThat compared to 2.5 million videos posted each day to Indian video sharing platform Moj, according to local media reports.\n\nMarket tracker Statista estimates that more than 362 million people in India use Instagram and 462 million more use YouTube – which rolled out Shorts, its own

        "text": "As Apple gears up for its May event, whispers from Cupertino suggest we're in for an exciting unveiling of the new iPad Pro on May 7th. Apple is setting the groundwork for a breakthrough with what could be its first truly AI-powered device -- the iPad Pro equipped with the cutting-edge M4 chip and its robust neural engine.\n\nDesigner: Apple\n\nMark Gurman of Bloomberg suggests that the upcoming iPad Pro represents more than just hardware updates. We should expect to see a preview of Apple's ambitious AI chip strategy. This integration will significantly enhance AI capabilities, potentially including native Apple-developed tools and deeply integrated chatbots (think Siri on steroids) in partnership with OpenAI, thanks to recent but unconfirmed reports that Apple is back in talks with OpenAI.\n\nLet's not forget about the accessories! Rumor has it that the next Apple Pencil will have haptic feedback. This feature could be a game-changer for designers as it would allow them to feel the texture of what they're drawing on, such as the roughness of a canvas or the smoothness of glass, directly from their digital pen.\n\nThis feature is significant for those in design as it allows you to see and feel what you're drawing, making the use of digital tools more akin to using real pencils or brushes. This is particularly beneficial for anyone interested in aesthetics, such as graphic designers, UX designers, or even casual doodlers. It also offers practical advantages for 3D modeling and digital sculpture by enabling designers to feel textures and contours directly, which can lead to more precise and detailed creations. This tactile feature transforms the Apple Pencil from a simple stylus into an essential tool for artists, enhancing both the functionality and the overall creative experience.\n\nShifting the focus to Apple's smartphone lineup, the iPhone 16 series is also making headlines with leaked images revealing a new vertical camera setup designed to support spatial video recording -- perfect for playback on the Apple Vision Pro in stunning 3D. These leaks, courtesy of Sonny Dickson (via Forbes), show new aesthetic tweaks with new color options, including a chic violet.\n\nBut there's more brewing at Apple. The iPhone 16 is expected to introduce a new Capture Button, which will enhance the photography experience by double-acting as a focus and shutter button. This feature and last year's Action Button show Apple taking steps to improve user interactions through intuitive hardware updates.\n\nAs we approach these releases, everyone in the tech community is getting excited, and that definitely includes me. Will the new iPad Pro's AI capabilities redefine productivity? Will the iPhone 16's camera innovations set a new benchmark in mobile photography? Only time will tell.\n\nStay tuned for our ongoing coverage of all things Apple. Their next chapter promises to be as dynamic and innovative as ever, blending cutting-edge technology with sophisticated design to pioneer new territories in the tech landscape. You can catch the Apple event on May 7th by streaming it live on Apple's official website or through their YouTube channel, starting at 10:00 AM Pacific Time.",

From maps to emails, weather to health monitoring, phones do more than ever. So when something as central as an alarm clock isn't working properly, people notice. This is what is currently happening with the iPhone.\n\nAs noted by Joe Rossignol at MacRumors, there is a software bug on the iPhone that affects alarms in the Clock app. Some users find that the alarm clock does not work and therefore they wake up late.\n\nForbesiPad 2024 Latest Leak: Apple Could Reveal a Brand New iPad Accessory in a Few Days\n\nThere have been issues in the past, often related to the clock going back or a new year, for example, but the latest issues were reported on social media and have nothing to do with any of that.\n\nAn alarm clock is quite simple: you choose a time for it to wake you up and you are sure it will do so. But some users, as reported by Today Show on NBCcomplain that the iPhone doesn't play the wake-up sound it was asked for, leaving them oversleeping.\n\nForbesApple iPhone, iPad and Mac users stuck on their devices, reset required\n\nIt's very annoying, and the news affected Joanna Stern of the Wall Street Journal as the Today Show called it. However, she confirmed that her iPhone was working correctly and at the right time, saying in a post on, \"Today Show called me last night and told me the iPhone alarms weren't working! I hadn't heard this, but Apple confirmed this AM that it was aware of an issue preventing some alarms from sounding and was working on a fix. My iPhone alarm woke me up right on time at 6:50 a.m.! Does anyone have this problem? \"\n\nSo the good news is that Apple has confirmed that it is working on a fix for the problem.\n\nThe bad news is that we don't know enough about the problem to know for sure how big it is or how it manifests. We know that this doesn't affect everyone and that it only fails to play certain sounds, rather than all.\n\nWhich leaves no one feeling safe. Learn more about the update as we have it.",

        "text": "Barrick Gold Corp. ABX-T is being accused of using the virtual format for its annual general meeting to suppress critical questions from stakeholders.\n\nAfter holding a hybrid AGM last year that allowed stakeholders to show up in person, the Toronto-based gold mining company, which is the world's second biggest by market value, went to a virtual-only format this year.\n\nVirtual AGMs have attracted the ire of some shareholder-rights groups. In an open letter to members of the S&P/TSX 60 Index in April, a group of 38 institutional investors, advisers, portfolio managers and non-profits argued that online meetings can undermine shareholder rights, by allowing companies to cherry-pick questions, or change the wording of them.\n\nAfter concluding the administrative part of the AGM on Tuesday, Barrick chief executive Mark Bristow fielded a handful of queries from shareholders, proxy holders and guests that were submitted on a virtual chat portal.\n\nCatherine Coumans, Asia-Pacific co-ordinator with Mining Watch Canada, attended the virtual meeting. She submitted two probing questions about alleged police brutality at Barrick's North Mara gold mine in Tanzania, namely: \"How many people have been shot and wounded or killed by police contracted to the mine this year alone, and when will you stop the killing and stop contracting police to guard this mine?\" Ms. Coumans's questions were preceded by a succinct preamble outlining her rationale.\n\nAt the virtual meeting, Mr. Bristow was not read the preamble and not read the specific questions. He was simply asked by a Barrick representative to comment on allegations of human-rights abuses at North Mara.\n\n\"They did not read my questions,\" Ms. Coumans said in an interview. \"She just made it up,\" she added, referring to the Barrick staffer.\n\nMr. Bristow himself appeared puzzled at the lack of specifics from Ms. Coumans, and he immediately asked the moderator if there was more to the question.\n\nIn his reply, Mr. Bristow said he'd asked Ms. Coumans for evidence of the police brutality at North Mara, but that had not materialized. He concluded his answer by saying that he was \"a bit lost\" because he didn't know what question had been asked.\n\nMining Watch isn't the only party claiming it was given short shrift at Barrick's AGM.\n\nJan Morrill, tailings campaign manager for environmental activist group Earthworks, wrote in an e-mail to The Globe and Mail that a question asked by community members from Argentina that was critical of Barrick's Veladero mine in that country was ignored by Barrick.\n\nAnd another shareholder who asked a question on behalf of communities in the Dominican Republic about alleged contamination near a Barrick tailings dam claimed the question \"was significantly summarized\" and not answered adequately, Ms. Morrill said.\n\nBarrick did not respond to a request for comment for this story.\n\nThe Canadian gold miner also faced criticism for its conduct ahead of the virtual meeting.\n\nOne of the items that went in front of shareholders for a vote on Tuesday was a proposal for a third-party audit of the impact of Barrick's current and proposed mines on local water systems. The proposal was championed by Ekō, a Washington-based activist group whose objective is to rein in the power of large corporations.\n\nEkō said that rules should have permitted the group to give a presentation at the meeting to explain the need for the measure to bring further scrutiny to Barrick's water practices. But Ekō said that Barrick rejected the presentation it had recorded for the meeting and told it that a bare-bones reading of the proposal was all that would be permitted.\n\nLacey Kohlmoos, senior campaign manager with Ekō, said in a statement that she'd never heard of a company censoring a shareholder proposal presentation before. Ekō has presented proposals at shareholder meetings for Meta Platforms, Alphabet and Apple.\n\n\"Barrick Gold will do everything in its power to silence the voices of community members calling out the company for doing harm,\" she added.\n\nThe lack of a physical gathering for Barrick's AGM also meant that human-rights protesters didn't have an obvious location in which to gather, and any aggrieved stakeholders had no avenue in which to directly confront Barrick's board of directors.\n\nLast year, the in-person part of Barrick's AGM took place at the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto's financial district. It featured a heated discussion between Mr. Bristow and Lateef Johar Baloch, a Pakistani human-rights activist who raised questions about Barrick's Reko Diq project in the country.\n\n\"It was quite a dramatic exchange,\" Ms. Coumans said. \"I very much think that last year's experience made them decide, 'Hey, we don't want that any more.'\"\n\nDespite the lifting of most COVID-19 restrictions, virtual meetings are still extremely common in Canada.\n\nFifty-seven per cent of TSX 60 constituent companies held virtual-only meetings during the 2023 proxy season, up from 54 per cent in 2020, according to data supplied by Amandeep Sandhu of Sandhu ESG Law.",

Dominion Energy recommends contacting 811 before breaking ground on any gardening, landscaping, irrigation, or fence installation.\n\nSylvia White, Dominion's director of electric distribution operations centers, said the advice applies to residential and commercial digging as well.\n\nUnder Virginia law, contractors and property owners must call 811 at least two working days before the start of excavation.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nWhite said 811 can come to a residence and check the digging area. According to Dominion Spokeswoman Cherise Newsome, 811 will put color-coded flags in the ground to signify what kind of utility lines are underground in a yard.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The Common Ground Alliance reported 4,574 damages to the underground utilities in Virginia in 2022 and 4,147 in 2021. And nationally, Common Ground Alliance reports that a utility line is damaged every six minutes in the United States. And nearly a third of the outages result from a property owner failing to contact 811.\n\nWhite said the repairs can be done expeditiously if the worst happens and utilities are damaged. But the first step is to call Dominion or your energy provider when you dig and have experienced an outage, she said.\n\n\"The repair is done as soon as the cable is cut,\" she said. \"Within hours, the power is restored.\"\n\nHowever, White said prevention is a significant goal of Dominion Energy. \"Safeguarding our underground utilities is our No. 1 priority, with third-party damage posing the biggest threat,\" she said in a press release.\n\nBob Stuart (540) 932-3562\n\nrstuart@newsvirginian.com\n\n@oldyankee53 on Twitter\n\n0 Comments Tags Construction Industry Business The Economy Agriculture Gardening Electricity Job Market Trade Get local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSubscribe to our Daily Headlines newsletter.\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.

        "text": "Explore the latest revelations about TikTok's methods to bypass Apple App Store commissions, its implications for privacy, and the evolving app store policies.\n\nRecent developments suggest that TikTok may be leveraging complex software mechanisms to circumvent Apple's App Store commissions. This practice has prompted discussions about data privacy, security, and market fairness.\n\nThe Alleged Circumvention Strategy\n\nStudies indicate that TikTok has the capability to alter its app's functionalities dynamically, bypassing the static analysis usually performed by Apple and Google's app stores. This enables the app to operate more like a web browser, pulling data directly from servers and updating without typical app store checks. Such capabilities could potentially allow TikTok to sidestep the revenue-sharing model of app stores by facilitating transactions or data exchanges outside the monitored ecosystem.\n\nApp Store's Response\n\nApple has made adjustments to its policy, possibly in response to these practices. Developers can now inform users about purchasing options outside of the App Store ecosystem, a change influenced by legal challenges and antitrust concerns. However, Apple still imposes a commission on such transactions, though reduced after the first year, which could be seen as a move to maintain revenue while addressing competitive pressures.\n\nApple's Policy and the Legal Landscape\n\nApple's App Store, known for its stringent policies requiring a 30% commission on in-app purchases, recently faced legal scrutiny. The result of Apple's legal battle with Epic Games and subsequent changes allows developers to inform users about alternative purchasing options, albeit within a framework that still benefits Apple financially by imposing a new 27% tax on web purchases initiated through apps\n\nTikTok's Position\n\nDespite the scrutiny, TikTok maintains that its practices are compliant with global security standards and align with those of other social media platforms. The company emphasizes its commitment to user privacy and the ongoing efforts to secure its platform against evolving cyber threats .\n\nAs the digital marketplace evolves, the tension between app developers and platform owners like Apple will likely intensify. The case of TikTok could set precedents for how apps and digital services operate within the increasingly regulated and scrutinized app store environments.",

        "text": "Pro-Palestinian protesters settled into a portico of Millar Library on the Portland State University campus over the weekend, shown on Monday, April 29, 2024, in Portland, Ore. Permission was originally granted by President Ann Cudd, but the PSU president reversed course on Monday and saying it needs to come down because of health and safety hazards.\n\nBy CEDAR ATTANASIO, JAKE OFFENHARTZ and JONATHAN MATTISE - Associated Press\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Dozens of protesters took over a building at Columbia University on Tuesday, barricading entrances and unfurling a Palestinian flag from a window in an escalation of demonstrations against the Israel-Hamas war on college campuses nationwide. The school promised they would face expulsion.\n\nThe occupation at the campus in New York -- where protesters had shrugged off an earlier ultimatum to abandon a tent encampment Monday or be suspended -- unfolded as other universities stepped up efforts to end the protests. Police swept through some campuses, leading to confrontations and arrests. In rarer instances, university officials and protest leaders struck agreements to restrict the disruption to campus life.\n\nAnd as cease-fire negotiations appeared to gain steam, it wasn't clear whether those talks would inspire an easing of campus protests.\n\nProtesters on Columbia's Manhattan campus locked arms early Tuesday and carried furniture and metal barricades to Hamilton Hall, among several buildings that were occupied during a 1968 civil rights and anti-Vietnam War protest. Protest organizers posted on Instagram soon after midnight urging people to protect the encampment and join them at Hamilton Hall. A \"Free Palestine\" banner hung from a window.\n\nOn social media Tuesday, the protest group CU Apartheid Divest called the building Hind's Hall, honoring a young girl who was killed in Gaza under Israeli fire.\n\n\"Students occupying the building face expulsion,\" Columbia spokesperson Ben Chang said in a statement Tuesday. He said the university had given protesters a chance to leave peacefully and finish the semester, but that those who didn't agree to the terms were being suspended -- restricted from all academic and recreational spaces, allowed only to enter their residences, and, for seniors, ineligible to graduate.\n\n\"Protesters have chosen to escalate to an untenable situation -- vandalizing property, breaking doors and windows, and blockading entrances -- and we are following through with the consequences we outlined yesterday,\" he said.\n\nA CU Apartheid Divest spokesperson said at a news conference Tuesday afternoon that some students recently learned they had been suspended for protesting. She declined to give her name but said she is a Columbia graduate student who has been suspended and is not allowed back on campus.\n\nShe stressed that she was not a representative of the students who seized the administration building, but pledged that their commitment wouldn't waver, despite the risk to their educations and careers.\n\n\"We are willing to take on an extremely minor amount of risk compared to what the heroic people of Gaza are dealing with every single day,\" she said.\n\nLater, the tent encampment was quiet and nearly empty. A small band of protesters chanted behind the university's locked gates.\n\nAccess to the campus was limited to students living in the residential buildings and essential employees, with one access point into and out of campus. New York Police Department Chief Jeffrey Maddrey said officers won't enter Columbia's campus without the college administration's request or an imminent emergency.\n\nAmong students suspended by Columbia on Tuesday was Mahmoud Khalil, a lead negotiator before talks with the administration broke down over the weekend. His suspension letter -- which he shared with The Associated Press -- said he had refused to leave the encampment after prior warnings. Khalil said he had abided by the university's demand to vacate the lawn by the Monday afternoon deadline.\n\nProtesters have insisted they will remain in the hall until the university agrees to three demands: divestment, financial transparency and amnesty.\n\nIlana Lewkovitch, a self-described \"leftist Zionist\" student at Columbia, said it's been hard to concentrate on school for weeks, amid calls for Zionists to die or leave campus. Lewkovitch, who identifies as Jewish, said she wished the current pro-Palestinian protests were more open to people like her who criticize Israel's war policies but believe there should be an Israeli state.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"I did an exam yesterday, a final exam yesterday, and the background noise was 'say it loud, say it clear, we want Zionists out of here,'\" the neuroscience student who studied at Columbia's Tel Aviv campus said. \"I have a final due today and I have a final exam due tomorrow and I cannot go to the library.\"\n\nThe campus standoffs drew concern from the White House. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said President Joe Biden believes students occupying an academic building is \"absolutely the wrong approach,\" and \"not an example of peaceful protest.\" And Democratic New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said \"there must be accountability\" for the building takeover, \"whether that's disciplinary action from the school or from law enforcement.\"\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told reporters that \"it is up to the university authorities to have the wisdom to properly manage situations like the ones we have witnessed.\"\n\nAt California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt, where protesters occupied two buildings, dozens of police officers in helmets and carrying batons marched onto campus and cleared both overnight. The university said 25 were arrested and there were no injuries. The sweep was broadcast on the Facebook page of KAEF-TV, a satellite of KRCR-TV, until police detained the reporter.\n\nPresident Tom Jackson Jr. said in a statement that \"nobody wanted to see things come to this,\" but that \"serious criminal activity that crossed the line well beyond the level of a protest had put the campus at ongoing risk.\"\n\nCalifornia Senate President Pro Tempore Mike McGuire, whose district includes the campus, said damage there was estimated at more than $1 million.\n\nYale authorities cleared an encampment Tuesday morning after protesters heeded final warnings to leave, university officials said. No arrests were reported. Demonstrators said on social media that they were moving their gathering to a sidewalk. The encampment was set up Sunday, six days after police arrested nearly 50 people and took down dozens of tents.\n\nDozens of people were arrested Monday during protests at universities in Texas, Utah, Virginia and New Jersey.\n\nOn Tuesday, police cleared an encampment at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and detained about 30 people. Later, protesters replaced an American flag there with a Palestinian one. Police then rehung the American flag. Interim Chancellor Lee Roberts told reporters that removing the American flag was \"antithetical\" to the nature of the UNC community. Some students responded by shouting he was \"supporting the genocide of Palestinians.\" Classes were canceled Tuesday.\n\nAt the University of Connecticut, police made arrests after protesters refused to remove tents. The downtown campus of Portland State University in Oregon, where protesters had been demonstrating mostly peacefully until a small group broke into the library late Monday, was closed.\n\nThe nationwide campus protests began in response to Israel's offensive in Gaza after Hamas launched a deadly attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7. Militants killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took roughly 250 hostages. Vowing to stamp out Hamas, Israel has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, according to the local health ministry.\n\nIsrael and its supporters have branded the university protests as antisemitic, while Israel's critics say it uses those allegations to silence opposition. Although some protesters have been caught on camera making antisemitic remarks or violent threats, organizers of the protests, some of whom are Jewish, say it is a peaceful movement aimed at defending Palestinian rights and protesting the war.\n\nIn a rare case, Northwestern University said it reached an agreement with students and faculty who represent the majority of protesters on its campus near Chicago to allow peaceful demonstrations through the end of spring classes.\n\nMattise reported from Nashville, Tennessee. Associated Press journalists around the country contributed to this report, including Karen Matthews, Jim Vertuno, Hannah Schoenbaum, Sarah Brumfield, Stefanie Dazio, Christopher Weber, Carolyn Thompson, Dave Collins, Makiya Seminera, Philip Marcelo and Corey Williams.\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Columbia University has not canceled its main graduation event.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

        "text": "AP\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Witness testimony in Donald Trump's criminal trial advanced on Tuesday with three people taking the stand, including Keith Davidson, a lawyer who previously represented Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal in hush money negotiations involving the former president.\n\nDavidson's testimony dominated the afternoon, highlighting his interactions with Trump's ex-lawyer Michael Cohen and detailing the lead-up to a deal that ultimately came with a $130,000 payment to Daniels.\n\nTuesday's proceedings, however, kicked off with the judge holding Trump in contempt and fining him $9,000 over nine online posts that he found violated a gag order barring the former president from speaking publicly about jurors and witnesses in the case.\n\nMerchan warned that if Trump does it again, he could be jailed.\n\nWhen court resumes Thursday, another hearing will be held on four more alleged gag order violations.\n\nA New York state appeals court on Tuesday also rejected Trump's request for a stay of the trial while he appeals several pretrial rulings, including the trial judge's refusal to recuse himself.\n\nThe charges in the case center on $130,000 in payments that Trump's company made to Cohen. Prosecutors say Trump obscured the true nature of those payments and falsely recorded them as legal expenses.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.\n\nThe case is the first-ever criminal trial of a former U.S. president and the first of four prosecutions of Trump to reach a jury.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- Key players: Who's who at Donald Trump's hush money criminal trial\n\n-- The hush money case is just one of Trump's legal cases. See the others here\n\n-- Read the judge's full order on Donald Trump's gag order violations\n\n-- Trump and DeSantis meet to make peace and discuss fundraising for the former president's campaign\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nTRUMP HITS OUT AT GAG ORDER AS COURT ADJOURNS FOR THE DAY\n\nDonald Trump complained about the gag order in his hush money trial, as well as other things as he left the courthouse Tuesday following the adjournment of the day's proceedings.\n\nThe former president approached news cameras in the courthouse hallway on his way out and hit on familiar themes, including accusing Judge Juan M. Merchan of bias and of rushing the case, and also saying he should be out campaigning.\n\nTrump was found in contempt of court earlier in the day and fined $9,000 for nine violations of the gag order, which bars him from speaking publicly about witnesses and jurors in the case.\n\nDAVIDSON SAYS HE THOUGHT DANIELS' STORY WOULD 'BE A TORNADO' IF IT GOT OUT\n\nKeith Davidson and Dylan Howard, then-editor of the National Enquirer, texted each other about what Howard called an \"impending storm\" of publicity if Stormy Daniels took her story elsewhere after Michael Cohen failed to make a payment in the deal on time, according to Davidson's testimony and documents shown at the trial on Tuesday.\n\nDavidson wrote to Howard that he believed Daniels and her agent had agreed to bring her story about a sexual encounter with Donald Trump to another publication, and \"I think it'll be a full-on blitz.\"\n\n\"I just felt like there was going to be more than a flurry of activity. I felt like it was going to be a tornado,\" Davidson explained in court.\n\n\"If the story got out,\" Steinglass asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Davidson said.\n\nAsked if Cohen ever told him who he was representing in the Daniels negotiations, Davidson said that he may not have explicitly stated he was working on Trump's behalf -- but the implication was clear.\n\nCOHEN MISSED DEADLINE TO PAY $130K TO STORMY DANIELS, DAVIDSON SAYS\n\nBefore a brief afternoon break in Donald Trump's hush money trial, lawyer Keith Davidson testified Tuesday that Michael Cohen missed an agreed upon deadline for sending a $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels.\n\nAt first, Cohen offered a litany of explanations for the delay, at turns blaming broken computers, Secret Service \"firewalls,\" and the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur. \"The things he was saying didn't really make sense,\" Davidson said of Cohen.\n\nAs the excuses piled up, Davidson said he understood that Cohen \"didn't have the authority to actually spend money.\" He eventually sent an email informing Cohen that the deal involving Daniel's story about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump was off.\n\n\"I thought he was trying to kick the can down the round until after the election,\" Davidson said.\n\nAPPELLATE COURT REJECTS TRUMP'S REQUEST TO STAY HUSH MONEY TRIAL\n\nAs testimony continued in Donald Trump's hush money trial on Tuesday, a five-judge panel in New York state's mid-level appellate court rejected the former president's request for a stay of the proceedings while he appeals several pretrial rulings, including the trial judge's refusal to recuse himself.\n\nTrump had sought the stay prior to the start of jury selection. A lone judge in the appeals court had previously rejected a request for an emergency stay halting the trial.\n\nPSEUDONYMS WERE USED TO DISGUISE PARTIES INVOLVED IN ENQUIRER DEAL, LAWYER TESTIFIES\n\nIn drawing up the deal with the National Enquirer involving Stormy Daniels' story about an alleged sexual encounter with Donald Trump, Keith Davidson testified Tuesday that he used pseudonyms to disguise the parties involved.\n\nStormy Daniels became Peggy Peterson and Donald Trump became David Dennison, according to Davidson.\n\nThe alliterative code names were picked, in part, because Daniels was the plaintiff and Trump was the defendant, the lawyer testified.\n\nAsked by prosecutors in Trump's hush money case if David Dennison was a real person, Davidson said that he played on his high school hockey team.\n\n\"And how does he feel about you now?\" asked prosecutor Josh Steinglass.\n\nDavidson stifled a laugh, then answered: \"He's very upset.\"\n\n'MICHAEL COHEN STEPPED INTO AMI'S SHOES,' DAVIDSON SAYS\n\nStormy Daniels' agent reached a six-figure deal with then-National Enquirer editor Dylan Howard for the tabloid to acquire the rights to her story about a sexual encounter with Donald Trump after his \"Access Hollywood\" tape leaked, Keith Davidson testified Tuesday.\n\nBut then, according to Davidson, Howard backed out.\n\nThe editor instead told Daniels' agent, Gina Rodriguez, to call Michael Cohen and complete the deal directly with him -- but she refused to speak with Cohen after an uncomfortable prior interaction.\n\nRodriguez asked Davidson to step in and negotiate the deal with Cohen, the lawyer testified.\n\nDavidson added that he had numerous interactions with Howard over the years regarding stories. Asked if it was unusual for Howard to direct him to make a deal with a third party like Cohen, Davidson responded: \"This is the only time that ever happened.\"\n\n\"In essence, Michael Cohen stepped into AMI's shoes,\" Davidson said, referring to the name of the Enquirer's parent company at the time, American Media Inc.\n\nDavidson testified that in negotiating with Cohen, he hiked the price to $130,000 -- building in his fee for his work on the deal.\n\n'ACCESS HOLLYWOOD' TAPE LEAK MADE DANIELS' STORY MORE MARKETABLE, LAWYER SAYS\n\nStormy Daniels' story about a sexual encounter with Donald Trump became more marketable after the notorious \"Access Hollywood\" tape was leaked, Keith Davidson testified on Tuesday.\n\nDavidson, who previously represented Daniels, told prosecutors that Daniels' agent, Gina Rodriguez, had been trying to drum up interest in her story earlier in the 2016 election cycle but found there wasn't much.\n\nAsked to describe the \"Access Hollywood\" tape, which can't be shown in court, Davidson testified that it involved Trump and the show's then-host Billy Bush being recorded on a \"hot mic\" and \"some statements by both men that were troublesome.\"\n\n'HE WAS JUST SCREAMING,' LAWYER TESTIFIES OF FIRST INTERACTION WITH COHEN\n\nKeith Davidson on Tuesday testified that his first interaction with Michael Cohen related to a 2011 post on a gossip blog that stated that porn actor Stormy Daniels and Trump had \"some sort of physical or romantic interaction.\"\n\nAfter the blog post was published, Davidson said, Daniels' agent Gina Rodriguez called him and said, \"some jerk called me and was very, very aggressive and threatened to sue me.\"\n\nAsked who the \"jerk\" was, Davidson said: \"Michael Cohen.\"\n\nDavidson testified that when he called Cohen, the ex-Trump lawyer greeted him \"with a hostile barrage of insults and insinuations that went on for quite a while.\"\n\n\"I don't think he was accusing us of anything, he was just screaming,\" Davidson continued. \"Finally, after he finished, I explained to him that I was calling because my client, Stormy Daniels, did not want the story up. I wanted to see if he had done anything\" to try to get the story taken down.\n\nDavidson said he eventually sent a cease-and-desist letter to the blog after the dust up with Cohen and the story was removed.\n\nDAVIDSON SAYS HE UNDERSTOOD THE ENQUIRER WOULD NEVER PUBLISH MCDOUGAL'S STORY\n\nLawyer Keith Davidson testified on Tuesday that back-and-forth haggling took place in the selling of former Playboy model Karen McDougal's story to the National Enquirer.\n\nIn one text message shown to jurors, Davidson told Enquirer editor Dylan Howard that \"they are asking me to go back for another 25,\" meaning another $25,000. Howard responds with an expletive, adding, \"Not my money. I'll ask.\"\n\nBut even as they reached a basic framework for the deal, Davidson described his \"growing frustration with the process.\" At one point, Davidson said he was pushed to call Donald Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen directly, something he said he had been trying to avoid.\n\n\"I thought it was odd, certainly,\" Davidson said about being asked to call Cohen. \"I didn't particularly like dealing with him and that's why I was trying like hell to avoid talking to him,\" he added.\n\nDavidson testified that he understood McDougal's story would never be published and acknowledged that \"there was an unspoken understanding that there was an affiliation between David Pecker and Donald Trump and that AMI wouldn't run this story, any story related to Karen, because it would hurt Donald Trump.\"\n\nTRUMP'S ONLINE POSTS FOUND TO VIOLATE GAG ORDER HAVE BEEN REMOVED\n\nDonald Trump's online posts that on Tuesday were found to violate a gag order barring him from speaking publicly about jurors and witnesses in his criminal hush money trial were removed ahead of an afternoon deadline.\n\nThe posts in question were deleted while the court was in recess for lunch.\n\nLinks to the old Truth Social posts redirected to a \"Not found\" message, while those on Trump's website redirected to a 404 error page.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Judge Juan M. Merchan fined the former president $9,000 for the nine posts for violating the order.\n\nTEXAS AG PAXTON AMONG THOSE IN COURTROOM AS TRUMP'S TRIAL RESUMES\n\nCourt in Donald Trump's criminal trial resumed Tuesday after an early afternoon lunch break.\n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton walked into the courtroom with Trump and his entourage after posting on social media earlier in the day that he was there to support the former president. The Republican sat down in the first row of the courtroom gallery directly behind the defense table.\n\nPaxton sat just a few seats away from Trump's son Eric, who sat near the aisle alongside Susie Wiles, a Trump political operative.\n\nKeith Davidson, a lawyer who previously represented former Playboy model Karen McDougal and porn actor Stormy Daniels in hush money negotiations, was expected to returned to the witness stand.\n\nDAVIDSON SHEDS LIGHT ON SEQUENCE OF EVENTS THAT LED TO THE DEAL WITH THE ENQUIRER\n\nKeith Davidson testified Tuesday that after tipping off a National Enquirer editor about \"a blockbuster Trump story,\" he soon arranged a meeting with that editor, former Playboy model Karen McDougal and others to see whether the Enquirer's then-parent company was interested.\n\nAfter flying back to New York, Howard told him the Enquirer wasn't keen \"because Karen McDougal lacked documentary evidence of the interaction,\" Davidson testified.\n\nMcDougal had alleged that she had a year-long affair with Donald Trump years earlier.\n\nA month later, Enquirer editor Dylan Howard reached out again to Davidson, suggesting they resume discussions.\n\nAt the time, Davidson warned that the Enquirer's parent company would need to move quickly, writing in one text: \"Time is of the essence. The girl is being cornered by the estrogen mafia\"\n\nDavidson testified that McDougal was \"teetering\" at the time he sent the message and on the verge of signing a deal to tell her story to ABC News.\n\nDavidson also testified that he played the National Enquirer and ABC News against each other to get the best deal for his client. McDougal didn't want to tell her story publicly, which would've been required if she went to ABC, he said.\n\nJURY SEES TEXTS FROM LAWYER PROMISING TABLOID EDITOR A 'BLOCKBUSTER TRUMP STORY'\n\nIn his court testimony on Tuesday, attorney Keith Davidson described representing Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model, in her allegations of a year-long affair with Donald Trump.\n\nAs questioning turned toward Davidson's involvement in some of the hush money deals at the heart of the former president's criminal trial, he said he met McDougal 25 years ago through a friend. He said he started representing in 2016 \"to provide advice and counsel as to what her rights and obligations would be regarding a personal interaction that she had.\"\n\n\"With whom?\" prosecutor Joshua Steinglass asked.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"Donald Trump.\"\n\nShortly after Davidson began representing McDougal, he said, he reached out to Dylan Howard, the editor in chief of the National Enquirer, promising a \"blockbuster Trump story.\"\n\nHoward replied soon after: \"I will get you more than ANYONE for it. You know why.\"\n\nAs the text messages were displayed on screens to the jury, Davidson testified that he didn't know exactly what Howard meant at the time. But, he noted, \"I knew that Dylan's boss David Pecker and Mr. Trump were longtime friends and had a former business relationship,\" he said, adding the tabloid had effectively \"endorsed Mr. Trump's candidacy.\"\n\nSTORMY DANIELS' FORMER LAWYER CALLED TO THE STAND\n\nA lawyer who previously represented former Playboy model Karen McDougal and porn actor Stormy Daniels was the next witness called to the stand in Donald Trump's hush money trial.\n\nKeith Davidson took the stand shortly after noon Tuesday and is known for representing people trying to sell celebrity sex tapes or other embarrassing information.\n\nHe represented McDougal and Daniels in hush money negotiations with the National Enquirer and Trump's then-lawyer Michael Cohen in 2016.\n\nMcDougal claimed she had had a yearlong affair with Trump in the mid-2000s. Daniels claimed she had a one-time sexual encounter with him in 2006. Trump has denied both allegations.\n\nEXECUTIVE CA\n\nLLED TO THE STAND TO VERIFY TRANSCRIPT, VIDEO OF TRUMP DEPOSITION\n\nAn executive at a company that provides stenographers and videographers for depositions -- sworn, out-of-court statements under oath -- was the next witness called to the stand in Donald Trump's criminal trial on Tuesday.\n\nPhillip Thompson was called to authenticate a transcript and video of a deposition the former president gave in one of writer E. Jean Carroll's federal defamation lawsuits against him.\n\nThe portions included Carroll's lawyer asking Trump about his Truth Social platform, the dates of his marriage to wife Melania Trump and whether he was aware of the \"Access Hollywood\" tape.\n\nThe former longtime Elle magazine advice columnist had alleged that Trump sexually assaulted her in the 1990s and then defamed her after she came forward publicly in 2019. He has said nothing happened between the two of them and called her a \"wack job\" who engineered a \"hoax\" to sell a book.\n\nAfter two federal trials last year and this winter, juries awarded Carroll over $88 million. Trump is appealing.\n\nVIDEOS OF TRUMP DENYING ALLEGATIONS AND PRAISING COHEN PLAYED IN COURT\n\nProsecutors in Donald Trump's hush money case played C-SPAN clips on Tuesday of the then-presidential candidate on the campaign trail in the final weeks leading up to the 2016 election. In the videos, Trump forcefully denied allegations made by several women after his infamous 2005 \"Access Hollywood\" tape was made public.\n\n\"The stories are total fiction. They're 100% made up, they never happened, they never would happen,\" Trump said in video from an Oct. 14, 2016 rally in North Carolina.\n\nAnother clip played for the jury, from January 2017, showed Trump praising Michael Cohen as as good lawyer and friend.\n\nTrump did not appear to react in court to the clips, which were played on monitors throughout the courtroom, including directly in front of him on the defense table.\n\nAfter confirming the veracity of the clips, Robert Browning -- the executive director of C-SPAN's archives -- was dismissed from the witness stand. Trump's attorneys declined to question him.\n\nEXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF C-SPAN ARCHIVES CALLED TO THE STAND\n\nThe next witness called to the stand Tuesday in Donald Trump's hush money trial was Robert Browning, the executive director of the C-SPAN archives.\n\nBrowning, who manages the network's video collection, was called to verify the authenticity of video of a Trump campaign event.\n\nProsecutors are calling people who are regarded as \"records custodians\" to verify evidence in the former president's criminal case.\n\nTRIAL WILL BREAK FOR 4 DAYS OVER MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND\n\nDonald Trump's hush money trial will get an extra day off for the Memorial Day weekend next month.\n\nCourt won't be in session on Friday, May 24, to accommodate a juror who has a flight that morning, Judge Juan M. Merchan said on Tuesday.\n\nThat means the trial will be off for four straight days for the holiday weekend, resuming on Tuesday, May 28. Merchan also informed jurors there will not be court on May 17, though he didn't give them a reason.\n\nThat's the day Donald Trump will be attending his son Barron's high school graduation.\n\nPROSECUTORS WANT TO QUESTION TRUMP ABOUT GAG ORDER VIOLATIONS IF HE TESTIFIES\n\nAhead of a midday break in Donald Trump's hush money case, prosecutors asked the judge to let them question the former president about his gag order violations should he choose to testify.\n\nThe request came after Judge Juan M. Merchan ruled Tuesday morning that Trump had on nine occasions violated a court mandate barring him from speaking publicly about witnesses and jurors in the case. He ultimately fined Trump $9,000 and will hold another hearing Thursday on four more alleged gag order violations.\n\nProsecutors also requested permission to introduce evidence they said shows Trump orchestrated a \"pressure campaign and intimidation effort\" against Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels.\n\nColangelo said Trump's attorney opened the door to that evidence by seeking to undermine the credibility of the two witnesses in opening statements.\n\nMerchan did not immediately rule, but said, \"the door has been opened.\"\n\nHe previously ruled to allow prosecutors to challenge Trump's credibility by questioning him about a limited number of his recent legal setbacks if he ends up taking the witness stand.\n\nTrump has said he wants to testify, but is under no obligation to do so.\n\nNO RED FLAGS ABOUT COHEN'S ACCOUNTS AT THE TIME, FARRO SAYS\n\nIn his cross examination of banker Gary Farro on Tuesday, defense attorney Todd Blanche underscored that Michael Cohen made no mention that the accounts he opened in October 2016 had anything to do with deals involving then-presidential candidate Donald Trump or his company.\n\nIf Cohen had done so, \"I would have asked questions,\" Farro said.\n\nFarro noted that he might not have opened a bank account for Cohen if he'd been told it was for what's known as a shell corporation -- one that receives and sends out money but doesn't have an underlying business.\n\nBut Cohen, the banker said, told him the account was for a real estate consulting business.\n\nNothing about it raised \"any red flags to you?\" Blanche asked.\n\n\"Not based upon the answers I was given to the questions I asked,\" Farro said.\n\nFarro's testimony shed light on his role in helping Cohen open a bank account that was later used to process a $130,000 wire transfer to a lawyer for Stormy Daniels.\n\nDEFENSE BEGINS CROSS-EXAMINATION OF FARRO\n\nDefense attorneys began their cross-examination of Gary Farro, the prosecution's third witness in Donald Trump's hush money trial, by asking the banker to describe his relationship with Michael Cohen.\n\nFarro said he first met Cohen -- then serving as the former president's personal lawyer -- in person at a meeting in Trump Tower, but primarily communicated over the phone. Pushed by Todd Blanche, Farro acknowledged that Cohen wasn't always easy to work with.\n\n\"He was a challenging client because of his desire to get things done so quickly,\" Farro said. \"Ninety percent of the time it was an urgent matter.\"\n\nPROSECUTORS WRAP QUESTIONING OF FARRO\n\nProsecutors have wrapped up questioning of Gary Farro, their third witness in Donald Trump's criminal hush money trial.\n\nFarro told prosecutors on Tuesday that Michael Cohen had indicated that a 2016 $130,000 wire payment now at the heart of the case was related to a real estate transaction -- not a political candidate, an adult film performer or buying up a potential media story.\n\n\"We might consider something like that a reputational risk,\" Farro said.\n\nWithin a day of opening the Essential Consultants LLC bank account on Oct. 26, 2016 -- and funding it with about $130,000 from his own home equity loan -- Cohen wired out $130,000 to Keith Davidson, then a lawyer for Stormy Daniels, documents showed.\n\nThe 2016 presidential election was on Nov. 8.\n\nFAMILY JOINS TRUMP IN COURT FOR THE FIRST TIME\n\nDonald Trump's son Eric joined his father in court on Tuesday, marking the first time any of the former president's family members have attended his criminal hush money trial.\n\nPrior to court proceedings resuming, Trump turned from the defense table and walked over to his son in the first row of the gallery. Trump put his hand on Eric's arm as they chatted.\n\nTrump had railed about the trial, as well as his other legal cases, to reporters on his way into the courtroom earlier in the morning.\n\nFARRO RETURNS TO THE STAND\n\nTestimony in Donald Trump's hush money trial resumed with Gary Farro, a banker who helped Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen open accounts. Cohen used one such account to buy the silence of porn performer Stormy Daniels in the weeks before the 2016 election. She alleged a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump, which he denies.\n\nCohen indicated the account, opened in late October 2016 in the name of Essential Consultants LLC, would be used for real estate consulting, according to testimony and documents shown at the trial.\n\nIn response to prosecutor Becky Mangold's questions, Farro said the bank would have asked more questions if there had been any mention of a connection to a political candidate, buying a story that was being pitched to the media or paying a porn performer.\n\nThe additional scrutiny would have delayed or even nixed opening the account, which Cohen had wanted to open right away. In particular, the adult film world \"is an industry we don't work with,\" he said.\n\nWith only real estate in the picture, the account was opened within a day -- \"very quick,\" Farro said.\n\nMERCHAN FINDS POST ABOUT COHEN AND DANIELS WAS NOT A VIOLATION\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan found that one of Donald Trump's online posts about his former lawyer Michael Cohen and porn actor Stormy Daniels did not violate a gag order barring him from speaking publicly about jurors and witnesses in his hush money case.\n\nMerchan wrote that he was finding Trump \"in criminal contempt for willfully disobeying a lawful mandate\" of the court on nine separate occasions for posts made on Truth Social and his campaign website.\n\nMerchan ruled that Trump's April 10 post referring to Cohen and Daniels as \"sleaze bags\" was not a gag order violation. He said Trump's contention that he was responding to previous posts by Cohen \"is sufficient to give\" him pause \"as to whether the People have met their burden\" as to that post.\n\nHowever, the other nine \"attack the credibility of arguably two of the more high-profile witnesses in this case.\"\n\n\"To allow such attacks upon protected witnesses with blanket assertions that they are all responses to 'political attacks' would be an exception that swallowed the rule. The Expanded Order does not contain such an exception,\" Merchan wrote.\n\nJUDGE FINDS TRUMP VIOLATED GAG ORDER, FINES HIM $9K\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan ruled Tuesday morning that Donald Trump violated a gag order barring him from making public statements about witnesses and jurors in his hush money trial nine times. He fined the former president $9,000 for the violations.\n\nProsecutors had alleged the former president had violated the order 10 times, and Merchan concurred in all but one of those instances. The judge will hold a hearing Thursday on four more alleged violations.\n\nThe former president stared down at the table in front of him as Merchan read the ruling, frowning slightly but otherwise showing no expression.\n\nMerchan wrote in his ruling that Trump \"is hereby warned that the Court will not tolerate continued willful violations of its lawful orders\" and raised the possibility of jail time if \"necessary and appropriate under the circumstances.\"\n\nJUDGE TO ALLOW TRUMP TO ATTEND SON'S GRADUATION\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan said Tuesday morning that Donald Trump's criminal hush money trial will not be held on May 17 so that the former president can attend his son's graduation.\n\n\"I don't think the May 17 date is a problem, so Mr. Trump can certainly attend that date, attend his son's graduation,\" Merchan said.\n\nTrump had previously requested the day off from court to accommodate his son Barron's high school graduation.\n\nTRUMP ARRIVES AT COURT\n\nDonald Trump's motorcade arrived Tuesday morning at the courthouse in lower Manhattan just before 9 a.m., kicking off the second week of witness testimony in the former president's hush money trial.\n\nA crowd of around 60 Trump supporters had gathered across the street from the building, waving Trump and American flags on tall poles.\n\nTRUMP LEAVES TRUMP TOWER FOR COURT\n\nDonald Trump entered his motorcade outside Trump Tower in midtown, headed to the courthouse in lower Manhattan for the second week of trial testimony.\n\nThe former president on Tuesday will be in court for testimony from the third prosecution witness, Gary Farro, a banker who helped Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen open accounts.\n\nCohen used one to buy the silence of porn performer Stormy Daniels. She alleged a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump, which he denies.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

        "text": "Apple has poached dozens of artificial intelligence experts from Google to set up a \"secret European lab\" in Zurich to build new AI models and products, according to a paywalled Financial Times report. It is said to have accommodated a new staff team for the mission.\n\nApple has hired at least 36 experts from Google since 2018, when it hired John Gianandrea to become its top AI executive, based on an analysis of LinkedIn profiles conducted by the FT.\n\nApple's main AI team works in California and Seattle, but the company recently expanded an office dedicated to AI work in Zurich, Switzerland. Apple's acquisition of local AI startups FaceShift (VR) and Fashwell (image recognition) is believed to have influenced the decision to build a secret laboratory known as Vision Lab in the city.\n\nEmployees based at the lab have been involved in Apple's research into the underlying technology that powers OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot and similar products based on large-scale language models (LLMs), according to the report. The focus is on designing more advanced AI models that incorporate text and visual input to generate responses to queries.\n\nThe report suggests that Apple's recent work on LLM is a natural evolution of the company's work on Siri over the past decade.\n\nThe company has long recognized the potential of neural networks, a form of AI inspired by the way neurons interact in the human brain, and the technology behind breakthrough products such as ChatGPT. I did.\n\n\"Siri is a great tool for people who want to learn more about Siri,\" said Chuck Wooters, a conversational AI and LLM expert who joined Apple in December 2013 and worked on Siri for almost two years. \"One of the pushes that was happening within the Siri group while I was there was that they were big proponents of neural networks, even back in the day before large-scale language models were popular.\"\n\nApple's core AI group now includes prominent former Google talent, including Giannandrea, the former head of Google Brain, which is now part of DeepMind. Samy Bengio, who currently serves as Apple's senior director of AI and ML research, was also previously a lead AI scientist at Google. The same goes for Ruoming Pang, who leads Apple's \"Foundation Models\" team, which focuses on large-scale language models. Pan previously led AI voice recognition research at Google.\n\nIn 2016, Apple acquired Perceptual Machines, a company founded by Carnegie Mellon University's Ruslan Salakhutdinov that uses AI to generate image detection. Salakhatdinov is considered a key figure in the history of neural networks, having studied under the technology's \"godfather\" Jeffrey Hinton at the University of Toronto. Hinton left Google last year, citing concerns about the dangers of generative AI.\n\nSalakhutdinov told the FT that one reason for Apple's slow rollout of AI is that its language models tend to provide inaccurate or questionable answers. \" He said.\n\niOS 18 is rumored to include new generative AI features for Siri, Spotlight, Shortcuts, Apple Music, Messages, Health, Keynote, Numbers, Pages, and other apps. These features are expected to be enabled by Apple's on-device LLM, but Apple is also said to be discussing partnerships with his Google, OpenAI, and Baidu.\n\nThe first look at Apple's planned AI features is expected to be announced in a little over a month, with iOS 18 set to debut at the Worldwide Developers Conference starting June 10th.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online",

        "text": "Niche uses seven weighted factors for its rankings. A majority of the score is based on academics, but other factors include culture and diversity; sports; clubs and activities; resources; and surveys of parents, teachers, and students.\n\nEnrollment in Montana public schools declined across the board this academic year.\n\nData released Tuesday by the Office of Public Instruction puts the total number of K-12 students enrolled in Montana public schools at 148,585. That's a decrease of roughly 1.3% from 2022-2023. There are 821 public schools in the state.\n\nOver the last 30 years, the highest public school enrollment numbers were seen in the 1995-1996 school year. There were 164,627 K-12 students attending Montana public schools at that time.\n\nDeclines in enrollment for the current school year were most pronounced at the elementary level. Enrollment fell by 1.7%, whereas it dropped among higher schoolers by just 0.3%.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nUPDATED: Campus operations return to normal following UM shooting threat UPDATED: Candidate for head of Montana OPI charged with obstructing a peace officer Trump Jr. rallies GOP crowd in Missoula Data: Industrial plant in Missoula emits hundreds of tons of air pollutants each year Wood products closures have ripple effects on Montana's timber economy Missoula leaders talk building another town at the Wye, homelessness Pro-Palestine protest forceful but peaceful as Trump Jr. speaks at UM 250-home subdivision planned for East Missoula Missoula County looks to dissolve road plan for development in Wye area Pride flags can remain in MCPS classrooms, school board says State announces new program to help laid off mill workers City to impose new restrictions on White Pine Sash land on Northside '40 Over 40': Missoula dancers make moves, some for 1st time Updated: Helicopter crashes near Anaconda Smelter, lone pilot killed Man collapses during Riverbank Run, revived by bystanders and first responders\n\nElsie Arntzen, OPI superintendent, issued a statement attributing the declines to families moving out of state and a growing number of parents searching for an alternative to the public school system.\n\nWhile public school student numbers have fluctuated in the last three decades, still nearly 20,000 shy of its peak, non-public enrollment has steadily climbed. Non-public student enrollment captures both homeschooled students and private school students.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nIt surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, increasing by nearly 29%.\n\nThough the numbers have ticked down slightly, a total of 17,108 are still educated in either private or homeschool settings, an increase of 2.4% from 2022-2023. Homeschool accounted for the bulk of that increase. A total of 8,524 school-aged Montanans are being homeschooled this year, an increase of more than 9%.\n\nMontana's public school funding formula ties dollars to student headcount. A key part of the calculation to determine how much money a given school district will receive from the state's general fund -- called average number belonging -- is largely based on enrollment.\n\nFewer students mean fewer dollars for schools across the state already facing crippling budget crunches.\n\nPrevious reporting by Lee Montana noted how the changing composition of Montana's population in the last three decades has meant school-aged children account for a smaller share of all residents.\n\nWhile the overall population has soared, a shrinking percentage of kids and teenagers has led to enrollment declines. At its peak in the 1993-1994 academic year, K-12 school-aged children made up 20.3% of the state's population. As of 2022-2023, that had plummeted to 14.8%.\n\nSo long as much of the school funding formula is based on head counts, financial woes are likely to persist alongside enrollment declines.\n\n\"Like all Montana families, our public school districts are facing budget constraints due to increasing costs and inflation,\" Arntzen said in the statement. \"Montana schools must prioritize student learning in their budgets as this decrease leads to fewer state dollars.\"\n\n0 Comments You must be logged in to react.\n\nClick any reaction to login.

        "text": "Victoria Eavis\n\nThe final major filings were submitted recently in the kids' climate case that made international headlines last summer, and now the Montana Supreme Court will decide whether to rule on the briefs or set a date for oral arguments.\n\nMultiple people involved, including Attorney General Austin Knudsen, think the court will take up oral arguments, given the high profile of the case.\n\nThe latest filing came from the appellants -- Gov. Greg Gianforte and agencies under him including the Department of Transportation, the Department of Environmental Quality and the Department of Natural Resources and Conservation -- in reply briefs to the plaintiffs' opening brief, which they filed in March.\n\nThe reply briefs were largely similar (parties are not allowed to raise significant new arguments on appeal) to the arguments they made in their opening brief with the Supreme Court and the arguments they made before District Court Judge Kathy Seeley in the case they lost.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Her decision struck down a state law barring Montana agencies from considering the impacts of climate change when issuing those permits.\n\nJudge rules in favor of youth plaintiffs in Montana climate case\n\nSeeley served up the landmark ruling when she ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, a group of 16 Montana youth, and her decision was seen around the world as one of the most major court rulings for climate change activists in history.\n\nWhat appears to be most novel in the reply briefs from the state is the expansion on the argument that MEPA is merely \"a procedural statute that does not give agencies any authority to condition, modify, or deny permits,\" and therefore is the wrong document to have at issue in this case.\n\n\"These circumstances mean that appellees cannot fairly trace the MEPA limitation to appellees' so-called climate injuries, even if the focus ignores the minuscule physical connection attributable to Montana,\" attorneys for the appellants wrote in their reply brief.\n\nState files brief before Montana Supreme Court in kids' climate case\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe state reiterated the argument that plaintiffs lack standing because nullifying this specific clause of Montana law won't address the harm they've suffered from climate change.\n\nThe plaintiffs addressed this argument in their opening brief before the Supreme Court.\n\n\"As the trial record and district court's order make clear, this case is about harm to Montana's environment, natural resources, and climate (and consequently its children) caused by [greenhouse gas] pollution and climate change. The state's argument that the framers were not concerned with 'global issues' ... mischaracterizes the distinctly local environmental degradation and injuries at the center of this case,\" attorneys for the plaintiffs wrote.\n\nIn Seeley's decision, she wrote that \"Montana's (greenhouse gas) emissions and climate change have been proven to be a substantial factor in causing climate impacts to Montana's environment and harm and injury to the youth plaintiffs.\"\n\nThe state also wrote that addressing climate change is a job for the legislative branch, not the courts.\n\n\"At its core, the district court's decision suffers from the obvious, but misguided, desire to meaningfully address the frustrations and angst about climate change expressed by the young appellees. But the Legislature is the proper forum for airing the thorny, technical, and social issues raised by appellees, not the judiciary. Montana's unique constitutional provisions on the environment should not be the vehicle that substitutes litigation for legislative action,\" the reply brief read.\n\nMultiple environmental law scholars have taken issue with this separation of powers argument.\n\n\"If courts aren't the right branch of government to determine if an act of the Legislature is unconstitutional or constitutional, then what are they for?\" asked Jennifer Rushlow, dean of the Maverick Lloyd School for the Environment at the Vermont Law School.\n\nThe argument that the courts are stepping out of their bounds into legislative branch territory is one that has a gripped the Republican party over the last couple years in Montana. Conservatives recently launched a special select legislative committee in response to multiple decisions from the state's courts finding bills the Legislature passed unconstitutional.\n\nTensions in this case are still running high: Knudsen called the district court proceedings from last summer a \"rigged circus\" on Friday, the same day the state filed its reply briefs.\n\nIf the plaintiffs prevail in the state's high court, the decision will not act as \"binding legal precedent\" for other states, but \"it might give courts courage\" in future climate cases, Rushlow explained.\n\nVictoria Eavis is a reporter for the Montana State News Bureau.\n\n0 Comments You must be logged in to react.\n\nClick any reaction to login.

        "text": "Victoria Eavis\n\nThe final major filings were submitted recently in the kids' climate case that made international headlines last summer, and now the Montana Supreme Court will decide whether to rule on the briefs or set a date for oral arguments.\n\nMultiple people involved, including Attorney General Austin Knudsen, think the court will take up oral arguments, given the high profile of the case.\n\nThe latest filing came from the appellants -- Gov. Greg Gianforte and agencies under him including the Department of Transportation, the Department of Environmental Quality and the Department of Natural Resources and Conservation -- in reply briefs to the plaintiffs' opening brief, which they filed in March.\n\nThe reply briefs were largely similar (parties are not allowed to raise significant new arguments on appeal) to the arguments they made in their opening brief with the Supreme Court and the arguments they made before District Court Judge Kathy Seeley in the case they lost.\n\nPeople are also reading... Argument in bar led to chase, shooting of Billings man in truck, county prosecutors allege Billings man found dead in truck identified Arrest made in case of Billings man found dead in truck Yellowstone visitor, possibly drunk, allegedly kicked a bison in the leg, was injured Arrest made in case of missing Laurel woman who was found dead in February Shooting suspect killed by sheriff's deputies in Phillips County Stabbing of 17-year-old in Billings is now a homicide UPDATED: Candidate for head of Montana OPI charged with obstructing a peace officer Photo: Stabbing at St. Vincent de Paul Monday morning Update: Gunshot victim found in pickup being investigated as homicide National German Exam touts Billings' West High students as best in the nation Updated: Helicopter crashes near Anaconda Smelter, lone pilot killed Groundwater resources in West Billings studied as future development pushes in Traditional cyclists encounter new Yellowstone travel companions Billings man guilty of trying to kill three people in mobile home shooting\n\nSeeley originally ruled last August that the state is violating the plaintiffs' constitutional right to a \"clean and healthful environment\" -- Montana is one of a handful of states with this clause in its Constitution -- by not accounting for greenhouse gas emissions and climate change impacts when granting permits under the Montana Environmental Policy Act (MEPA). Her decision struck down a state law barring Montana agencies from considering the impacts of climate change when issuing those permits.\n\nJudge rules in favor of youth plaintiffs in Montana climate case\n\nSeeley served up the landmark ruling when she ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, a group of 16 Montana youth, and her decision was seen around the world as one of the most major court rulings for climate change activists in history.\n\nWhat appears to be most novel in the reply briefs from the state is the expansion on the argument that MEPA is merely \"a procedural statute that does not give agencies any authority to condition, modify, or deny permits,\" and therefore is the wrong document to have at issue in this case.\n\n\"These circumstances mean that appellees cannot fairly trace the MEPA limitation to appellees' so-called climate injuries, even if the focus ignores the minuscule physical connection attributable to Montana,\" attorneys for the appellants wrote in their reply brief.\n\nState files brief before Montana Supreme Court in kids' climate case\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe state reiterated the argument that plaintiffs lack standing because nullifying this specific clause of Montana law won't address the harm they've suffered from climate change.\n\nThe plaintiffs addressed this argument in their opening brief before the Supreme Court.\n\n\"As the trial record and district court's order make clear, this case is about harm to Montana's environment, natural resources, and climate (and consequently its children) caused by [greenhouse gas] pollution and climate change. The state's argument that the framers were not concerned with 'global issues' ... mischaracterizes the distinctly local environmental degradation and injuries at the center of this case,\" attorneys for the plaintiffs wrote.\n\nIn Seeley's decision, she wrote that \"Montana's (greenhouse gas) emissions and climate change have been proven to be a substantial factor in causing climate impacts to Montana's environment and harm and injury to the youth plaintiffs.\"\n\nThe state also wrote that addressing climate change is a job for the legislative branch, not the courts.\n\n\"At its core, the district court's decision suffers from the obvious, but misguided, desire to meaningfully address the frustrations and angst about climate change expressed by the young appellees. But the Legislature is the proper forum for airing the thorny, technical, and social issues raised by appellees, not the judiciary. Montana's unique constitutional provisions on the environment should not be the vehicle that substitutes litigation for legislative action,\" the reply brief read.\n\nMultiple environmental law scholars have taken issue with this separation of powers argument.\n\n\"If courts aren't the right branch of government to determine if an act of the Legislature is unconstitutional or constitutional, then what are they for?\" asked Jennifer Rushlow, dean of the Maverick Lloyd School for the Environment at the Vermont Law School.\n\nThe argument that the courts are stepping out of their bounds into legislative branch territory is one that has a gripped the Republican party over the last couple years in Montana. Conservatives recently launched a special select legislative committee in response to multiple decisions from the state's courts finding bills the Legislature passed unconstitutional.\n\nTensions in this case are still running high: Knudsen called the district court proceedings from last summer a \"rigged circus\" on Friday, the same day the state filed its reply briefs.\n\nIf the plaintiffs prevail in the state's high court, the decision will not act as \"binding legal precedent\" for other states, but \"it might give courts courage\" in future climate cases, Rushlow explained.\n\nVictoria Eavis is a reporter for the Montana State News Bureau.\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Law Legislation Ecology Organic Chemistry Politics Meteorology Medicine Non-criminal Law Sports Trade Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.

        "text": "Carly Graf\n\nEnrollment in Montana public schools declined across the board this academic year.\n\nData released Tuesday by the Office of Public Instruction puts the total number of K-12 students enrolled in Montana public schools at 148,585. That's a decrease of roughly 1.3% from 2022-2023. There are 821 public schools in the state.\n\nOver the last 30 years, the highest public school enrollment numbers were seen in the 1995-1996 school year. There were 164,627 K-12 students attending Montana public schools at that time.\n\nDeclines in enrollment for the current school year were most pronounced at the elementary level. Enrollment fell by 1.7%, whereas it dropped among higher schoolers by just 0.3%.\n\nPeople are also reading... Argument in bar led to chase, shooting of Billings man in truck, county prosecutors allege Billings man found dead in truck identified Arrest made in case of Billings man found dead in truck Yellowstone visitor, possibly drunk, allegedly kicked a bison in the leg, was injured Arrest made in case of missing Laurel woman who was found dead in February Shooting suspect killed by sheriff's deputies in Phillips County Stabbing of 17-year-old in Billings is now a homicide UPDATED: Candidate for head of Montana OPI charged with obstructing a peace officer Photo: Stabbing at St. Vincent de Paul Monday morning Update: Gunshot victim found in pickup being investigated as homicide National German Exam touts Billings' West High students as best in the nation Updated: Helicopter crashes near Anaconda Smelter, lone pilot killed Groundwater resources in West Billings studied as future development pushes in Traditional cyclists encounter new Yellowstone travel companions Billings man guilty of trying to kill three people in mobile home shooting\n\nElsie Arntzen, OPI superintendent, issued a statement attributing the declines to families moving out of state and a growing number of parents searching for an alternative to the public school system.\n\nWhile public school student numbers have fluctuated in the last three decades, still nearly 20,000 shy of its peak, non-public enrollment has steadily climbed. Non-public student enrollment captures both homeschooled students and private school students.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nIt surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, increasing by nearly 29%.\n\nThough the numbers have ticked down slightly, a total of 17,108 are still educated in either private or homeschool settings, an increase of 2.4% from 2022-2023. Homeschool accounted for the bulk of that increase. A total of 8,524 school-aged Montanans are being homeschooled this year, an increase of more than 9%.\n\nMontana's public school funding formula ties dollars to student headcount. A key part of the calculation to determine how much money a given school district will receive from the state's general fund -- called average number belonging -- is largely based on enrollment.\n\nFewer students mean fewer dollars for schools across the state already facing crippling budget crunches.\n\nPrevious reporting by Lee Montana noted how the changing composition of Montana's population in the last three decades has meant school-aged children account for a smaller share of all residents.\n\nWhile the overall population has soared, a shrinking percentage of kids and teenagers has led to enrollment declines. At its peak in the 1993-1994 academic year, K-12 school-aged children made up 20.3% of the state's population. As of 2022-2023, that had plummeted to 14.8%.\n\nSo long as much of the school funding formula is based on head counts, financial woes are likely to persist alongside enrollment declines.\n\n\"Like all Montana families, our public school districts are facing budget constraints due to increasing costs and inflation,\" Arntzen said in the statement. \"Montana schools must prioritize student learning in their budgets as this decrease leads to fewer state dollars.\"\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags School Systems The Economy Education Finance Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.

        "text": "We know that AI is coming to the iPhone but exactly what will be included is still a secret. But a new leak suggests that the core web browser on the iPhone, Safari, is about to reap the benefits of AI capabilities.\n\nAs reported by AppleInsider, the introduction of artificial intelligence will bring tweaks to how the user interface is deployed, for instance. The new updates will be touched on at the upcoming World Wide Developers Conference, for sure, but Safari looks likely to also include advanced blocking features for unwanted content.\n\nThis fits with how Apple has been prioritizing privacy in recent years, making it hard or impossible for apps to track users' activities, for instance. This will lead to something called Web Eraser, the report claims, saying, \"As its name would imply, it's designed to allow users to remove, or erase, specific portions of web pages...The feature is expected to build upon existing privacy features within Safari and will allow users to erase unwanted content from any webpage of their choosing. Users will have the option to erase banner ads, images, text or even entire page sections, all with relative ease.\"\n\nThis sounds highly attractive to users -- though less so to advertisers. And since the blocking will be \"persistent\" rather than limited to one session, the browser will remember your choices even after you've closed the original web session.\n\nIt will allow users to revert changes if they want to.\n\nThere'll also be a cool new feature called Intelligent Search, the report says. It will offer new page controls menu and, the report says, \"The menu consolidates -- and provides quick access to -- old and new page control tools, among them being the browser's new 'Intelligent Search' feature.\"\n\nAccording to the report, this feature will leverage on-device, rather than in-the-cloud AI technology, keeping privacy and security front-and-center for the browser. It will identify topics and key phrases within a web page to allow text summaries.\n\nThe introduction of AI will also bring new page control menus to provide easy access to options that were previously \"located across different menus and the Share Sheet.\"\n\nIt should mean that options to zoom in and out, settings for privacy controls, content blocking choices and more should be easier to find and use.\n\nAnd after that, in 2025, there could be more powerful visual search features coming, with the report saying, \"People familiar with the tool say it's similar to the Visual Lookup feature, through which Siri can identify plants, pets and landmarks from photos.",

        "text": "OMAHA -- As Omaha Mayor Jean Stothert prepared to give an update on storm cleanup Monday afternoon, Tim Anderson and Russ Wilt backed a trailer full of branches to a growing pile of tree debris at Greenbriar Park in Elkhorn.\n\nThe branches came from Ramblewood, a neighborhood ravaged by Friday's tornado. This was the fifth trailer load that Anderson and Wilt dropped off Monday. Their employer, DTN, gave them the day off to serve the community -- but it wasn't Anderson's only contribution to the cleanup. On Sunday, he and his daughter, Ava, had picked up seven trailer loads.\n\nThroughout eastern Nebraska and western Iowa, both volunteers and paid workers continued to clean up after Friday's storms. So many people have been willing to help that, in some cases, officials have urged the public to back off.\n\nAuthorities in Pottawattamie County asked Monday that no groups or individuals travel to Minden, Iowa, to help with recovery efforts unless they have received prior approval. A tornado that hit Minden destroyed about 80 houses, including the home of Nicholas Ring, 63, who died Saturday at an Omaha hospital from his injuries.\n\nPeople are also reading...

This will allow the ability to purchase goods that match the needs identified by disaster survivors seeking assistance.\n\nDonations can be made to the Southwest Iowa Emergency Relief Fund to support areas impacted throughout the region at southwest-iowa-relief-fund. If you wish to have your donation designated to the community of Minden, a special fund is being established and information on how to make that donation will be announced in the coming days.\n\nIn Nebraska, Gov. Jim Pillen also urged financial support. For now, he said, the best way to help is to donate money to organizations helping displaced families. Plenty of volunteers worked on the cleanup over the weekend, he said. But he predicted there will be a need for volunteers throughout the summer and fall to continue the work of cleanup and rebuilding.\n\nVolunteers interested in providing cleanup assistance should contact Omaha Rapid Response, https://rapidresponseamerica.org/. That organization is helping to coordinate volunteer efforts in Elkhorn and many other areas.\n\nWashington County residents in need of volunteer assistance with cleanup or other debris removal services can report to the Salvation Army at the Lakeland Community Center located at County Road 34 and Nebraska 133. Volunteers may apply for work details at that location from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. daily until further notice.\n\nDonations of clothing, shoes, food or other personal items may be taken to the First Lutheran Church at 2146 Wright St. in Blair. The Red Cross is helping facilitate these donations with the church.\n\nHelp 'shows what community really means'\n\nAt Elkhorn's Greenbriar Park on Monday, Anderson said he was glad to be part of the effort. He recalled that he had wanted to help with the cleanup after Omaha's notorious 1975 tornado, but he was just 14 at the time and his father wouldn't let him. So he had extra motivation to help out this time.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"We're just helping out, just doing what we can to help our neighbors,\" said Anderson, whose own Elkhorn-area home escaped damage Friday.\n\nAs Anderson and Wilt tossed branches with help from City of Omaha worker Nick Flynn, they marveled at how many volunteers were working over the weekend.\n\n\"There would be like 40 people in a line carrying stuff and tossing it into a pile to be hauled away,\" Wilt said.\n\nStothert lauded the myriad volunteers as well as first responders and other city workers.\n\n\"It just really shows what community really means,\" she said. \"It's people coming together and helping each other. So many volunteers were out there. . . . In fact, in some areas there were more volunteers than we really knew what to do with.\"\n\nCleanup operations are progressing, Stothert said. The city provided the free tree debris site and a dumpsite for storm-damaged appliances at Greenbriar Park, and 10 city dump trucks in the Ramblewood area are helping people pick up construction debris so the city can haul it away.\n\nMeanwhile, Waste Management has extended its hours of operation at the Pheasant Point Landfill, 13505 N. 216th St. in Bennington, until 6 p.m. every day through Saturday, according to a spokeswoman for Douglas County.\n\nTo be accepted at the landfill, tree limbs must be cut into pieces that are 4 feet or smaller. The debris can be mixed.\n\nHousehold appliances, waste tires and hazardous materials, such as waste oil, paint in liquid, lead-acid batteries are not accepted. Dried-out paint can be accepted.\n\nCity officials are already looking ahead to reconstruction.\n\n\"Our message to everybody that was really affected is what the city wants to do is to help them get back in their houses as soon as possible,\" Stothert said.\n\nShe said the city plans to waive any type of city permit fees for people rebuilding after the storm.\n\n\"We will try to prioritize any type of permits and inspections that we can,\" Stothert said. \"But the one thing we want to put out a warning about is, don't fall for some scammers that have already come into town that will say (they) can get the job done without a permit. Because those permits and inspections are really important. They're all about safety.\"\n\nAs Stothert's press conference wrapped up, James Johnson and his son Braylen backed up their pickup truck with a load of tree debris from their neighborhood, Arbor Ridge, and nearby Ramblewood.\n\nIt's great that people are pulling together, James Johnson said.\n\n\"You just come together as a community,\" he said. \"That's what we do in the Midwest.

In the case of Mr. Carpenter's Roosevelt's elk, those differences resulted in an increase in score.\"\n\nCarpenter killed the bull on Sept. 21, 2023, in Humboldt County, California. Carpenter's elk smashes the previous world's record of 419-6/8 points taken by Rick Bailey in British Columbia in 2015. No stranger to big elk, Carpenter has multiple Roosevelt's elk in the records, including a 2011 bull that scored 398-1/8, which is the current archery world's record.\n\nPeople are also reading...

As a way to evaluate the success of conservation efforts the Club began keeping records in the 1920s and released the first record book in 1932.\n\nBefore Carpernter's entry could be made official, Boone and Crockett Club procedures require that the final score of a potential World's Record be verified by either an Awards Program Judges Panel or a Special Judges Panel. In this case, the Club held a Special Judges Panel in Verdi, Nevada.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | Montana Untamed\n\nCarpenter, 39, splits his work between guiding elk hunters in the fall and working as a wildlife biologist in the spring. He rarely gets a day to hunt for himself, but he is able to get out in the field often.\n\n\"It is very rewarding to be part of any successful Roosevelt's elk hunt,\" Carpenter said. \"It is that much more rewarding when we are able to take animals that are mature -- or even past their prime -- and are Boone and Crockett animals.\"\n\nRoosevelt's elk are one of three subspecies of North American elk for which the Boone and Crockett Club keeps records. Named after Club founder Theodore Roosevelt, Roosevelt's elk are found exclusively in the Pacific Northwest, ranging from northern California up through British Columbia's mainland and into Alaska.\n\nThey are the biggest elk subspecies, with bulls weighing as much as 1,100 pounds. Carpenter estimates the bull was 11 or 12 years old.\n\n\"It was probably from a combination of great genetics, perfect environmental conditions, and lots of late rain providing great forage for finishing out antler growth.\"\n\n\"Every animal is a trophy,\" says Tony A. Schoonen, chief executive officer of the Boone and Crockett Club. \"Sometimes, truly magnificent animals are taken that represent North America's conservation success story. That's really what we're celebrating.\"\n\nThe Boone and Crockett Club is headquartered in Missoula.\n\n0 Comments You must be logged in to react.\n\nClick any reaction to login.

Permission was originally granted by President Ann Cudd, but the PSU president reversed course on Monday and saying it needs to come down because of health and safety hazards.\n\nBy CEDAR ATTANASIO, JAKE OFFENHARTZ and JONATHAN MATTISE - Associated Press\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Dozens of protesters took over a building at Columbia University on Tuesday, barricading entrances and unfurling a Palestinian flag from a window in an escalation of demonstrations against the Israel-Hamas war on college campuses nationwide. The school promised they would face expulsion.\n\nThe occupation at the campus in New York -- where protesters had shrugged off an earlier ultimatum to abandon a tent encampment Monday or be suspended -- unfolded as other universities stepped up efforts to end the protests. Police swept through some campuses, leading to confrontations and arrests. In rarer instances, university officials and protest leaders struck agreements to restrict the disruption to campus life.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Protest organizers posted on Instagram soon after midnight urging people to protect the encampment and join them at Hamilton Hall. A \"Free Palestine\" banner hung from a window.\n\nOn social media Tuesday, the protest group CU Apartheid Divest called the building Hind's Hall, honoring a young girl who was killed in Gaza under Israeli fire.\n\n\"Students occupying the building face expulsion,\" Columbia spokesperson Ben Chang said in a statement Tuesday. He said the university had given protesters a chance to leave peacefully and finish the semester, but that those who didn't agree to the terms were being suspended -- restricted from all academic and recreational spaces, allowed only to enter their residences, and, for seniors, ineligible to graduate.\n\n\"Protesters have chosen to escalate to an untenable situation -- vandalizing property, breaking doors and windows, and blockading entrances -- and we are following through with the consequences we outlined yesterday,\" he said.\n\nA CU Apartheid Divest spokesperson said at a news conference Tuesday afternoon that some students recently learned they had been suspended for protesting. She declined to give her name but said she is a Columbia graduate student who has been suspended and is not allowed back on campus.\n\nShe stressed that she was not a representative of the students who seized the administration building, but pledged that their commitment wouldn't waver, despite the risk to their educations and careers.\n\n\"We are willing to take on an extremely minor amount of risk compared to what the heroic people of Gaza are dealing with every single day,\" she said.\n\nLater, the tent encampment was quiet and nearly empty. A small band of protesters chanted behind the university's locked gates.\n\nAccess to the campus was limited to students living in the residential buildings and essential employees, with one access point into and out of campus. New York Police Department Chief Jeffrey Maddrey said officers won't enter Columbia's campus without the college administration's request or an imminent emergency.\n\nAmong students suspended by Columbia on Tuesday was Mahmoud Khalil, a lead negotiator before talks with the administration broke down over the weekend. His suspension letter -- which he shared with The Associated Press -- said he had refused to leave the encampment after prior warnings. Khalil said he had abided by the university's demand to vacate the lawn by the Monday afternoon deadline.\n\nProtesters have insisted they will remain in the hall until the university agrees to three demands: divestment, financial transparency and amnesty.\n\nIlana Lewkovitch, a self-described \"leftist Zionist\" student at Columbia, said it's been hard to concentrate on school for weeks, amid calls for Zionists to die or leave campus. Lewkovitch, who identifies as Jewish, said she wished the current pro-Palestinian protests were more open to people like her who criticize Israel's war policies but believe there should be an Israeli state.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"I did an exam yesterday, a final exam yesterday, and the background noise was 'say it loud, say it clear, we want Zionists out of here,'\" the neuroscience student who studied at Columbia's Tel Aviv campus said. \"I have a final due today and I have a final exam due tomorrow and I cannot go to the library.\"\n\nThe campus standoffs drew concern from the White House. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said President Joe Biden believes students occupying an academic building is \"absolutely the wrong approach,\" and \"not an example of peaceful protest.\" And Democratic New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said \"there must be accountability\" for the building takeover, \"whether that's disciplinary action from the school or from law enforcement.\"\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told reporters that \"it is up to the university authorities to have the wisdom to properly manage situations like the ones we have witnessed.\"\n\nAt California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt, where protesters occupied two buildings, dozens of police officers in helmets and carrying batons marched onto campus and cleared both overnight. The university said 25 were arrested and there were no injuries. The sweep was broadcast on the Facebook page of KAEF-TV, a satellite of KRCR-TV, until police detained the reporter.\n\nPresident Tom Jackson Jr. said in a statement that \"nobody wanted to see things come to this,\" but that \"serious criminal activity that crossed the line well beyond the level of a protest had put the campus at ongoing risk.\"\n\nCalifornia Senate President Pro Tempore Mike McGuire, whose district includes the campus, said damage there was estimated at more than $1 million.\n\nYale authorities cleared an encampment Tuesday morning after protesters heeded final warnings to leave, university officials said. No arrests were reported. Demonstrators said on social media that they were moving their gathering to a sidewalk. The encampment was set up Sunday, six days after police arrested nearly 50 people and took down dozens of tents.\n\nDozens of people were arrested Monday during protests at universities in Texas, Utah, Virginia and New Jersey.\n\nOn Tuesday, police cleared an encampment at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and detained about 30 people. Later, protesters replaced an American flag there with a Palestinian one. Police then rehung the American flag. Interim Chancellor Lee Roberts told reporters that removing the American flag was \"antithetical\" to the nature of the UNC community. Some students responded by shouting he was \"supporting the genocide of Palestinians.\" Classes were canceled Tuesday.\n\nAt the University of Connecticut, police made arrests after protesters refused to remove tents. The downtown campus of Portland State University in Oregon, where protesters had been demonstrating mostly peacefully until a small group broke into the library late Monday, was closed.\n\nThe nationwide campus protests began in response to Israel's offensive in Gaza after Hamas launched a deadly attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7. Militants killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took roughly 250 hostages. Vowing to stamp out Hamas, Israel has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, according to the local health ministry.\n\nIsrael and its supporters have branded the university protests as antisemitic, while Israel's critics say it uses those allegations to silence opposition. Although some protesters have been caught on camera making antisemitic remarks or violent threats, organizers of the protests, some of whom are Jewish, say it is a peaceful movement aimed at defending Palestinian rights and protesting the war.\n\nIn a rare case, Northwestern University said it reached an agreement with students and faculty who represent the majority of protesters on its campus near Chicago to allow peaceful demonstrations through the end of spring classes.\n\nMattise reported from Nashville, Tennessee. Associated Press journalists around the country contributed to this report, including Karen Matthews, Jim Vertuno, Hannah Schoenbaum, Sarah Brumfield, Stefanie Dazio, Christopher Weber, Carolyn Thompson, Dave Collins, Makiya Seminera, Philip Marcelo and Corey Williams.\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Columbia University has not canceled its main graduation event.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Bloomberg reportedon April 18 that Apple Inc. had removed at least four social media services from its Chinese App Store, including two Meta-owned apps. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which Bloomberg called \"one of the world's most rigid internet censorship regimes,\" demanded that Apple remove the apps over alleged \"national security\" concerns. Apple complied just after President Joe Biden signed a bill forcing TikTok to either relinquish its Chinese communist government ties or leave the country. The process of both bans have been ongoing, however.\n\nBloomberg explained, \"The orders come on the heels of a cleanup program Chinese regulators initiated in 2023 that was expected to remove many defunct or unregistered apps from domestic iOS and Android stores.\" Mobile app developers were reportedly required to complete registration with the CCP by the end of March or be forced to cease operating. The censored apps are Meta's Threads and WhatsApp, along with Signal and Telegram.\n\nIn a statement obtained by Bloomberg, Apple claimed that it disagreed with the CCP's demands but had to follow them. \"We are obligated to follow the laws in the countries where we operate, even when we disagree. The Cyberspace Administration of China ordered the removal of these apps from the China storefront based on their national security concerns,\" Apple stated, per Bloomberg. \"These apps remain available for download on all other storefronts where they appear.\"\n\nThe dictatorial CCP's \"Great Firewall\" has long banned foreign social media apps, including Facebook and Twitter (now X). Asia-Pacific news site The Diplomat, noted that Chinese users can be sentenced to years in prison for criticizing CCP officials.\n\nAmerican companies' operations in Communist China continue to be controversial, as do the operations of Chinese companies in America. President Joe Biden signed a bill a week ago that gives TikTok's Chinese parent company ByteDance a choice between selling TikTok or having the popular app banned. The CCP owns a board seat and maintains a financial stake in ByteDance, and multiple reports claim Chinese employees have access to U.S. TikTok user data, raising national security concerns.\n\nConservatives are under attack!

        "text": "Pennsylvania is taking steps toward becoming the latest state to punish someone for using a Bluetooth-connected device to track someone without their permission\n\nHARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Pennsylvania took a step Tuesday toward becoming the latest state to punish someone for using a Bluetooth-connected device to track someone without their permission.\n\nThe state House of Representatives voted 199-1 to approve legislation that would make using a tracking device to secretly track another person part of Pennsylvania's laws against stalking. The crime would be punishable as a third-degree misdemeanor, or up to 90 days in jail.\n\nThe bill goes to the Senate, where a separate bill is pending that would make the crime a second-degree misdemeanor, or punishable by up to two years in jail.\n\nMost states have a provision in state law that prohibits remote tracking, while others are adding it. Ohio is considering such legislation, Florida is increasing penalties for using such a device and Kentucky approved a new law last year.\n\nBluetooth-controlled devices made by various tech giants or digital apps installed on a mobile phone can secretly track the movements of another person.\n\nThe House bill's passage Tuesday comes a few weeks after a federal judge denied Apple's motion to dismiss a class-action lawsuit contending that the tech giant hasn't done enough to prevent stalkers from using its AirTag devices to track victims.\n\nApple's $29 AirTags have become popular items since their 2021 release, helping users keep tabs on the location of anything from lost keys to wallets and luggage.\n\nBut stalkers have also taken advantage of AirTags and similar tracking devices, and dozens of plaintiffs sued Apple in 2022, contending that AirTag users had stalked them. They said its safety features are inadequate and that Apple should have done more to protect victims after AirTags \"revolutionized the scope, breadth, and ease of location-based stalking.\"\n\nApple has condemned any malicious use of the product. It argued in court that it \"took proactive steps\" to deter misuse and that it shouldn't be liable for damage caused by third parties.\n\nLast year, Apple partnered with Google to set standards for fighting secret surveillance with tracking devices.",

The additional investors include Bpifrance, Frst Capital, Motier Ventures, Partech, and InstaDeep CEO Karim Beguir.\n\nFlexAI unlocks access to more computing and increased efficiency, with fewer challenges for developers. Delivered through an on-demand cloud service, FlexAI's universal AI compute enables developers to seamlessly build and train AI applications with heterogeneous compute architectures. The company is rearchitecting compute infrastructure to accelerate breakthroughs made possible by advancements in AI.\n\nFlexAI addresses the three main obstacles inhibiting AI innovation: a compute supply bottleneck, a global skills shortage, and unreliable processes for building and deploying AI models. And the company is creating an entirely new layer of software intelligence, abstraction, and orchestration into the AI compute stack, enabling developers to utilize multiple hardware configurations without arduous code changes. This expands access for compute, efficiently running AI workloads at lower costs than traditional GPU clusters, and making it easier to build AI applications.\n\nFlexAI works with hardware leaders and cloud providers in the AI ecosystem, including AMD, Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Intel, and NVIDIA, as well as key companies developing AI models and products. The company will unveil its first commercial product later this year: an on-demand cloud service that connects developers to virtual heterogeneous computing, enabling them to run their workloads on various architectures to build and deploy AI models reliably and efficiently.\n\nLaunched and founded by former Apple, Intel, NVIDIA, Tesla, Lifen, and Zoox veterans Brijesh Tripathi and Dali Kilani, the FlexAI team combines deep experience in both hardware and software to build full-stack solutions to the AI computing crisis.\n\nKEY QUOTES:\n\n\"We believe in AI's transformative power to solve some of humanity's biggest problems, but it will require a 1000x magnitude more compute to be able to realize this vision. The availability of AI compute today is limited to a select few. Our vision is to unlock access to compute for the many.\"\n\n\"AI is advancing in more directions than our current compute ecosystem can support. FlexAI has created a novel technology that opens access to diverse compute, supports a wide range of workloads, and accelerates innovation across the industry.\"",

Blending personal crowdfunding with the interactive storytelling of modern social networks, Wishew targets a broad demographic (ages 18-55) with a novel approach to achieving personal desires, ranging from life goals to bucket-list adventures. This socially-driven app fosters connections among like-minded individuals and cultivates a sense of community.\n\nWishew is ushering in a new era in social networking, dedicated to fulfilling dreams, supporting aspirations, and making incredible new friendships. By creating the first community for personal fulfillment and establishing the leading network for lifestyle enthusiasts, Wishew makes reciprocity among dreamers the coolest thing ever.\n\nImagine a place where users from around the world share their personal wishes, challenges, and dreams through videos. A place where likes don't exist, but sympathy and appreciation are shown with real dollars. This is the revolution led by Wishew, and given the over 50,000 pre-registrations in less than two weeks, it seems this was exactly what the world was waiting for.\n\nFor World Wish Day, April 29, Wishew debuted as the first social network designed to fulfill wishes is now officially available for download in the U.S. on both Android and Apple app stores. With the app's release, users can immediately post their wishes and start working towards making them come true with the contribution of other dreamers.\n\nWithin Wishew's discover section, users will discover thousands of videos waiting for them, sharing personal stories, challenges, and dreams. It's an immersive, vibrant, and uniquely human experience that engages the user from the first moment. Participation is intuitive and rewarding: through voluntary donations, users contribute to the fulfillment of others' wishes, earning rewards and special privileges in return. At the same time, users can share their own wishes through personal videos, inviting other dreamers to support them.\n\n\"We envisioned Wishew as the greatest wish-granting machine in the world. A platform that reinvents social networking, pushing it towards an era of unprecedented innovation and inclusivity. We are proud to have this extraordinary responsibility.\" - Wishew founders\n\nIn short, Wishew marks the beginning of a new paradigm in social media, bringing a breath of fresh air with a clear goal: to transform wishes into the world's most innovative, cool, and supportive language of connection.\n\n\"In these times, with the direction the world is going, we strongly believe that we can bring more value to people's lives with this platform. A tool like Wishew will allow people to become closer and lend a hand to each other, encouraging camaraderie and positive support. With joy, personal fulfillment and hope for themselves, others, and the future. Perhaps it is a bit bold to say, but for us, this product represents a social revolution. Yes it is ambitious, but we are excited to find out.\" - Wishew founders\n\nCurrently, the global market for desires is worth approximately 100 trillion dollars. This value is based on the money people spend on goods and services and the time and effort they devote to fulfilling their desires. These include going into debt to survive and be happy, individuals feeling alone in society, the constant fear of the pressure to make ends meet, and the mental health epidemic. 90% of Americans believe we are in a mental health crisis. Anxiety and psychological depression are just some of the consequences, layered into the overall scheme of current social, economic and world pressures.\n\nWishew wants to provide people with a new tool to improve their lives. It is designed to make desires attainable, creating excitement through the experience, and taking off personal pressures. People will be able to save more, and be less in debt, by asking for what makes them happier. It is also incentivized to the participants.\n\nBy supporting the wishes of others the users will also earn privileges and points for participating in the Wish Game. Everyday, the most active contributors will have a chance to win amazing prizes such as dream trips, the best in technology, i.e. a new iphone, and more.\n\n\"The idea is to make personal crowdfunding and contribution the most social and cool thing ever.\" - Wishew Founders\n\nPlatforms such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo are solely focused on business proposals and projects. GoFundMe and JustGiving are focused on charitable causes and urgent, serious situations typically that need attention, often as a result of a crisis or death. Wishew is tapping into consumer items, travel, hobbies, as well as dreams, goals, while still encouraging work and projects and charity initiatives to be present on the platform .\n\n\"It would be like Christmas all year round. Everyone has at least one wish, big or small. A platform like this would allow all of us to help each other make our wishes come true.\" - Surveyed user, Mariya Cayton\n\nAfter the United States, the platform will launch in the United Kingdom, Canada, Europe, Mena and Latin America. The goal and initial projection is to reach 10 million users +. The social wish-granting app aims to disrupt the market and revolutionize the social communities offered in the space by offering a new type of platform: allowing users to help each other and themselves to achieve the previously unattainable. The founders offer a fresh approach to the crowdfunding space.\n\nWishew is the latest technological venture by entrepreneurs; Giacomo Vose (Founder & CEO), Antonino Risicato (Co-Founder & CMO), and Vincenzo De Caro (Co-Founder & CGO). Wishew also has closed one of the highest pre-seed funding rounds in the world, 10 million, with the main investor being the public figure Leonardo Maria Del Vecchio through his fund, LMDV Capital.\n\nThe app is now available on the App Store and Google Play.",

        "text": "AP\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Witness testimony in Donald Trump's criminal trial advanced on Tuesday with three people taking the stand, including Keith Davidson, a lawyer who previously represented Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal in hush money negotiations involving the former president.\n\nDavidson's testimony dominated the afternoon, highlighting his interactions with Trump's ex-lawyer Michael Cohen and detailing the lead-up to a deal that ultimately came with a $130,000 payment to Daniels.\n\nTuesday's proceedings, however, kicked off with the judge holding Trump in contempt and fining him $9,000 over nine online posts that he found violated a gag order barring the former president from speaking publicly about jurors and witnesses in the case.\n\nMerchan warned that if Trump does it again, he could be jailed.\n\nWhen court resumes Thursday, another hearing will be held on four more alleged gag order violations.\n\nA New York state appeals court on Tuesday also rejected Trump's request for a stay of the trial while he appeals several pretrial rulings, including the trial judge's refusal to recuse himself.\n\nThe charges in the case center on $130,000 in payments that Trump's company made to Cohen. Prosecutors say Trump obscured the true nature of those payments and falsely recorded them as legal expenses.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.\n\nThe case is the first-ever criminal trial of a former U.S. president and the first of four prosecutions of Trump to reach a jury.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- Key players: Who's who at Donald Trump's hush money criminal trial\n\n-- The hush money case is just one of Trump's legal cases. See the others here\n\n-- Read the judge's full order on Donald Trump's gag order violations\n\n-- Trump and DeSantis meet to make peace and discuss fundraising for the former president's campaign\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nTRUMP HITS OUT AT GAG ORDER AS COURT ADJOURNS FOR THE DAY\n\nDonald Trump complained about the gag order in his hush money trial, as well as other things as he left the courthouse Tuesday following the adjournment of the day's proceedings.\n\nThe former president approached news cameras in the courthouse hallway on his way out and hit on familiar themes, including accusing Judge Juan M. Merchan of bias and of rushing the case, and also saying he should be out campaigning.\n\nTrump was found in contempt of court earlier in the day and fined $9,000 for nine violations of the gag order, which bars him from speaking publicly about witnesses and jurors in the case.\n\nDAVIDSON SAYS HE THOUGHT DANIELS' STORY WOULD 'BE A TORNADO' IF IT GOT OUT\n\nKeith Davidson and Dylan Howard, then-editor of the National Enquirer, texted each other about what Howard called an \"impending storm\" of publicity if Stormy Daniels took her story elsewhere after Michael Cohen failed to make a payment in the deal on time, according to Davidson's testimony and documents shown at the trial on Tuesday.\n\nDavidson wrote to Howard that he believed Daniels and her agent had agreed to bring her story about a sexual encounter with Donald Trump to another publication, and \"I think it'll be a full-on blitz.\"\n\n\"I just felt like there was going to be more than a flurry of activity. I felt like it was going to be a tornado,\" Davidson explained in court.\n\n\"If the story got out,\" Steinglass asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Davidson said.\n\nAsked if Cohen ever told him who he was representing in the Daniels negotiations, Davidson said that he may not have explicitly stated he was working on Trump's behalf -- but the implication was clear.\n\nCOHEN MISSED DEADLINE TO PAY $130K TO STORMY DANIELS, DAVIDSON SAYS\n\nBefore a brief afternoon break in Donald Trump's hush money trial, lawyer Keith Davidson testified Tuesday that Michael Cohen missed an agreed upon deadline for sending a $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels.\n\nAt first, Cohen offered a litany of explanations for the delay, at turns blaming broken computers, Secret Service \"firewalls,\" and the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur. \"The things he was saying didn't really make sense,\" Davidson said of Cohen.\n\nAs the excuses piled up, Davidson said he understood that Cohen \"didn't have the authority to actually spend money.\" He eventually sent an email informing Cohen that the deal involving Daniel's story about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump was off.\n\n\"I thought he was trying to kick the can down the round until after the election,\" Davidson said.\n\nAPPELLATE COURT REJECTS TRUMP'S REQUEST TO STAY HUSH MONEY TRIAL\n\nAs testimony continued in Donald Trump's hush money trial on Tuesday, a five-judge panel in New York state's mid-level appellate court rejected the former president's request for a stay of the proceedings while he appeals several pretrial rulings, including the trial judge's refusal to recuse himself.\n\nTrump had sought the stay prior to the start of jury selection. A lone judge in the appeals court had previously rejected a request for an emergency stay halting the trial.\n\nPSEUDONYMS WERE USED TO DISGUISE PARTIES INVOLVED IN ENQUIRER DEAL, LAWYER TESTIFIES\n\nIn drawing up the deal with the National Enquirer involving Stormy Daniels' story about an alleged sexual encounter with Donald Trump, Keith Davidson testified Tuesday that he used pseudonyms to disguise the parties involved.\n\nStormy Daniels became Peggy Peterson and Donald Trump became David Dennison, according to Davidson.\n\nThe alliterative code names were picked, in part, because Daniels was the plaintiff and Trump was the defendant, the lawyer testified.\n\nAsked by prosecutors in Trump's hush money case if David Dennison was a real person, Davidson said that he played on his high school hockey team.\n\n\"And how does he feel about you now?\" asked prosecutor Josh Steinglass.\n\nDavidson stifled a laugh, then answered: \"He's very upset.\"\n\n'MICHAEL COHEN STEPPED INTO AMI'S SHOES,' DAVIDSON SAYS\n\nStormy Daniels' agent reached a six-figure deal with then-National Enquirer editor Dylan Howard for the tabloid to acquire the rights to her story about a sexual encounter with Donald Trump after his \"Access Hollywood\" tape leaked, Keith Davidson testified Tuesday.\n\nBut then, according to Davidson, Howard backed out.\n\nThe editor instead told Daniels' agent, Gina Rodriguez, to call Michael Cohen and complete the deal directly with him -- but she refused to speak with Cohen after an uncomfortable prior interaction.\n\nRodriguez asked Davidson to step in and negotiate the deal with Cohen, the lawyer testified.\n\nDavidson added that he had numerous interactions with Howard over the years regarding stories. Asked if it was unusual for Howard to direct him to make a deal with a third party like Cohen, Davidson responded: \"This is the only time that ever happened.\"\n\n\"In essence, Michael Cohen stepped into AMI's shoes,\" Davidson said, referring to the name of the Enquirer's parent company at the time, American Media Inc.\n\nDavidson testified that in negotiating with Cohen, he hiked the price to $130,000 -- building in his fee for his work on the deal.\n\n'ACCESS HOLLYWOOD' TAPE LEAK MADE DANIELS' STORY MORE MARKETABLE, LAWYER SAYS\n\nStormy Daniels' story about a sexual encounter with Donald Trump became more marketable after the notorious \"Access Hollywood\" tape was leaked, Keith Davidson testified on Tuesday.\n\nDavidson, who previously represented Daniels, told prosecutors that Daniels' agent, Gina Rodriguez, had been trying to drum up interest in her story earlier in the 2016 election cycle but found there wasn't much.\n\nAsked to describe the \"Access Hollywood\" tape, which can't be shown in court, Davidson testified that it involved Trump and the show's then-host Billy Bush being recorded on a \"hot mic\" and \"some statements by both men that were troublesome.\"\n\n'HE WAS JUST SCREAMING,' LAWYER TESTIFIES OF FIRST INTERACTION WITH COHEN\n\nKeith Davidson on Tuesday testified that his first interaction with Michael Cohen related to a 2011 post on a gossip blog that stated that porn actor Stormy Daniels and Trump had \"some sort of physical or romantic interaction.\"\n\nAfter the blog post was published, Davidson said, Daniels' agent Gina Rodriguez called him and said, \"some jerk called me and was very, very aggressive and threatened to sue me.\"\n\nAsked who the \"jerk\" was, Davidson said: \"Michael Cohen.\"\n\nDavidson testified that when he called Cohen, the ex-Trump lawyer greeted him \"with a hostile barrage of insults and insinuations that went on for quite a while.\"\n\n\"I don't think he was accusing us of anything, he was just screaming,\" Davidson continued. \"Finally, after he finished, I explained to him that I was calling because my client, Stormy Daniels, did not want the story up. I wanted to see if he had done anything\" to try to get the story taken down.\n\nDavidson said he eventually sent a cease-and-desist letter to the blog after the dust up with Cohen and the story was removed.\n\nDAVIDSON SAYS HE UNDERSTOOD THE ENQUIRER WOULD NEVER PUBLISH MCDOUGAL'S STORY\n\nLawyer Keith Davidson testified on Tuesday that back-and-forth haggling took place in the selling of former Playboy model Karen McDougal's story to the National Enquirer.\n\nIn one text message shown to jurors, Davidson told Enquirer editor Dylan Howard that \"they are asking me to go back for another 25,\" meaning another $25,000. Howard responds with an expletive, adding, \"Not my money. I'll ask.\"\n\nBut even as they reached a basic framework for the deal, Davidson described his \"growing frustration with the process.\" At one point, Davidson said he was pushed to call Donald Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen directly, something he said he had been trying to avoid.\n\n\"I thought it was odd, certainly,\" Davidson said about being asked to call Cohen. \"I didn't particularly like dealing with him and that's why I was trying like hell to avoid talking to him,\" he added.\n\nDavidson testified that he understood McDougal's story would never be published and acknowledged that \"there was an unspoken understanding that there was an affiliation between David Pecker and Donald Trump and that AMI wouldn't run this story, any story related to Karen, because it would hurt Donald Trump.\"\n\nTRUMP'S ONLINE POSTS FOUND TO VIOLATE GAG ORDER HAVE BEEN REMOVED\n\nDonald Trump's online posts that on Tuesday were found to violate a gag order barring him from speaking publicly about jurors and witnesses in his criminal hush money trial were removed ahead of an afternoon deadline.\n\nThe posts in question were deleted while the court was in recess for lunch.\n\nLinks to the old Truth Social posts redirected to a \"Not found\" message, while those on Trump's website redirected to a 404 error page.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Judge Juan M. Merchan fined the former president $9,000 for the nine posts for violating the order.\n\nTEXAS AG PAXTON AMONG THOSE IN COURTROOM AS TRUMP'S TRIAL RESUMES\n\nCourt in Donald Trump's criminal trial resumed Tuesday after an early afternoon lunch break.\n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton walked into the courtroom with Trump and his entourage after posting on social media earlier in the day that he was there to support the former president. The Republican sat down in the first row of the courtroom gallery directly behind the defense table.\n\nPaxton sat just a few seats away from Trump's son Eric, who sat near the aisle alongside Susie Wiles, a Trump political operative.\n\nKeith Davidson, a lawyer who previously represented former Playboy model Karen McDougal and porn actor Stormy Daniels in hush money negotiations, was expected to returned to the witness stand.\n\nDAVIDSON SHEDS LIGHT ON SEQUENCE OF EVENTS THAT LED TO THE DEAL WITH THE ENQUIRER\n\nKeith Davidson testified Tuesday that after tipping off a National Enquirer editor about \"a blockbuster Trump story,\" he soon arranged a meeting with that editor, former Playboy model Karen McDougal and others to see whether the Enquirer's then-parent company was interested.\n\nAfter flying back to New York, Howard told him the Enquirer wasn't keen \"because Karen McDougal lacked documentary evidence of the interaction,\" Davidson testified.\n\nMcDougal had alleged that she had a year-long affair with Donald Trump years earlier.\n\nA month later, Enquirer editor Dylan Howard reached out again to Davidson, suggesting they resume discussions.\n\nAt the time, Davidson warned that the Enquirer's parent company would need to move quickly, writing in one text: \"Time is of the essence. The girl is being cornered by the estrogen mafia\"\n\nDavidson testified that McDougal was \"teetering\" at the time he sent the message and on the verge of signing a deal to tell her story to ABC News.\n\nDavidson also testified that he played the National Enquirer and ABC News against each other to get the best deal for his client. McDougal didn't want to tell her story publicly, which would've been required if she went to ABC, he said.\n\nJURY SEES TEXTS FROM LAWYER PROMISING TABLOID EDITOR A 'BLOCKBUSTER TRUMP STORY'\n\nIn his court testimony on Tuesday, attorney Keith Davidson described representing Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model, in her allegations of a year-long affair with Donald Trump.\n\nAs questioning turned toward Davidson's involvement in some of the hush money deals at the heart of the former president's criminal trial, he said he met McDougal 25 years ago through a friend. He said he started representing in 2016 \"to provide advice and counsel as to what her rights and obligations would be regarding a personal interaction that she had.\"\n\n\"With whom?\" prosecutor Joshua Steinglass asked.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"Donald Trump.\"\n\nShortly after Davidson began representing McDougal, he said, he reached out to Dylan Howard, the editor in chief of the National Enquirer, promising a \"blockbuster Trump story.\"\n\nHoward replied soon after: \"I will get you more than ANYONE for it. You know why.\"\n\nAs the text messages were displayed on screens to the jury, Davidson testified that he didn't know exactly what Howard meant at the time. But, he noted, \"I knew that Dylan's boss David Pecker and Mr. Trump were longtime friends and had a former business relationship,\" he said, adding the tabloid had effectively \"endorsed Mr. Trump's candidacy.\"\n\nSTORMY DANIELS' FORMER LAWYER CALLED TO THE STAND\n\nA lawyer who previously represented former Playboy model Karen McDougal and porn actor Stormy Daniels was the next witness called to the stand in Donald Trump's hush money trial.\n\nKeith Davidson took the stand shortly after noon Tuesday and is known for representing people trying to sell celebrity sex tapes or other embarrassing information.\n\nHe represented McDougal and Daniels in hush money negotiations with the National Enquirer and Trump's then-lawyer Michael Cohen in 2016.\n\nMcDougal claimed she had had a yearlong affair with Trump in the mid-2000s. Daniels claimed she had a one-time sexual encounter with him in 2006. Trump has denied both allegations.\n\nEXECUTIVE CALLED TO THE STAND TO VERIFY TRANSCRIPT, VIDEO OF TRUMP DEPOSITION\n\nAn executive at a company that provides stenographers and videographers for depositions -- sworn, out-of-court statements under oath -- was the next witness called to the stand in Donald Trump's criminal trial on Tuesday.\n\nPhillip Thompson was called to authenticate a transcript and video of a deposition the former president gave in one of writer E. Jean Carroll's federal defamation lawsuits against him.\n\nThe portions included Carroll's lawyer asking Trump about his Truth Social platform, the dates of his marriage to wife Melania Trump and whether he was aware of the \"Access Hollywood\" tape.\n\nThe former longtime Elle magazine advice columnist had alleged that Trump sexually assaulted her in the 1990s and then defamed her after she came forward publicly in 2019. He has said nothing happened between the two of them and called her a \"wack job\" who engineered a \"hoax\" to sell a book.\n\nAfter two federal trials last year and this winter, juries awarded Carroll over $88 million. Trump is appealing.\n\nVIDEOS OF TRUMP DENYING ALLEGATIONS AND PRAISING COHEN PLAYED IN COURT\n\nProsecutors in Donald Trump's hush money case played C-SPAN clips on Tuesday of the then-presidential candidate on the campaign trail in the final weeks leading up to the 2016 election. In the videos, Trump forcefully denied allegations made by several women after his infamous 2005 \"Access Hollywood\" tape was made public.\n\n\"The stories are total fiction. They're 100% made up, they never happened, they never would happen,\" Trump said in video from an Oct. 14, 2016 rally in North Carolina.\n\nAnother clip played for the jury, from January 2017, showed Trump praising Michael Cohen as as good lawyer and friend.\n\nTrump did not appear to react in court to the clips, which were played on monitors throughout the courtroom, including directly in front of him on the defense table.\n\nAfter confirming the veracity of the clips, Robert Browning -- the executive director of C-SPAN's archives -- was dismissed from the witness stand. Trump's attorneys declined to question him.\n\nEXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF C-SPAN ARCHIVES CALLED TO THE STAND\n\nThe next witness called to the stand Tuesday in Donald Trump's hush money trial was Robert Browning, the executive director of the C-SPAN archives.\n\nBrowning, who manages the network's video collection, was called to verify the authenticity of video of a Trump campaign event.\n\nProsecutors are calling people who are regarded as \"records custodians\" to verify evidence in the former president's criminal case.\n\nTRIAL WILL BREAK FOR 4 DAYS OVER MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND\n\nDonald Trump's hush money trial will get an extra day off for the Memorial Day weekend next month.\n\nCourt won't be in session on Friday, May 24, to accommodate a juror who has a flight that morning, Judge Juan M. Merchan said on Tuesday.\n\nThat means the trial will be off for four straight days for the holiday weekend, resuming on Tuesday, May 28. Merchan also informed jurors there will not be court on May 17, though he didn't give them a reason.\n\nThat's the day Donald Trump will be attending his son Barron's high school graduation.\n\nPROSECUTORS WANT TO QUESTION TRUMP ABOUT GAG ORDER VIOLATIONS IF HE TESTIFIES\n\nAhead of a midday break in Donald Trump's hush money case, prosecutors asked the judge to let them question the former president about his gag order violations should he choose to testify.\n\nThe request came after Judge Juan M. Merchan ruled Tuesday morning that Trump had on nine occasions violated a court mandate barring him from speaking publicly about witnesses and jurors in the case. He ultimately fined Trump $9,000 and will hold another hearing Thursday on four more alleged gag order violations.\n\nProsecutors also requested permission to introduce evidence they said shows Trump orchestrated a \"pressure campaign and intimidation effort\" against Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels.\n\nColangelo said Trump's attorney opened the door to that evidence by seeking to undermine the credibility of the two witnesses in opening statements.\n\nMerchan did not immediately rule, but said, \"the door has been opened.\"\n\nHe previously ruled to allow prosecutors to challenge Trump's credibility by questioning him about a limited number of his recent legal setbacks if he ends up taking the witness stand.\n\nTrump has said he wants to testify, but is under no obligation to do so.\n\nNO RED FLAGS ABOUT COHEN'S ACCOUNTS AT THE TIME, FARRO SAYS\n\nIn his cross examination of banker Gary Farro on Tuesday, defense attorney Todd Blanche underscored that Michael Cohen made no mention that the accounts he opened in October 2016 had anything to do with deals involving then-presidential candidate Donald Trump or his company.\n\nIf Cohen had done so, \"I would have asked questions,\" Farro said.\n\nFarro noted that he might not have opened a bank account for Cohen if he'd been told it was for what's known as a shell corporation -- one that receives and sends out money but doesn't have an underlying business.\n\nBut Cohen, the banker said, told him the account was for a real estate consulting business.\n\nNothing about it raised \"any red flags to you?\" Blanche asked.\n\n\"Not based upon the answers I was given to the questions I asked,\" Farro said.\n\nFarro's testimony shed light on his role in helping Cohen open a bank account that was later used to process a $130,000 wire transfer to a lawyer for Stormy Daniels.\n\nDEFENSE BEGINS CROSS-EXAMINATION OF FARRO\n\nDefense attorneys began their cross-examination of Gary Farro, the prosecution's third witness in Donald Trump's hush money trial, by asking the banker to describe his relationship with Michael Cohen.\n\nFarro said he first met Cohen -- then serving as the former president's personal lawyer -- in person at a meeting in Trump Tower, but primarily communicated over the phone. Pushed by Todd Blanche, Farro acknowledged that Cohen wasn't always easy to work with.\n\n\"He was a challenging client because of his desire to get things done so quickly,\" Farro said. \"Ninety percent of the time it was an urgent matter.\"\n\nPROSECUTORS WRAP QUESTIONING OF FARRO\n\nProsecutors have wrapped up questioning of Gary Farro, their third witness in Donald Trump's criminal hush money trial.\n\nFarro told prosecutors on Tuesday that Michael Cohen had indicated that a 2016 $130,000 wire payment now at the heart of the case was related to a real estate transaction -- not a political candidate, an adult film performer or buying up a potential media story.\n\n\"We might consider something like that a reputational risk,\" Farro said.\n\nWithin a day of opening the Essential Consultants LLC bank account on Oct. 26, 2016 -- and funding it with about $130,000 from his own home equity loan -- Cohen wired out $130,000 to Keith Davidson, then a lawyer for Stormy Daniels, documents showed.\n\nThe 2016 presidential election was on Nov. 8.\n\nFAMILY JOINS TRUMP IN COURT FOR THE FIRST TIME\n\nDonald Trump's son Eric joined his father in court on Tuesday, marking the first time any of the former president's family members have attended his criminal hush money trial.\n\nPrior to court proceedings resuming, Trump turned from the defense table and walked over to his son in the first row of the gallery. Trump put his hand on Eric's arm as they chatted.\n\nTrump had railed about the trial, as well as his other legal cases, to reporters on his way into the courtroom earlier in the morning.\n\nFARRO RETURNS TO THE STAND\n\nTestimony in Donald Trump's hush money trial resumed with Gary Farro, a banker who helped Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen open accounts. Cohen used one such account to buy the silence of porn performer Stormy Daniels in the weeks before the 2016 election. She alleged a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump, which he denies.\n\nCohen indicated the account, opened in late October 2016 in the name of Essential Consultants LLC, would be used for real estate consulting, according to testimony and documents shown at the trial.\n\nIn response to prosecutor Becky Mangold's questions, Farro said the bank would have asked more questions if there had been any mention of a connection to a political candidate, buying a story that was being pitched to the media or paying a porn performer.\n\nThe additional scrutiny would have delayed or even nixed opening the account, which Cohen had wanted to open right away. In particular, the adult film world \"is an industry we don't work with,\" he said.\n\nWith only real estate in the picture, the account was opened within a day -- \"very quick,\" Farro said.\n\nMERCHAN FINDS POST ABOUT COHEN AND DANIELS WAS NOT A VIOLATION\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan found that one of Donald Trump's online posts about his former lawyer Michael Cohen and porn actor Stormy Daniels did not violate a gag order barring him from speaking publicly about jurors and witnesses in his hush money case.\n\nMerchan wrote that he was finding Trump \"in criminal contempt for willfully disobeying a lawful mandate\" of the court on nine separate occasions for posts made on Truth Social and his campaign website.\n\nMerchan ruled that Trump's April 10 post referring to Cohen and Daniels as \"sleaze bags\" was not a gag order violation. He said Trump's contention that he was responding to previous posts by Cohen \"is sufficient to give\" him pause \"as to whether the People have met their burden\" as to that post.\n\nHowever, the other nine \"attack the credibility of arguably two of the more high-profile witnesses in this case.\"\n\n\"To allow such attacks upon protected witnesses with blanket assertions that they are all responses to 'political attacks' would be an exception that swallowed the rule. The Expanded Order does not contain such an exception,\" Merchan wrote.\n\nJUDGE FINDS TRUMP VIOLATED GAG ORDER, FINES HIM $9K\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan ruled Tuesday morning that Donald Trump violated a gag order barring him from making public statements about witnesses and jurors in his hush money trial nine times. He fined the former president $9,000 for the violations.\n\nProsecutors had alleged the former president had violated the order 10 times, and Merchan concurred in all but one of those instances. The judge will hold a hearing Thursday on four more alleged violations.\n\nThe former president stared down at the table in front of him as Merchan read the ruling, frowning slightly but otherwise showing no expression.\n\nMerchan wrote in his ruling that Trump \"is hereby warned that the Court will not tolerate continued willful violations of its lawful orders\" and raised the possibility of jail time if \"necessary and appropriate under the circumstances.\"\n\nJUDGE TO ALLOW TRUMP TO ATTEND SON'S GRADUATION\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan said Tuesday morning that Donald Trump's criminal hush money trial will not be held on May 17 so that the former president can attend his son's graduation.\n\n\"I don't think the May 17 date is a problem, so Mr. Trump can certainly attend that date, attend his son's graduation,\" Merchan said.\n\nTrump had previously requested the day off from court to accommodate his son Barron's high school graduation.\n\nTRUMP ARRIVES AT COURT\n\nDonald Trump's motorcade arrived Tuesday morning at the courthouse in lower Manhattan just before 9 a.m., kicking off the second week of witness testimony in the former president's hush money trial.\n\nA crowd of around 60 Trump supporters had gathered across the street from the building, waving Trump and American flags on tall poles.\n\nTRUMP LEAVES TRUMP TOWER FOR COURT\n\nDonald Trump entered his motorcade outside Trump Tower in midtown, headed to the courthouse in lower Manhattan for the second week of trial testimony.\n\nThe former president on Tuesday will be in court for testimony from the third prosecution witness, Gary Farro, a banker who helped Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen open accounts.\n\nCohen used one to buy the silence of porn performer Stormy Daniels. She alleged a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump, which he denies.",

        "text": "As work on the Mountain Valley Pipeline nears a finish, the price of the massive infrastructure project continues to climb.\n\nThe estimated cost is now $7.85 billion, according to a first-quarter earnings report released Tuesday by Equitrans Midstream Corp., the lead partner of the 303-mile natural gas pipeline.\n\nThat's up from $7.6 billion earlier this year, and more than double the $3.7 billion projection made in 2018, when construction began on the deeply controversial project that cuts a path through the New River and Roanoke valleys.\n\nWith work delayed by litigation over the environmental impacts of running a buried pipe through mountains and streams, opponents had hoped that rising costs would be the death of Mountain Valley.\n\nBut in its report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Equitrans outlined hopes to place the pipeline in operation by June 1, which would allow it to finally begin collecting revenue from the gas it will transport to East Coast markets.\n\n\"We are pleased to be so close to completing this critical infrastructure project,\" Diana Charletta, Equitrans' president and CEO, said in the report.\n\nBefore gas can begin flowing through the pipeline, Mountain Valley must receive final permission from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which first approved the project in 2017.\n\nIn a letter to FERC on Tuesday, the Sierra Club and 17 other organizations that have long fought the pipeline asked the commission to deny Mountain Valley's request.\n\nA key concern raised in the letter - and in more than 50 written comments from individuals filed with FERC since the request was made April 22 - is that Mountain Valley has not fully completed inspections and repairs to ensure the 42-inch diameter pipe is structurally sound.\n\nWhile construction was delayed for years, sections of pipe lay dormant along Mountain Valley's right-of-way and in storage yards, raising fears that a protective coating - meant to guard against corrosion once the pipe is buried - had been weakened by exposure to sunlight and bad weather.\n\nIn October, the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration issued a consent order addressing what it called \"an integrity risk to public safety, property or the environment.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nMountain Valley was directed to follow an extensive process of inspecting the pipes and making repairs when necessary, under the watch of an independent firm that would report back to PHMSA.\n\nThat process has yet to be completed, the Sierra Club and other organizations wrote in their letter to FERC Tuesday. \"The Commission should deny Mountain Valley's premature request to place the facilities in service,\" the letter states.\n\nWhen Mountain Valley made its request April 22, it told FERC that it had completed all aspects of the consent order that dealt with the pipe's coating. The company's deputy general counsel wrote that it would keep the agency informed of when it has satisfied the remaining requirements, which deal mostly with the Virginia portion of the pipeline. The pipeline starts in northern West Virginia and traverses across the state for about 200 miles before entering Virginia in Giles County.\n\nIn addition to raising concerns about the pipe coating, opponents said that construction has not been fully completed, and that problems persist with muddy runoff from work sites.\n\nMountain Valley said in its first quarter earnings statement Tuesday that less than one mile of the pipeline's 303-mile length remains to be installed. All crossings of water bodies and wetlands have been completed.\n\nUnfinished \"forward construction\" includes the tying together of some final pipeline segments and \"the installation of pipe on a steep slope,\" the report states.\n\nMountain Valley spokeswoman Natalie Cox declined to give the location of the steep slope, citing the company's \"heightened safety and security protocols.\" Some pipeline opponents have temporarily blocked construction by chaining themselves to construction equipment over the years, and Mountain Valley has sought injunctions to stop what it calls illegal and dangerous behavior.\n\nAccording to Roberta Bondurant of Preserve Bent Mountain, work continued this week at a site on nearby Poor Mountain, where construction crews are boring a tunnel for the pipe along an especially steep slope.\n\nAfter years of opposition and lawsuits, work on the pipeline was fast-tracked last year by Congress. A federal law declared the project in the national interest and forbade the type of lawsuits filed by environmental groups that had tied construction up for years.\n\nBut the law does not apply to Southgate, a planned 75-mile extension of the pipeline that would run from its current terminus in Pittsylvania County into North Carolina.\n\nLast week, opponents filed a lawsuit that challenges FERC's decision to give Mountain Valley more time to complete the extension.\n\n\"Approving the Southgate project is irresponsible,\" said David Sligh of Wild Virginia, one of the groups that filed suit. \"This project will pose the same kinds of threats of damage to the environment and the people along its path as we have seen caused by the Mountain Valley Pipeline during the last six years.\"\n\nShawn Day, a spokesman for Southgate, said opponents \"continue to use misinformation and delay tactics to try and deny families and businesses from access to reliable, affordable, and cleaner energy.\"\n\nDemand for natural gas is strong in North Carolina, where the pipeline extension is fully subscribed to carry gas for two energy companies, Day wrote in an email. Completion of Southgate is targeted for 2028.\n\nLaurence Hammack (540) 981-3239\n\nlaurence.hammack@roanoke.com\n\nTags The Economy Law Trade Politics Business Ecology Finance Construction Industry Transportation Industry Roads And Traffic Hydrography Sports Get local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSubscribe to our Daily Headlines newsletter.\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.

In the fourth iOS 17.5 beta, 9to5Mac and MacRumors found that Apple is planning to introduce a new \"Repair State\" mode that keeps the anti-theft measures on while your iPhone is getting fixed.\n\nApple and many authorized repair providers currently ask you to turn off Find My when you're getting your iPhone repaired. It has this requirement to \"prevent anyone else from getting service for your device without your knowledge,\" according to Apple's support page.\n\nBut turning off Find My got a little more tricky with the introduction of Stolen Device Protection. When enabled, this feature forces you to wait one hour before performing certain actions, like turning off Find My. That isn't too convenient if you forget to turn off Find My before you arrive at the Apple Store for a repair.\n\nThe new Repair State option should change this. As pointed out by 9to5Mac, it will let you confirm that your phone is getting repaired by entering your Apple ID and password. You can then continue to track your phone from other devices. The device will have a \"Ready for Repair\" in the Find My app when the option is enabled, along with a note that the \"device remains fully functional,\" 9to5Mac reports.",

(AP) -- Pennsylvania took a step Tuesday toward becoming the latest state to punish someone for using a Bluetooth-connected device to track someone without their permission.\n\nThe state House of Representatives voted 199-1 to approve legislation that would make using a tracking device to secretly track another person part of Pennsylvania's laws against stalking. The crime would be punishable as a third-degree misdemeanor, or up to 90 days in jail.\n\nThe bill goes to the Senate, where a separate bill is pending that would make the crime a second-degree misdemeanor, or punishable by up to two years in jail.\n\nMost states have a provision in state law that prohibits remote tracking, while others are adding it. Ohio is considering such legislation, Florida is increasing penalties for using such a device and Kentucky approved a new law last year.\n\nBluetooth-controlled devices made by various tech giants or digital apps installed on a mobile phone can secretly track the movements of another person.\n\nThe House bill's passage Tuesday comes a few weeks after a federal judge denied Apple's motion to dismiss a class-action lawsuit contending that the tech giant hasn't done enough to prevent stalkers from using its AirTag devices to track victims.\n\nApple's $29 AirTags have become popular items since their 2021 release, helping users keep tabs on the location of anything from lost keys to wallets and luggage.\n\nBut stalkers have also taken advantage of AirTags and similar tracking devices, and dozens of plaintiffs sued Apple in 2022, contending that AirTag users had stalked them. They said its safety features are inadequate and that Apple should have done more to protect victims after AirTags \"revolutionized the scope, breadth, and ease of location-based stalking.\"\n\nApple has condemned any malicious use of the product. It argued in court that it \"took proactive steps\" to deter misuse and that it shouldn't be liable for damage caused by third parties.\n\nLast year, Apple partnered with Google to set standards for fighting secret surveillance with tracking devices.",

The Cathedral, officially known as the Cathedral Church of Saint Peter and Saint Paul, sits atop Mount Saint Alban, the highest point in Washington, D.C. In this episode, Stewart McLaurin, president of the Association, is joined by The Very Reverend Randolph Marshall Hollerith, the 11th Dean of Washington National Cathedral, and The Reverend Canon Jan Naylor Cope, D. Min., the Provost of Washington National Cathedral, to discuss the role the Cathedral has played in America's history and the indelible link it has to those who hold the office of the President of the United States.\n\nThe Cathedral is not only the home to an Episcopal congregation but a house of prayer for all people from around the United States and the world. Construction began in 1907 and the Cathedral took shape during two World Wars, the Great Depression and 16 presidencies. It is known today as a sacred place for national prayer services and more.\n\nOver the course of the Cathedral's history, in addition to Sunday services, presidents and key figures in politics have taken to the pulpit during poignant moments in time. The White House and the city of Washington, and even the Cathedral, were important scenes of the Civil Rights Movement. In late 1968, Dean Francis Sayre Jr. invited Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to preach at the Cathedral.\n\nIn addition to presidential families and activities, the Cathedral is an integral part of many families' lives in Washington, D.C. from Easter to Christmas services, and every sermon in between.\n\nThe full video of this podcast episode is also available on the White House Historical Association's YouTube channel here.\n\nThe White House 1600 Sessions podcast is available on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.\n\nThe White House 1600 Sessions\n\nThe White House Historical Association's President Stewart McLaurin is the host of The White House 1600 Sessions, the Association's official audio and video podcast devoted to exploring the history, cultural impact, untold stories, and personal accounts of America's most iconic residence and highest office.\n\nAbout the White House Historical Association\n\nThe White House Historical Association was founded in 1961 by First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy to support her vision to restore and preserve the Executive Mansion and its legacy for generations to come. Mrs. Kennedy sought to inspire Americans, especially children, to explore and engage with American history and its presidents. Supported entirely by private resources, the Association is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that has contributed more than $115 million to the White House in fulfillment of its mission.

        "text": "The Beats Solo 4 arrive in 100% fiber-based packaging and use \"50% or more recycled plastic in multiple components.\" It's the direction much of the industry has been (thankfully) heading to reduce environmental impacts of their products.\n\nThe headphones look almost identical to the Beats Solo3 and come in three colors; Slate Blue, Matte Black, and Cloud Pink (the color of our sample). In comparison to the Tidal Blue and Stone Purple (which, if we're honest, was a pink) colors of the Beats Fit Pro, the blue and pink of the Beats Solo 4 headphones are far more subdued. Promotional materials show Could Pink as a more vibrant pink than our sample, which tended more towards an off white in most lighting. This isn't a complaint, as I really liked the Cloud Pink color in person -- more so than from the pictures provided by Beats.\n\nWhen you're spending a couple hundred dollars on headphones, they better have good sound quality and the Beats Solo 4 deliver. They have an overall well-balanced sound profile with slightly pushed mid frequencies that increases the presence of vocals and a bit of high end sizzle, but it's not fatiguing.\n\nPassive listening is possible with either the included 3.5mm audio cable or USB-C. The sound is remarkably similar to what is heard over Bluetooth, although at an overall lower loudness. Using the included USB-C cable also allows for lossless listening through Apple Music. With an iPhone 15 Max as a source, listening to \"Head Down\" from Soundgarden's seminal Superunknown over USB-C took a bit of the high-end edge off of the sound, so Matt Cameron's continual cymbal crashes in the chorus sat nicely in the mix as intended instead of pulling focus from Chris Cornell's vocals. It's a minor difference, but a good one if you don't want the slightly bright response the Beats Solo 4 produce over Bluetooth and don't mind wired audio.\n\nConnecting to an Apple device over USB-C, in combination with the Beats personalized spatial audio feature, allows for Dolby Atmos listening. Depending on the mix, this can lead to a more spacious soundfield presentation\n\nOne caveat is for the bass lovers out there. The Beats Solo 4 continue the company's move away from the heavy bass-forward headphones of yesteryear. In fact, I'd say they left me a bit wanting for some more bass response at times. But, as mentioned below, there's no ability to modify the EQ, so apart from the minor alterations you can get between Bluetooth vs wired, what you hear is what you get.\n\nThe Beats Solo3 already included excellent battery life -- listed at 40 hours -- but the Solo 4 improve on that by an additional 25% for up to 50 hours total. After topping off the battery once I took the headphones out of their case, I never needed to recharge them during the week I spent evaluating them.\n\nNot only that, they didn't remotely approach the need for a recharge. Even with lengthy listening sessions, the Beats Solo 4 should last a week before being plugged in. If you do find yourself almost out of power, a quick 10-minute charge (what Beats calls \"fast fuel\") will get you another five hours of listening.\n\nOne of the benefits of keeping with the design of the Beats Solo3 for the Solo 4, is their compact foldability. A metallic hinge on either side of the headband allows the ear cups to fold in and fit in the cloth zippered carrying case. The bag, while malleable, has a structure to it that protects the headphones when tossed into a bag. Inside the bag a two side pouches to hold the included USB-C and 3.5mm cables.\n\nWhile there are plenty of headphones out there that are compatible with both iOS and Android, Beats has the benefit of being a part of the Apple family, so iOS compatibility is as seamless as it is with the Apple AirPods Pro 2.\n\nIt also includes native Apple features like Apple Sharing (which allows for music to be shared with compatible Beats headphones or AirPods), easy one-touch pairing setup, iCloud/iPhone/Watch pairing with connected devices, Hey Siri, and Find My.\n\nAndroid users get many of those features as well -- including one-touch pairing, Find My Device, and audio switching -- but require the Beats App to be installed (there's no extra app necessary for features on Apple devices).\n\nBack when the Beats Solo3 were released in 2016, features like active noise cancellation and equalization were luxurious additions to pricey headphones. But a lot has changed in the past eight years, and now both can be found on a multitude of headphones under $100 -- and with excellent performance. It makes the fact that both are absent on the Beats Solo 4 glaring omissions.\n\nThere are seemingly obvious reasons why Beats chose not to include both. ANC is a significant drain on the battery when active, requires more processing (and more mics required to do well), and increases the cost to manufacture because of the extra components needed.\n\nAs for EQ, one of the design philosophies behind the Beats Solo 4 is that they are passively tuned -- that is, without relying on digital signal processing (DSP) -- so you're hearing the natural frequency curve of the drivers and enclosures. This means, as mentioned above, that you're getting a similar sound profile regardless of the transmission method (Bluetooth vs USB-C vs 3.5mm) assuming the source is the same.\n\nThankfully, the sound profile of the Beats Solo 4 is pleasant to listen to, but if you're a fan of heavy bass, there's no DSP available to boost those frequencies.\n\nThe one feature we're really missing, though, is a transparency mode. While there isn't ANC, the passive noise cancellation delivers good enough isolation that the ability to mix in ambient sound for more situational awareness would be beneficial.\n\nIt should be said that the Beats Solo 4 don't have nearly the amount of clamping force the Beats3 had, and still feel very secure comfortable thanks to their cushioned ear cups. In my time testing, there was never a concern that they would shift position or fall off of my head. On the flip side, their clamping force is still a bit strong and should be considered if you're sensitive to that. I can be susceptible to headaches, and after an hour or two could start to feel the fatigue on my ears.\n\nAnother issue is due to one of the drawbacks of on-ear headphones. Instead of the ear cup surrounding your entire ear as it does with over-ear headphones, the Beats Solo 4 ear cups press against the ear helix, which is in turn pressed against your head. If your glasses have thin temples (the part that rests on your ear) as my sunglasses do, that pressure can get uncomfortable real fast. I didn't encounter this same issue with my reading glasses that have much thicker and more durable temples, so this is very much a specific use case situation.\n\nFor the most part, call quality on both sides of the call was great. I sounded clear and suitably present for those I was talking to and passing traffic only caused a bit of interference, but nothing more than is comparable to other headphones. The issue was only heard on my end.\n\nWhen the wind would pick up to a moderate level, it came through the headphones as mild distortion. The noise didn't disrupt my ability to hear and understand who I was talking to (and they didn't hear any distortion on their end), but with large enough gusts I could see it becoming an annoyance.\n\nBeats didn't try to reinvent headphones with the Solo 4. On the contrary, they took an already successful pair and moved them into 2024. Sound is improved and they're more comfortable than the old Solo3 while keeping the distinctive Beats style (which is sure to be a huge selling point for many). In a world of on-ear headphones mostly full of inexpensive options that don't have the sound or design pedigree, they stand out as an excellent option.\n\nTheir distinct drawback is the missing features we've come to expect from modern headphones. For many, no ANC will be a glaring omission. The Sony Ult Wear fill that need for the same price, with a bassier sound profile (that admittedly verges on too much) and EQ capabilities. Then there are the Anker Space One for half the price, although their audio quality isn't quite as good. But most importantly, both of these are over-ear options because the market is devoid of quality on-ear headphones we'd be confident in recommending.\n\nThat is, beyond these. Because of the missing features that are regularly found in headphones in their price range, they aren't the perfect choice for everyone, but as mentioned, the pickings are slim for quality on-ear headphones with great sound. If you're looking for on-ear headphones, the Beats Solo 4 are the pair to get.",

Boy writes pithy press release. Welcome, friends, to the current state of the relationship between Fubo and Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nFubo -- the smallest of the major live streaming services in the U.S. -- today announced that it has failed to renew a content agreement with Warner Bros. Discovery, which has led to the loss of a number of channels. That includes Discovery itself, along with HGTV, Food Network, and TLC. It also extends to TNT, TBS, and truTV.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nAs is usually the case in what in the industry are called carriage agreements -- wherein a service has the rights to carry channels -- it's a whole lot of he said/she said. Fubo says it \"offered Warner Brothers Discovery market rates for its content and, despite Fubo's efforts to negotiate in good faith, Warner Brothers Discovery did not provide any counteroffer, and insisted on continuing to offer us above-market rates for its content.\"\n\nRelated Former Apple exec joins upcoming sports streaming service as CEO The [redacted] bits are the best part of Fubo's sports streamer lawsuit New sports streaming service aimed at 60 million 'cord-nevers'\n\nWhat we don't know is what a fair-market rate is, or what Fubo's offer was. That sort of thing is usually kept private between the parties. Fubo also said that \"Fubo views Warner Brothers Discovery's refusal to engage in good faith negotiations as another example of its abuse of massive market power that ultimately limits consumer choice.\"\n\nThat \"abuse of massive market power\" refers to a lawsuit that Fubo has filed against WBD, Fox, and Disney over a new sports streaming service (also called a joint venture -- the term used when competing companies work together on something) that's set to launch this fall in time for the college football season. That service, which is still unnamed, combines the substantial sports rights of those three companies under a single umbrella. Executives have repeatedly said the service is aimed at consumers who don't currently have any sort of streaming or cable service but still want to be able to watch sports. Fubo says it's going to kill its business, which already has higher monthly user fees than its competition, and nowhere near the marketing budget.\n\n\"It is clear to us that Warner Bros. Discovery's actions hurt consumer wallets and limit their choice,\" Fubo wrote in the press release. \"As a result, Warner Bros. Discovery networks have left Fubo as of April 30, 2024 at 5pm ET.\"\n\nFubo will announce its first-quarter 2024 earnings and presumably updated subscriber numbers on May 3. It finished 2023 with 1.618 million paid subscribers, about 25% fewer than Sling TV, and a full 3 million fewer than Hulu With Live TV. The market leader remains YouTube TV, which last announced having more than 8 million paid subscribers.\n\nEditors' Recommendations Max will be available to stream in Europe starting May 21 New streaming service looks to end endless Googling for sports A new streaming sports paradigm doesn't change what's most important Fubo: channels, price, plans, packages, and add-ons Max is now available to watch on YouTube Primetime Channels",

During his trip to the island country, Nadella met Indonesian President Joko Widodo and his cabinet to discuss AI. In a blog post, Microsoft said it plans to \"transform the nation into a global economic powerhouse.\"\n\n\"This new generation of AI is reshaping how people live and work everywhere, including in Indonesia,\" Nadella said. \"The investments we are announcing today - spanning digital infrastructure, skilling, and support for developers - will help Indonesia thrive in this new era.\"\n\nTo support this infrastructure, Microsoft will train 840,000 Indonesians in AI, a big chunk of the 2.5 million AI trainees envisioned across Southeast Asia. It seems plans for the datacenters aren't set in stone yet, but according to Reuters, President Widodo said the small island of Bali just east of Java and the soon-to-be new capital city of Nusantara on the island of Borneo would both be good options.\n\nIndonesia might be appealing to Microsoft for a few reasons. While it is a developing country, it has an emerging tech industry with a 3.1 million member GitHub community, the third largest in the Asia-Pacific region behind India and China. Microsoft predicts the country will be in the top five developer communities in the world by 2026 thanks to its fast growth.\n\nIndonesia also has a sizable population of over 270 million, meaning there's plenty of labor for Microsoft to tap into. That's well behind India and China, but Indonesia is the fourth most populous country in the world, right behind the US at 335 million.\n\nBut perhaps most importantly, Indonesia isn't China, a country not on the best terms with the US, where Microsoft is based. Given the mutual sanctions each country has slapped on the other, investing significantly into China, a more obvious candidate than Indonesia, isn't the best idea right now.\n\nThe $1.7 billion investment in Indonesia just barely surpasses the $1.5 billion Microsoft set aside for United Arab Emirates-based G42 just a couple of weeks ago. The deal apparently involved the AI company switching away from Chinese hardware to use US tech; a similar rule may be enforced in Indonesia.\n\nThe island country is only the first stop on Nadella's tour of Southeast Asia. He also plans on visiting Thailand tomorrow and Malaysia on Thursday. Just like in Indonesia, he will meet with each country's respective leaders, and we possible that Microsoft will announce new investments in the two countries since the CEO likely isn't out there on vacation. ®",

Coordination and communication with other agencies is important because we're all flying in and have multiple aircrafts in the sky. So we need to keep our airspace safe and know who is in it to ensure that anything conflicting with our own public safety aircraft is coordinated without compromise.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

A smaller drone provided a live feed of the incident to the command center, while a larger drone known as the \"workhorse\" was installed with software capable of detecting humans and producing maps, 3D images and thermal images, Evans said.\n\n\"The technology has been evolving since we got started, and now each piece of equipment has its own function,\" he said. \"Now, we're able to deploy two drones at once. We also have the capability to send the live video and images all the way up to Trenton from the command center in case the incident is going to last a long time or if we need additional resources. We didn't have that luxury at first.\"\n\nWhen an emergency scene begins to unfold, first responders choose a location to establish an incident command center and determine whether additional agencies are needed, said American Aerospace Technologies CEO David Yoel.\n\nFrom there, the drones go up in the air and give the command post a detailed view of what the scene looks like in real time within minutes. The drones also provide a recommended evacuation map that law enforcement officials can relay to the general public, Evans said.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nFAA reauthorization guarantees tech center stays in South Jersey\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization Act of 2024, set to be voted on by the House next week, includes guaranteeing that the FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center will remain in South Jersey, said U.S. Rep. Jeff Van Drew, R-2nd.\n\nLow battery life, weather and civilian drones near the incident scene are some of the biggest challenges emergency management officials face when using the equipment, Evans said.\n\n\"The battery life is only so long,\" Evans said. \"We only get about 30 to 40 minutes out of the drones. The weather is also a big factor and could drown the battery life quicker if it's a windy day. Then we have recreational drones we have to be concerned about, and that's why drone detection equipment is brought in.\"\n\nLinda Ziemba, CEO of AeroDefense, the company that makes the drone detection equipment, said the technology, known as the \"Air Warden,\" pre-authorizes emergency management drones so security teams can follow any recreational drones and get them out of the area.\n\n\"The air boss, who is in charge of the incident response, would get a text message and an alert that an unauthorized drone was detected,\" Ziemba said. \"Then it will show them where that pilot is so they can go there and encourage them to not fly in that area.\"\n\nThe event was the third emergency management exercise conducted in collaboration with the National Aerospace Research and Technology Park and the Atlantic County Economic Alliance.\n\nLast year, the two groups teamed up with the Atlantic City Fire Department, Beach Patrol and Police Department to conduct a drone exercise focused on locating a distressed swimmer on the beach.\n\nHoward Kyle, president of the NARTP, said the law enforcement community has been supportive since the organization started doing the exercises and is looking to do more in the future.\n\n\"It has been encouraging to see,\" Kyle said. \"One of the goals of this organization is to establish a center to advance aviation technology and research. These events have an impact that goes right back to those who are serving the community. Law enforcement officials actually come back and share with us what kind of exercises they recommend we do, so hopefully down the road we'll be doing an entirely different scenario.\"\n\nContact John O'Connor:\n\n609-272-7261\n\njoconnor@pressofac.com\n\nTwitter @acpressoconnor\n\nTags Armed Forces Air Travel Aviation Watercraft And Nautical Navigation Security And Public Safety Business Police Ecology Technology Meteorology Sports The Economy Telecommunications Television Software Law Industry Get local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSubscribe to our Daily Headlines newsletter.\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.

So, when something as central as an alarm clock fails to work properly, people notice. That's what's going on with the iPhone, right now.\n\nAs noted by Joe Rossignol at MacRumors, there is a software bug on the iPhone which is affecting the alarms in the Clock app. Some users are finding the alarm clock isn't working and that they are, as a result waking up late.\n\nThere have been issues in the past, often related to the clocks going back or a new year, for instance, but the latest issues have been reported on social media which aren't to do with any of those.\n\nAn alarm clock is pretty straightforward: you choose a time for it to wake you and you trust that it will. But some users, as reported by the Today Show on NBC, have been complaining that the iPhone hasn't been playing the wake-up sound it was instructed to, leaving them to oversleep.\n\nThat's very annoying, and the news has affected Joanna Stern from the Wall Street Journal in the sense that the Today Show called her. She confirmed, however, that her iPhone is performing properly and at the right time, saying in a post on X, \"Today Show called me last night and said iPhone alarms aren't working! I hadn't heard that but Apple confirmed this AM that it is aware of an issue causing some alarms not play a sound and that it's working on a fix. My iPhone alarm woke me up right on time at 6:50AM! Anyone out there having this issue?\"\n\nSo, the good news is that Apple has confirmed that it's working on a fix for the issue.\n\nThe bad news is we don't know enough about the issue to be sure how widespread it is or how it manifests itself. We know it's not affecting everyone and that it's only failing to play certain sounds, rather than all of them.\n\nWhich leaves nobody feeling secure. More on the update as we have it.",

        "text": "AP\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Witness testimony in Donald Trump's criminal trial advanced on Tuesday with three people taking the stand, including Keith Davidson, a lawyer who previously represented Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal in hush money negotiations involving the former president.\n\nDavidson's testimony dominated the afternoon, highlighting his interactions with Trump's ex-lawyer Michael Cohen and detailing the lead-up to a deal that ultimately came with a $130,000 payment to Daniels.\n\nTuesday's proceedings, however, kicked off with the judge holding Trump in contempt and fining him $9,000 over nine online posts that he found violated a gag order barring the former president from speaking publicly about jurors and witnesses in the case.\n\nMerchan warned that if Trump does it again, he could be jailed.\n\nWhen court resumes Thursday, another hearing will be held on four more alleged gag order violations.\n\nA New York state appeals court on Tuesday also rejected Trump's request for a stay of the trial while he appeals several pretrial rulings, including the trial judge's refusal to recuse himself.\n\nThe charges in the case center on $130,000 in payments that Trump's company made to Cohen. Prosecutors say Trump obscured the true nature of those payments and falsely recorded them as legal expenses.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.\n\nThe case is the first-ever criminal trial of a former U.S. president and the first of four prosecutions of Trump to reach a jury.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- Key players: Who's who at Donald Trump's hush money criminal trial\n\n-- The hush money case is just one of Trump's legal cases. See the others here\n\n-- Read the judge's full order on Donald Trump's gag order violations\n\n-- Trump and DeSantis meet to make peace and discuss fundraising for the former president's campaign\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nTRUMP HITS OUT AT GAG ORDER AS COURT ADJOURNS FOR THE DAY\n\nDonald Trump complained about the gag order in his hush money trial, as well as other things as he left the courthouse Tuesday following the adjournment of the day's proceedings.\n\nThe former president approached news cameras in the courthouse hallway on his way out and hit on familiar themes, including accusing Judge Juan M. Merchan of bias and of rushing the case, and also saying he should be out campaigning.\n\nTrump was found in contempt of court earlier in the day and fined $9,000 for nine violations of the gag order, which bars him from speaking publicly about witnesses and jurors in the case.\n\nDAVIDSON SAYS HE THOUGHT DANIELS' STORY WOULD 'BE A TORNADO' IF IT GOT OUT\n\nKeith Davidson and Dylan Howard, then-editor of the National Enquirer, texted each other about what Howard called an \"impending storm\" of publicity if Stormy Daniels took her story elsewhere after Michael Cohen failed to make a payment in the deal on time, according to Davidson's testimony and documents shown at the trial on Tuesday.\n\nDavidson wrote to Howard that he believed Daniels and her agent had agreed to bring her story about a sexual encounter with Donald Trump to another publication, and \"I think it'll be a full-on blitz.\"\n\n\"I just felt like there was going to be more than a flurry of activity. I felt like it was going to be a tornado,\" Davidson explained in court.\n\n\"If the story got out,\" Steinglass asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Davidson said.\n\nAsked if Cohen ever told him who he was representing in the Daniels negotiations, Davidson said that he may not have explicitly stated he was working on Trump's behalf -- but the implication was clear.\n\nCOHEN MISSED DEADLINE TO PAY $130K TO STORMY DANIELS, DAVIDSON SAYS\n\nBefore a brief afternoon break in Donald Trump's hush money trial, lawyer Keith Davidson testified Tuesday that Michael Cohen missed an agreed upon deadline for sending a $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels.\n\nAt first, Cohen offered a litany of explanations for the delay, at turns blaming broken computers, Secret Service \"firewalls,\" and the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur. \"The things he was saying didn't really make sense,\" Davidson said of Cohen.\n\nAs the excuses piled up, Davidson said he understood that Cohen \"didn't have the authority to actually spend money.\" He eventually sent an email informing Cohen that the deal involving Daniel's story about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump was off.\n\n\"I thought he was trying to kick the can down the round until after the election,\" Davidson said.\n\nAPPELLATE COURT REJECTS TRUMP'S REQUEST TO STAY HUSH MONEY TRIAL\n\nAs testimony continued in Donald Trump's hush money trial on Tuesday, a five-judge panel in New York state's mid-level appellate court rejected the former president's request for a stay of the proceedings while he appeals several pretrial rulings, including the trial judge's refusal to recuse himself.\n\nTrump had sought the stay prior to the start of jury selection. A lone judge in the appeals court had previously rejected a request for an emergency stay halting the trial.\n\nPSEUDONYMS WERE USED TO DISGUISE PARTIES INVOLVED IN ENQUIRER DEAL, LAWYER TESTIFIES\n\nIn drawing up the deal with the National Enquirer involving Stormy Daniels' story about an alleged sexual encounter with Donald Trump, Keith Davidson testified Tuesday that he used pseudonyms to disguise the parties involved.\n\nStormy Daniels became Peggy Peterson and Donald Trump became David Dennison, according to Davidson.\n\nThe alliterative code names were picked, in part, because Daniels was the plaintiff and Trump was the defendant, the lawyer testified.\n\nAsked by prosecutors in Trump's hush money case if David Dennison was a real person, Davidson said that he played on his high school hockey team.\n\n\"And how does he feel about you now?\" asked prosecutor Josh Steinglass.\n\nDavidson stifled a laugh, then answered: \"He's very upset.\"\n\n'MICHAEL COHEN STEPPED INTO AMI'S SHOES,' DAVIDSON SAYS\n\nStormy Daniels' agent reached a six-figure deal with then-National Enquirer editor Dylan Howard for the tabloid to acquire the rights to her story about a sexual encounter with Donald Trump after his \"Access Hollywood\" tape leaked, Keith Davidson testified Tuesday.\n\nBut then, according to Davidson, Howard backed out.\n\nThe editor instead told Daniels' agent, Gina Rodriguez, to call Michael Cohen and complete the deal directly with him -- but she refused to speak with Cohen after an uncomfortable prior interaction.\n\nRodriguez asked Davidson to step in and negotiate the deal with Cohen, the lawyer testified.\n\nDavidson added that he had numerous interactions with Howard over the years regarding stories. Asked if it was unusual for Howard to direct him to make a deal with a third party like Cohen, Davidson responded: \"This is the only time that ever happened.\"\n\n\"In essence, Michael Cohen stepped into AMI's shoes,\" Davidson said, referring to the name of the Enquirer's parent company at the time, American Media Inc.\n\nDavidson testified that in negotiating with Cohen, he hiked the price to $130,000 -- building in his fee for his work on the deal.\n\n'ACCESS HOLLYWOOD' TAPE LEAK MADE DANIELS' STORY MORE MARKETABLE, LAWYER SAYS\n\nStormy Daniels' story about a sexual encounter with Donald Trump became more marketable after the notorious \"Access Hollywood\" tape was leaked, Keith Davidson testified on Tuesday.\n\nDavidson, who previously represented Daniels, told prosecutors that Daniels' agent, Gina Rodriguez, had been trying to drum up interest in her story earlier in the 2016 election cycle but found there wasn't much.\n\nAsked to describe the \"Access Hollywood\" tape, which can't be shown in court, Davidson testified that it involved Trump and the show's then-host Billy Bush being recorded on a \"hot mic\" and \"some statements by both men that were troublesome.\"\n\n'HE WAS JUST SCREAMING,' LAWYER TESTIFIES OF FIRST INTERACTION WITH COHEN\n\nKeith Davidson on Tuesday testified that his first interaction with Michael Cohen related to a 2011 post on a gossip blog that stated that porn actor Stormy Daniels and Trump had \"some sort of physical or romantic interaction.\"\n\nAfter the blog post was published, Davidson said, Daniels' agent Gina Rodriguez called him and said, \"some jerk called me and was very, very aggressive and threatened to sue me.\"\n\nAsked who the \"jerk\" was, Davidson said: \"Michael Cohen.\"\n\nDavidson testified that when he called Cohen, the ex-Trump lawyer greeted him \"with a hostile barrage of insults and insinuations that went on for quite a while.\"\n\n\"I don't think he was accusing us of anything, he was just screaming,\" Davidson continued. \"Finally, after he finished, I explained to him that I was calling because my client, Stormy Daniels, did not want the story up. I wanted to see if he had done anything\" to try to get the story taken down.\n\nDavidson said he eventually sent a cease-and-desist letter to the blog after the dust up with Cohen and the story was removed.\n\nDAVIDSON SAYS HE UNDERSTOOD THE ENQUIRER WOULD NEVER PUBLISH MCDOUGAL'S STORY\n\nLawyer Keith Davidson testified on Tuesday that back-and-forth haggling took place in the selling of former Playboy model Karen McDougal's story to the National Enquirer.\n\nIn one text message shown to jurors, Davidson told Enquirer editor Dylan Howard that \"they are asking me to go back for another 25,\" meaning another $25,000. Howard responds with an expletive, adding, \"Not my money. I'll ask.\"\n\nBut even as they reached a basic framework for the deal, Davidson described his \"growing frustration with the process.\" At one point, Davidson said he was pushed to call Donald Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen directly, something he said he had been trying to avoid.\n\n\"I thought it was odd, certainly,\" Davidson said about being asked to call Cohen. \"I didn't particularly like dealing with him and that's why I was trying like hell to avoid talking to him,\" he added.\n\nDavidson testified that he understood McDougal's story would never be published and acknowledged that \"there was an unspoken understanding that there was an affiliation between David Pecker and Donald Trump and that AMI wouldn't run this story, any story related to Karen, because it would hurt Donald Trump.\"\n\nTRUMP'S ONLINE POSTS FOUND TO VIOLATE GAG ORDER HAVE BEEN REMOVED\n\nDonald Trump's online posts that on Tuesday were found to violate a gag order barring him from speaking publicly about jurors and witnesses in his criminal hush money trial were removed ahead of an afternoon deadline.\n\nThe posts in question were deleted while the court was in recess for lunch.\n\nLinks to the old Truth Social posts redirected to a \"Not found\" message, while those on Trump's website redirected to a 404 error page.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Judge Juan M. Merchan fined the former president $9,000 for the nine posts for violating the order.\n\nTEXAS AG PAXTON AMONG THOSE IN COURTROOM AS TRUMP'S TRIAL RESUMES\n\nCourt in Donald Trump's criminal trial resumed Tuesday after an early afternoon lunch break.\n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton walked into the courtroom with Trump and his entourage after posting on social media earlier in the day that he was there to support the former president. The Republican sat down in the first row of the courtroom gallery directly behind the defense table.\n\nPaxton sat just a few seats away from Trump's son Eric, who sat near the aisle alongside Susie Wiles, a Trump political operative.\n\nKeith Davidson, a lawyer who previously represented former Playboy model Karen McDougal and porn actor Stormy Daniels in hush money negotiations, was expected to returned to the witness stand.\n\nDAVIDSON SHEDS LIGHT ON SEQUENCE OF EVENTS THAT LED TO THE DEAL WITH THE ENQUIRER\n\nKeith Davidson testified Tuesday that after tipping off a National Enquirer editor about \"a blockbuster Trump story,\" he soon arranged a meeting with that editor, former Playboy model Karen McDougal and others to see whether the Enquirer's then-parent company was interested.\n\nAfter flying back to New York, Howard told him the Enquirer wasn't keen \"because Karen McDougal lacked documentary evidence of the interaction,\" Davidson testified.\n\nMcDougal had alleged that she had a year-long affair with Donald Trump years earlier.\n\nA month later, Enquirer editor Dylan Howard reached out again to Davidson, suggesting they resume discussions.\n\nAt the time, Davidson warned that the Enquirer's parent company would need to move quickly, writing in one text: \"Time is of the essence. The girl is being cornered by the estrogen mafia\"\n\nDavidson testified that McDougal was \"teetering\" at the time he sent the message and on the verge of signing a deal to tell her story to ABC News.\n\nDavidson also testified that he played the National Enquirer and ABC News against each other to get the best deal for his client. McDougal didn't want to tell her story publicly, which would've been required if she went to ABC, he said.\n\nJURY SEES TEXTS FROM LAWYER PROMISING TABLOID EDITOR A 'BLOCKBUSTER TRUMP STORY'\n\nIn his court testimony on Tuesday, attorney Keith Davidson described representing Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model, in her allegations of a year-long affair with Donald Trump.\n\nAs questioning turned toward Davidson's involvement in some of the hush money deals at the heart of the former president's criminal trial, he said he met McDougal 25 years ago through a friend. He said he started representing in 2016 \"to provide advice and counsel as to what her rights and obligations would be regarding a personal interaction that she had.\"\n\n\"With whom?\" prosecutor Joshua Steinglass asked.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"Donald Trump.\"\n\nShortly after Davidson began representing McDougal, he said, he reached out to Dylan Howard, the editor in chief of the National Enquirer, promising a \"blockbuster Trump story.\"\n\nHoward replied soon after: \"I will get you more than ANYONE for it. You know why.\"\n\nAs the text messages were displayed on screens to the jury, Davidson testified that he didn't know exactly what Howard meant at the time. But, he noted, \"I knew that Dylan's boss David Pecker and Mr. Trump were longtime friends and had a former business relationship,\" he said, adding the tabloid had effectively \"endorsed Mr. Trump's candidacy.\"\n\nSTORMY DANIELS' FORMER LAWYER CALLED TO THE STAND\n\nA lawyer who previously represented former Playboy model Karen McDougal and porn actor Stormy Daniels was the next witness called to the stand in Donald Trump's hush money trial.\n\nKeith Davidson took the stand shortly after noon Tuesday and is known for representing people trying to sell celebrity sex tapes or other embarrassing information.\n\nHe represented McDougal and Daniels in hush money negotiations with the National Enquirer and Trump's then-lawyer Michael Cohen in 2016.\n\nMcDougal claimed she had had a yearlong affair with Trump in the mid-2000s. Daniels claimed she had a one-time sexual encounter with him in 2006. Trump has denied both allegations.\n\nEXECUTIVE CA\n\nLLED TO THE STAND TO VERIFY TRANSCRIPT, VIDEO OF TRUMP DEPOSITION\n\nAn executive at a company that provides stenographers and videographers for depositions -- sworn, out-of-court statements under oath -- was the next witness called to the stand in Donald Trump's criminal trial on Tuesday.\n\nPhillip Thompson was called to authenticate a transcript and video of a deposition the former president gave in one of writer E. Jean Carroll's federal defamation lawsuits against him.\n\nThe portions included Carroll's lawyer asking Trump about his Truth Social platform, the dates of his marriage to wife Melania Trump and whether he was aware of the \"Access Hollywood\" tape.\n\nThe former longtime Elle magazine advice columnist had alleged that Trump sexually assaulted her in the 1990s and then defamed her after she came forward publicly in 2019. He has said nothing happened between the two of them and called her a \"wack job\" who engineered a \"hoax\" to sell a book.\n\nAfter two federal trials last year and this winter, juries awarded Carroll over $88 million. Trump is appealing.\n\nVIDEOS OF TRUMP DENYING ALLEGATIONS AND PRAISING COHEN PLAYED IN COURT\n\nProsecutors in Donald Trump's hush money case played C-SPAN clips on Tuesday of the then-presidential candidate on the campaign trail in the final weeks leading up to the 2016 election. In the videos, Trump forcefully denied allegations made by several women after his infamous 2005 \"Access Hollywood\" tape was made public.\n\n\"The stories are total fiction. They're 100% made up, they never happened, they never would happen,\" Trump said in video from an Oct. 14, 2016 rally in North Carolina.\n\nAnother clip played for the jury, from January 2017, showed Trump praising Michael Cohen as as good lawyer and friend.\n\nTrump did not appear to react in court to the clips, which were played on monitors throughout the courtroom, including directly in front of him on the defense table.\n\nAfter confirming the veracity of the clips, Robert Browning -- the executive director of C-SPAN's archives -- was dismissed from the witness stand. Trump's attorneys declined to question him.\n\nEXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF C-SPAN ARCHIVES CALLED TO THE STAND\n\nThe next witness called to the stand Tuesday in Donald Trump's hush money trial was Robert Browning, the executive director of the C-SPAN archives.\n\nBrowning, who manages the network's video collection, was called to verify the authenticity of video of a Trump campaign event.\n\nProsecutors are calling people who are regarded as \"records custodians\" to verify evidence in the former president's criminal case.\n\nTRIAL WILL BREAK FOR 4 DAYS OVER MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND\n\nDonald Trump's hush money trial will get an extra day off for the Memorial Day weekend next month.\n\nCourt won't be in session on Friday, May 24, to accommodate a juror who has a flight that morning, Judge Juan M. Merchan said on Tuesday.\n\nThat means the trial will be off for four straight days for the holiday weekend, resuming on Tuesday, May 28. Merchan also informed jurors there will not be court on May 17, though he didn't give them a reason.\n\nThat's the day Donald Trump will be attending his son Barron's high school graduation.\n\nPROSECUTORS WANT TO QUESTION TRUMP ABOUT GAG ORDER VIOLATIONS IF HE TESTIFIES\n\nAhead of a midday break in Donald Trump's hush money case, prosecutors asked the judge to let them question the former president about his gag order violations should he choose to testify.\n\nThe request came after Judge Juan M. Merchan ruled Tuesday morning that Trump had on nine occasions violated a court mandate barring him from speaking publicly about witnesses and jurors in the case. He ultimately fined Trump $9,000 and will hold another hearing Thursday on four more alleged gag order violations.\n\nProsecutors also requested permission to introduce evidence they said shows Trump orchestrated a \"pressure campaign and intimidation effort\" against Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels.\n\nColangelo said Trump's attorney opened the door to that evidence by seeking to undermine the credibility of the two witnesses in opening statements.\n\nMerchan did not immediately rule, but said, \"the door has been opened.\"\n\nHe previously ruled to allow prosecutors to challenge Trump's credibility by questioning him about a limited number of his recent legal setbacks if he ends up taking the witness stand.\n\nTrump has said he wants to testify, but is under no obligation to do so.\n\nNO RED FLAGS ABOUT COHEN'S ACCOUNTS AT THE TIME, FARRO SAYS\n\nIn his cross examination of banker Gary Farro on Tuesday, defense attorney Todd Blanche underscored that Michael Cohen made no mention that the accounts he opened in October 2016 had anything to do with deals involving then-presidential candidate Donald Trump or his company.\n\nIf Cohen had done so, \"I would have asked questions,\" Farro said.\n\nFarro noted that he might not have opened a bank account for Cohen if he'd been told it was for what's known as a shell corporation -- one that receives and sends out money but doesn't have an underlying business.\n\nBut Cohen, the banker said, told him the account was for a real estate consulting business.\n\nNothing about it raised \"any red flags to you?\" Blanche asked.\n\n\"Not based upon the answers I was given to the questions I asked,\" Farro said.\n\nFarro's testimony shed light on his role in helping Cohen open a bank account that was later used to process a $130,000 wire transfer to a lawyer for Stormy Daniels.\n\nDEFENSE BEGINS CROSS-EXAMINATION OF FARRO\n\nDefense attorneys began their cross-examination of Gary Farro, the prosecution's third witness in Donald Trump's hush money trial, by asking the banker to describe his relationship with Michael Cohen.\n\nFarro said he first met Cohen -- then serving as the former president's personal lawyer -- in person at a meeting in Trump Tower, but primarily communicated over the phone. Pushed by Todd Blanche, Farro acknowledged that Cohen wasn't always easy to work with.\n\n\"He was a challenging client because of his desire to get things done so quickly,\" Farro said. \"Ninety percent of the time it was an urgent matter.\"\n\nPROSECUTORS WRAP QUESTIONING OF FARRO\n\nProsecutors have wrapped up questioning of Gary Farro, their third witness in Donald Trump's criminal hush money trial.\n\nFarro told prosecutors on Tuesday that Michael Cohen had indicated that a 2016 $130,000 wire payment now at the heart of the case was related to a real estate transaction -- not a political candidate, an adult film performer or buying up a potential media story.\n\n\"We might consider something like that a reputational risk,\" Farro said.\n\nWithin a day of opening the Essential Consultants LLC bank account on Oct. 26, 2016 -- and funding it with about $130,000 from his own home equity loan -- Cohen wired out $130,000 to Keith Davidson, then a lawyer for Stormy Daniels, documents showed.\n\nThe 2016 presidential election was on Nov. 8.\n\nFAMILY JOINS TRUMP IN COURT FOR THE FIRST TIME\n\nDonald Trump's son Eric joined his father in court on Tuesday, marking the first time any of the former president's family members have attended his criminal hush money trial.\n\nPrior to court proceedings resuming, Trump turned from the defense table and walked over to his son in the first row of the gallery. Trump put his hand on Eric's arm as they chatted.\n\nTrump had railed about the trial, as well as his other legal cases, to reporters on his way into the courtroom earlier in the morning.\n\nFARRO RETURNS TO THE STAND\n\nTestimony in Donald Trump's hush money trial resumed with Gary Farro, a banker who helped Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen open accounts. Cohen used one such account to buy the silence of porn performer Stormy Daniels in the weeks before the 2016 election. She alleged a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump, which he denies.\n\nCohen indicated the account, opened in late October 2016 in the name of Essential Consultants LLC, would be used for real estate consulting, according to testimony and documents shown at the trial.\n\nIn response to prosecutor Becky Mangold's questions, Farro said the bank would have asked more questions if there had been any mention of a connection to a political candidate, buying a story that was being pitched to the media or paying a porn performer.\n\nThe additional scrutiny would have delayed or even nixed opening the account, which Cohen had wanted to open right away. In particular, the adult film world \"is an industry we don't work with,\" he said.\n\nWith only real estate in the picture, the account was opened within a day -- \"very quick,\" Farro said.\n\nMERCHAN FINDS POST ABOUT COHEN AND DANIELS WAS NOT A VIOLATION\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan found that one of Donald Trump's online posts about his former lawyer Michael Cohen and porn actor Stormy Daniels did not violate a gag order barring him from speaking publicly about jurors and witnesses in his hush money case.\n\nMerchan wrote that he was finding Trump \"in criminal contempt for willfully disobeying a lawful mandate\" of the court on nine separate occasions for posts made on Truth Social and his campaign website.\n\nMerchan ruled that Trump's April 10 post referring to Cohen and Daniels as \"sleaze bags\" was not a gag order violation. He said Trump's contention that he was responding to previous posts by Cohen \"is sufficient to give\" him pause \"as to whether the People have met their burden\" as to that post.\n\nHowever, the other nine \"attack the credibility of arguably two of the more high-profile witnesses in this case.\"\n\n\"To allow such attacks upon protected witnesses with blanket assertions that they are all responses to 'political attacks' would be an exception that swallowed the rule. The Expanded Order does not contain such an exception,\" Merchan wrote.\n\nJUDGE FINDS TRUMP VIOLATED GAG ORDER, FINES HIM $9K\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan ruled Tuesday morning that Donald Trump violated a gag order barring him from making public statements about witnesses and jurors in his hush money trial nine times. He fined the former president $9,000 for the violations.\n\nProsecutors had alleged the former president had violated the order 10 times, and Merchan concurred in all but one of those instances. The judge will hold a hearing Thursday on four more alleged violations.\n\nThe former president stared down at the table in front of him as Merchan read the ruling, frowning slightly but otherwise showing no expression.\n\nMerchan wrote in his ruling that Trump \"is hereby warned that the Court will not tolerate continued willful violations of its lawful orders\" and raised the possibility of jail time if \"necessary and appropriate under the circumstances.\"\n\nJUDGE TO ALLOW TRUMP TO ATTEND SON'S GRADUATION\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan said Tuesday morning that Donald Trump's criminal hush money trial will not be held on May 17 so that the former president can attend his son's graduation.\n\n\"I don't think the May 17 date is a problem, so Mr. Trump can certainly attend that date, attend his son's graduation,\" Merchan said.\n\nTrump had previously requested the day off from court to accommodate his son Barron's high school graduation.\n\nTRUMP ARRIVES AT COURT\n\nDonald Trump's motorcade arrived Tuesday morning at the courthouse in lower Manhattan just before 9 a.m., kicking off the second week of witness testimony in the former president's hush money trial.\n\nA crowd of around 60 Trump supporters had gathered across the street from the building, waving Trump and American flags on tall poles.\n\nTRUMP LEAVES TRUMP TOWER FOR COURT\n\nDonald Trump entered his motorcade outside Trump Tower in midtown, headed to the courthouse in lower Manhattan for the second week of trial testimony.\n\nThe former president on Tuesday will be in court for testimony from the third prosecution witness, Gary Farro, a banker who helped Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen open accounts.\n\nCohen used one to buy the silence of porn performer Stormy Daniels. She alleged a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump, which he denies.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

        "text": "Good morning. We start today with another development in China's efforts to revive momentum in the world's second-largest economy.\n\nChina's Politburo, the Communist party's 24-member leadership body, has pledged more support for the economy, saying it \"still faces many challenges\" even as high-tech manufacturing helped factory activity expand for a second consecutive month in April.\n\nIn a meeting yesterday, China's leaders laid out measures to shore up growth and announced that a long-awaited important policy gathering, the Third Plenum, would be held in July.\n\n\"The economy still faces many challenges as it continues to rebound, mainly due to insufficient effective demand . . . and the complexity, severity and uncertainty of the external environment have significantly increased,\" the meeting concluded, according to state-owned news agency Xinhua.\n\nThe FT's Joe Leahy and William Sundland have more on the Politburo measures, plus a closer look at the latest data release.\n\nHere's what else I'm keeping tabs on today:\n\n1. HSBC chief executive Noel Quinn is retiring, setting off a hunt for a successor at the London-headquartered bank. Quinn has overhauled the lender since taking charge in 2019, selling off parts of its global operations to increase its focus on Asia, where it makes the lion's share of its profits. Here's why he's leaving, and what's ahead for HSBC.\n\n2. Elon Musk has shut down the division that runs Tesla's Supercharger business, dismissed two senior executives and fired hundreds more staff. Tesla's supercharger system is among the largest charging networks in the world, and was one of the reasons the company enjoyed such a commanding lead over rival carmakers for so long. Here's more on the surprising decision.\n\n3. The Japanese government appears to have deployed roughly $35bn supporting the yen on Monday, according to money market data released by the Bank of Japan. The data all but confirmed the market intervention by Japanese authorities shortly after the yen hit a 34-year low of just under ¥160 against the US dollar. The scale of the probable intervention underscores the government's unease with a sharp slide in the yen this year.\n\n4. Former Binance chief executive Changpeng Zhao has been sentenced to four months in jail after pleading guilty to failing to establish adequate money laundering controls at the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange. Zhao resigned as head of Binance in November, while the exchange paid $4.3bn for failing to halt transactions that financed terrorist groups Hamas and al-Qaeda and sanctioned entities in Iran and Russia, among other violations.\n\n5. Two Société Générale traders in Hong Kong left the group last year after the French bank discovered unauthorised derivatives trades that could have lost it money in a severe market downturn. The person who made the trades in Hong Kong had placed risky bets on options contracts linked to Indian stock market indices that they had not been authorised to carry out, a person familiar with the details said.\n\nElon Musk appears to be on the cusp of deploying Tesla's \"full self-driving\" system in China, the world's biggest car market. The breakthrough comes after an unexpected visit earlier this week to Beijing, where Musk met Chinese premier Li Qiang before sealing a deal with Chinese tech giant Baidu to use the group's mapping and navigation systems. Here's what the billionaire's trip to China means for Tesla -- and why helping the US electric-car maker is important to Beijing.\n\nApple has poached dozens of artificial intelligence experts from Google and has created a secretive European laboratory in Zurich. According to an FT analysis, the $2.7tn company has undertaken a hiring spree over recent years to expand its global AI and machine learning team -- and Google has been its top target.\n\nChinese restaurants have long been the backbone of New York City cuisine, and today a new generation of restaurateurs is reinventing or playing with American expectations of the cuisine. Here are five of New York's most exciting new-wave Chinese restaurants.",

A new Repair State feature will keep Find My enabled throughout the repair process.\n\nCode referencing the feature was originally discovered by 9to5mac in the latest iOS 17.5 beta, which was released on Tuesday to authorized developers. The new feature aims make repairs easier for both consumers and repair technicians, by eliminating the requirement for Find My removal.\n\nBefore Repair State, requiring Find My to be disabled ensured that neither Apple nor an authorized service center ends up unknowingly working on a stolen iPhone\n\nWith iOS 17.3 Apple introduced a security delay as a part of Stolen Device Protection, which requires users to wait an extra hour before FindMy can be disabled when away from significant locations. It is a feature that prevents unauthorized users from changing the user's password or accessing critical data.\n\nDealing with said time delay will no longer be necessary with the new Repair State feature, but it appears to lack a critical component -- there is currently no way of disabling the feature in the beta.\n\nHowever, that may be a feature and not a bug. Apple may not have implemented an option to exit the Repair State except by authorized repair technicians.\n\niOS 17.5 remains a relatively minor update, as Apple is expected to announce its next generation of operating systems at WWDC on June 10.\n\nRead on AppleInsider",

While the Solo range is perhaps Beats' best-known headphones, they have been largely neglected and have gone without the technology that has come to the rest of the company's products.\n\nUpdates include new drivers in the earphones, and USB-C for both charging and higher quality music, and a re-engineered hardware design that Beats said would improve the sound. They also get updates from other Apple and Beats headphones, including personalised spatial audio.\n\nThe Beats Solo 4 cost £199 or $199. They are available now.\n\nAlongside the headphones, Beats has released new Solo Buds, which put true wireless earphones in a cheap and tiny package that Beats said was its smallest earphone ever. They cost £79 or $79 and will be available in June.\n\nThey do lose out on some key features from Beats' and parent company Apple's other earphones, such as noise cancellation. But they do include some smart features including smart switching across devices and Find My support.\n\nBeats claimed that \"custom-build acoustic architecture\" meant that the earbuds would still sound big despite their small size and relatively cheap price.\n\n\"Our newly expanded Solo line delivers remarkable value, offering exceptional sound quality, battery life and comfort in our most portable designs,\" said Oliver Schusser, Apple's vice president of Apple Music, Apple TV+, sports, and Beats.\n\n\"Beats Solo 4 takes our bestselling headphone to the next level with outstanding performance upgrades, and the all-new Beats Solo Buds pack impressive power in our smallest product yet.\"",

        "text": "Apple announced two new offerings to its Beats line of headphones and earbuds. The Beats Solo Buds are a pair of true wireless earphones that promise up to 18 hours of battery life, while the Beats Solo 4 is an upgrade for those looking to swap their current over-the-ear cans for something new. Both devices are more affordable than the three tiers of AirPods. They're lighter and smaller, as well.\n\nThe Beats Solo Buds cost $80 and come in four colors: black, gray, purple, and a nostalgic-seeming transparent red. The buds have touch controls on the outside and can pair with Android and iOS devices. The Beats Solo Buds case charges via USB-C, and Apple says it's one of the smallest cases it has ever made.\n\nRhe Beats Solo Buds come with Spatial Audio and a \"custom-built acoustic architecture.\" They're purported to be more comfortable to wear than their predecessors, with four different ear tips included in the box. But they don't have active noise cancellation (ANC), which is likely why these buds can get so much life in one charge. The Solo Buds are compatible with Apple's Find My and Android's Find My Device.\n\nApple mentions in the fine print that the 18-hour battery promise comes from testing the Beats Solo Buds with the iPhone 15 Pro. We'll see if the promise extends to Android devices. The Solo Buds will be available in June.\n\nIf you don't like buds, the Beats Solo 4 is a set of over-the-ear plushy headphones. Apple says the pair offer an \"ultralight design\" weighing around 7 ounces -- for comparison, the AirPods Max weigh twice as much.\n\nThe Beats Solo 4 can be connected to a device in several ways: Bluetooth, USB-C, or a 3.5mm audio jack, an excellent option for saving battery life. The headphones claim up to 50 hours of battery on a charge. They cost $200 and will start to ship on May 2.",

        "text": "E. coli is an archetypal commensal bacterial species that lives in mammalian intestines. E. coli O157:H7 is one of thousands of serotypes Escherichia coli. The combination of letters and numbers in the name of the E. coli O157:H7 refers to the specific antigens (proteins which provoke an antibody response) found on the body and tail or flagellumrespectively and distinguish it from other types of E. coli. Most serotypes of E. coli are harmless and live as normal flora in the intestines of healthy humans and animals. The E. coli bacterium is among the most extensively studied microorganism. The testing done to distinguish E. coli O157:H7 from its other E. coli counterparts is called serotyping. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE),sometimes also referred to as genetic fingerprinting, is used to compare E. coli O157:H7 isolates to determine if the strains are distinguishable. A technique called multilocus variable number of tandem repeats analysis (MLVA) is used to determine precise classification when it is difficult to differentiate between isolates with indistinguishable or very similar PFGE patterns.\n\nE. coli O157:H7 was first recognized as a pathogen in 1982 during an investigation into an outbreak of hemorrhagic colitisassociated with consumption of hamburgers from a fast food chain restaurant. Retrospective examination of more than three thousand E. coli culturesobtained between 1973 and 1982 found only one (1) isolationwith serotype O157:H7, and that was a casein 1975. In the ten (10) years that followed there were approximately thirty (30) outbreaks recorded in the United States. This number is likely misleading, however, because E. coliO157:H7 infections did not become a reportable disease in any state until 1987 when Washington became the first state to mandate its reporting to public health authorities. As a result, only the most geographically concentrated outbreak would have garnered enough notice to prompt further investigation.\n\nThe E. coli O157:H7 Bacteria\n\nE. coli O157:H7's ability to induce injury in humans is a result of its ability to produce numerous virulence factors, most notably Shiga-like toxins. Shiga toxin (Stx) has multiple variants (e.g. Stx1, Stx2, Stx2c), and acts like the plant toxin ricin by inhibiting protein synthesis in endothelial and other cells. Shiga toxin is one of the most potent toxins known. In addition to Shiga toxins, E. coli O157:H7 produces numerous other putative virulence factors including proteins, which aid in the attachment and colonization of the bacteria in the intestinal wall and which can lyse red blood cells and liberate iron to help support E. coli metabolism.\n\nE. coli O157:H7 evolved from enteropathogenic E. coli serotype O55:H7, a cause of non-bloody diarrhea, through the sequential acquisition of phage-encoded Stx2, a large virulence plasmid, and additional chromosomal mutations.The rate of genetic mutation of E. coli O157:H7 indicates that the common ancestor of current E. coli O157:H7 clades likely existed some 20,000 years ago. E. coli O157:H7 is a relentlessly evolving organism, constantly mutating and acquiring new characteristics, including virulence factors that make the emergence of more dangerous variants a constant threat. The CDC has emphasized the prospect of emerging pathogens as a significant public health threat for some time.\n\nAlthough foods of a bovine origin are the most common cause of both outbreaks and sporadic cases of E. coliO157:H7 infections, outbreak of illnesses have been linked to a wide variety of food items. For example, produce has, since at least 1991, been the source of substantial numbers of outbreak-related E. coli O157:H7 infections. Other unusual vehicles for E. coli O157:H7 outbreaks have included unpasteurized juices, yogurt, dried salami, mayonnaise, raw milk, game meats, sprouts, and raw cookie dough.\n\nAccording to a recent study, an estimated 93,094 illnesses are due to domestically acquired E. coli O157:H7 each year in the United States. Estimates of foodborne acquired O157:H7 cases result in 2,138 hospitalizations and 20 deaths annually. The colitis caused by E. coli O157:H7 is characterized by severe abdominal cramps, diarrhea that typically turns bloody within twenty-four (24) hours, and sometimes fevers. The incubation period -- which is to say the time from exposure to the onset of symptoms -- in outbreaks is usually reported as three (3) to four (4) days, but may be as short as one (1) day or as long as ten (10) days. Infection can occur in people of all ages but is most common in children. The duration of an uncomplicated illness can range from one (1) to twelve (12) days. In reported outbreaks, the rate of death is 0-2%, with rates running as high as 16-35% in outbreaks involving the elderly, like those have occurred at nursing homes.\n\nWhat makes E. coli O157:H7 remarkably dangerous is its very low infectious dose, and how relatively difficult it is to kill these bacteria. Unlike Salmonella, for example, which usually requires something approximating an \"egregious food handling error, E. coli O157:H7 in ground beef that is only slightly undercooked can result in infection,\" as few as twenty (20) organisms may be sufficient to infect a person and, as a result, possibly kill them. And unlike generic E. coli, the O157:H7 serotype multiplies at temperatures up to 44°F, survives freezing and thawing, is heat resistant, grows at temperatures up to 111°F, resists drying, and can survive exposure to acidic environments.\n\nAnd, finally, to make it even more of a threat, E. coli O157:H7 bacteria are easily transmitted by person-to-person contact. There is also the serious risk of cross-contamination between raw meat and other food items intended to be eaten without cooking. Indeed, a principle and consistent criticism of the USDA E. coli O157:H7 policy is the fact that it has failed to focus on the risks of cross-contamination versus that posed by so-called improper cooking. With this pathogen, there is ultimately no margin of error. It is for this precise reason that the USDA has repeatedly rejected calls from the meat industry to hold consumers primarily responsible for E. coli O157:H7 infections caused, in part, by mistakes in food handling or cooking.\n\nHemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS)\n\nE. coli O157:H7 infections can lead to a severe, life-threatening complication called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). HUS accounts for the majority of the acute deaths and chronic injuries caused by the bacteria. HUS occurs in 2-7% of victims, primarily children, with onset five to ten days after diarrhea begins. It is the most common cause of renal failure in children. Approximately half of the children who suffer HUS require dialysis, and at least 5% of those who survive have long term renal impairment. The same number suffers severe brain damage. While somewhat rare, serious injury to the pancreas, resulting in death or the development of diabetes, can also occur. There is no cure or effective treatment for HUS.\n\nHUS is believed to develop when the toxin from the bacteria, known as Shiga-like toxin (SLT), enters the circulation through the inflamed bowel wall. SLT, and most likely other chemical mediators, attach to receptors on the inside surface of blood vessel cells (endothelial cells) and initiate a chemical cascade that results in the formation of tiny thrombi (blood clots) within these vessels. Some organs seem more susceptible, perhaps due to the presence of increased numbers of receptors, and include the kidney, pancreas, and brain. By definition, when fully expressed, HUS presents with the triad of hemolytic anemia (destruction of red blood cells), thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), and renal failure (loss of kidney function). As already noted, there is no known therapy to halt the progression of HUS. HUS is a frightening complication that even in the best American centers has a notable mortality rate. Among survivors, at least five percent will suffer end stage renal disease (ESRD) with the resultant need for dialysis or transplantation. But, \"[b]ecause renal failure can progress slowly over decades, the eventual incidence of ESRD cannot yet be determined.\" Other long-term problems include the risk for hypertension, proteinuria (abnormal amounts of protein in the urine that can portend a decline in renal function), and reduced kidney filtration rate. Since the longest available follow-up studies of HUS victims are 25 years, an accurate lifetime prognosis is not readily available and remains controversial. All that can be said for certain is that HUS causes permanent injury, including loss of kidney function, and it requires a lifetime of close medical-monitoring.\n\nThe term reactive arthritis refers to an inflammation of one or more joints, following an infection localized at another site distant from the affected joints. The predominant site of the infection is the gastrointestinal tract. Several bacteria, including E. coli, induce septic arthritis. The resulting joint pain and inflammation can resolve completely over time or permanent joint damage can occur.\n\nThe reactive arthritis associated with Reiter syndrome may develop after a person eats food that has been tainted with bacteria. In a small number of persons, the joint inflammation is accompanied by conjunctivitis (inflammation of the eyes), and urethritis (painful urination). Id. This triad of symptoms is called Reiter syndrome. Reiter syndrome, a form of reactive arthritis, is an uncommon but debilitating syndrome caused by gastrointestinal or genitourinary infections. The most common gastrointestinal bacteria involved are Salmonella, Campylobacter, Yersinia, and Shigella. Reiter syndrome is characterized by a triad of arthritis, conjunctivitis, and urethritis, although not all three symptoms occur in all affected individuals.\n\nAlthough the initial infection may not be recognized, reactive arthritis can still occur. Reactive arthritis typically involves inflammation of one joint (monoarthritis) or four or fewer joints (oligoarthritis), preferentially affecting those of the lower extremities; the pattern of joint involvement is usually asymmetric. Inflammation is common at entheses - i.e., the places where ligaments and tendons attach to bone, especially the knee and the ankle.\n\nSalmonella has been the most frequently studied bacteria associated with reactive arthritis. Overall, studies have found rates of Salmonella-associated reactive arthritis to vary between 6 and 30%. The frequency of postinfectious Reiter syndrome, however, has not been well described. In a Washington State study, while 29% developed arthritis, only 3% developed the triad of symptoms associated with Reiter syndrome. In addition, individuals of Caucasian descent may be more likely those of Asian descent to develop reactive arthritis, and children may be less susceptible than adults to reactive arthritis following infection with Salmonella.\n\nA clear association has been made between reactive arthritis and a genetic factor called the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) B27 genotype. HLA is the major histocompatibility complex in humans; these are proteins present on the surface of all body cells that contain a nucleus and are in especially high concentrations in white blood cells (leukocytes). It is thought that HLA-B27 may affect the elimination of the infecting bacteria or an individual's immune response.HLA-B27 has been shown to be a predisposing factor in one-half to over two-thirds of individuals with reactive arthritis. While HLA-B27 does not appear to predispose to the initial infection itself, it increases the risk of developing arthritis that is more likely to be severe and prolonged. This risk may be slightly greater for Salmonella and Yersinia-associated arthritis than with Campylobacter, but more research is required to clarify this.\n\nIrritable Bowel Syndrome\n\nA recently published study surveyed the extant scientific literature and noted that post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS) is a common clinical phenomenon first-described over five decades ago. The Walkerton Health Study further notes that:\n\nBetween 5% and 30% of patients who suffer an acute episode of infectious gastroenteritis develop chronic gastrointestinal symptoms despite clearance of the inciting pathogens.\n\nIn terms of its own data, the \"study confirm[ed] a strong and significant relationship between acute enteric infection and subsequent IBS symptoms.\" The WHS also identified risk-factors for subsequent IBS, including younger age; female sex; and four features of the acute enteric illness - diarrhea for > 7days, presence of blood in stools, abdominal cramps, and weight loss of at least ten pounds.\n\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic disorder characterized by alternating bouts of constipation and diarrhea, both of which are generally accompanied by abdominal cramping and pain. In one recent study, over one-third of IBS sufferers had had IBS for more than ten years, with their symptoms remaining constant over time. IBS sufferers typically experienced symptoms for an average of 8.1 days per month.\n\nAs would be expected from a chronic disorder with symptoms of such persistence, IBS sufferers required more time off work, spent more days in bed, and more often cut down on usual activities, when compared with non-IBS sufferers. And even when able to work, a significant majority (67%), felt less productive at work because of their symptoms. IBS symptoms also have a significantly deleterious impact on social well-being and daily social activities, such as undertaking a long drive, going to a restaurant, or taking a vacation. Finally, although a patient's psychological state may influence the way in which he or she copes with illness and responds to treatment, there is no evidence that supports the theory that psychological disturbances in fact cause IBS or its symptoms.\n\nE. coli bacteria were discovered in the human colon in 1885 by German bacteriologist Theodor Escherich.

As a result, the shares, which had fallen more than 3% in Tuesday's sell-off, could only manage a 2.9% gain in sparse after-hours dealings.\n\nThe online giant revealed better-than-expected earnings and revenue for the first quarter, driven by growth in advertising and cloud computing, and of course, by cost-cutting.\n\nAmazon has chopped off more than 27,000 employees since late 2022, with the cuts bleeding into 2024. During the first quarter, Amazon let go hundreds of staffers in its health and AWS businesses and made significant cuts in Prime TV, Prime itself, and other businesses.\n\nRevenue rose to $US143.3 billion, up 13% from $US127.4 billion a year ago, and operating income soared more than 200% to $US15.3 billion, far outpacing revenue growth. Investors said that was the big positive from the results and a solid sign that the company's cost-cutting measures in 2022 and 2023 are now bolstering its bottom line. The cloud business, AWS, though accounted for 62% of total operating profit. Net income also more than tripled to $10.4 billion, from $US3.17 billion. Amazon said it expects a continued jump in profitability for the current second quarter but at a more measured (slower) pace. The company said operating income will be $US10 billion to $US14 billion, up from $US7.7 billion a year earlier. Revenue in the current quarter will be $US144 billion to $US149 billion, or growth of 7% to 11%. Analysts were expecting growth of 12% to $US150.1 billion, which is why the forecast was seen as a bit weak.\n\nThe rebound at AWS stood out; Amazon said sales in the division surged 17% in the first quarter to $US25 billion, topping forecasts for sales growth of 12% to $US24.5 billion. For Amazon, it was a welcome return to sales growth for AWS after a sluggish year in 2023. Demand for cloud services is being driven by AI, according to the company.\n\nDespite media hints at a dividend re-release (joining the likes of Meta, Alphabet, and Apple among the megatechs in paying dividends), there was nothing from Amazon. Also, unlike other megatechs, there was no buyback news from Amazon in its results release.",

Prosecutors say Trump obscured the true nature of those payments and falsely recorded them as legal expenses.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.\n\nThe case is the first-ever criminal trial of a former U.S. president and the first of four prosecutions of Trump to reach a jury.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- Key players: Who's who at Donald Trump's hush money criminal trial\n\n-- The hush money case is just one of Trump's legal cases.

Merchan of bias and of rushing the case, and also saying he should be out campaigning.\n\nTrump was found in contempt of court earlier in the day and fined $9,000 for nine violations of the gag order, which bars him from speaking publicly about witnesses and jurors in the case.\n\nDAVIDSON SAYS HE THOUGHT DANIELS' STORY WOULD 'BE A TORNADO' IF IT GOT OUT\n\nKeith Davidson and Dylan Howard, then-editor of the National Enquirer, texted each other about what Howard called an \"impending storm\" of publicity if Stormy Daniels took her story elsewhere after Michael Cohen failed to make a payment in the deal on time, according to Davidson's testimony and documents shown at the trial on Tuesday.\n\nDavidson wrote to Howard that he believed Daniels and her agent had agreed to bring her story about a sexual encounter with Donald Trump to another publication, and \"I think it'll be a full-on blitz.\"\n\n\"I just felt like there was going to be more than a flurry of activity. I felt like it was going to be a tornado,\" Davidson explained in court.\n\n\"If the story got out,\" Steinglass asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Davidson said.\n\nAsked if Cohen ever told him who he was representing in the Daniels negotiations, Davidson said that he may not have explicitly stated he was working on Trump's behalf -- but the implication was clear.\n\nCOHEN MISSED DEADLINE TO PAY $130K TO STORMY DANIELS, DAVIDSON SAYS\n\nBefore a brief afternoon break in Donald Trump's hush money trial, lawyer Keith Davidson testified Tuesday that Michael Cohen missed an agreed upon deadline for sending a $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels.\n\nAt first, Cohen offered a litany of explanations for the delay, at turns blaming broken computers, Secret Service \"firewalls,\" and the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur. \"The things he was saying didn't really make sense,\" Davidson said of Cohen.\n\nAs the excuses piled up, Davidson said he understood that Cohen \"didn't have the authority to actually spend money.\" He eventually sent an email informing Cohen that the deal involving Daniel's story about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump was off.\n\n\"I thought he was trying to kick the can down the round until after the election,\" Davidson said.\n\nAPPELLATE COURT REJECTS TRUMP'S REQUEST TO STAY HUSH MONEY TRIAL\n\nAs testimony continued in Donald Trump's hush money trial on Tuesday, a five-judge panel in New York state's mid-level appellate court rejected the former president's request for a stay of the proceedings while he appeals several pretrial rulings, including the trial judge's refusal to recuse himself.\n\nTrump had sought the stay prior to the start of jury selection. A lone judge in the appeals court had previously rejected a request for an emergency stay halting the trial.\n\nPSEUDONYMS WERE USED TO DISGUISE PARTIES INVOLVED IN ENQUIRER DEAL, LAWYER TESTIFIES\n\nIn drawing up the deal with the National Enquirer involving Stormy Daniels' story about an alleged sexual encounter with Donald Trump, Keith Davidson testified Tuesday that he used pseudonyms to disguise the parties involved.\n\nStormy Daniels became Peggy Peterson and Donald Trump became David Dennison, according to Davidson.\n\nThe alliterative code names were picked, in part, because Daniels was the plaintiff and Trump was the defendant, the lawyer testified.\n\nAsked by prosecutors in Trump's hush money case if David Dennison was a real person, Davidson said that he played on his high school hockey team.\n\n\"And how does he feel about you now?\" asked prosecutor Josh Steinglass.\n\nDavidson stifled a laugh, then answered: \"He's very upset.\"\n\n'MICHAEL COHEN STEPPED INTO AMI'S SHOES,' DAVIDSON SAYS\n\nStormy Daniels' agent reached a six-figure deal with then-National Enquirer editor Dylan Howard for the tabloid to acquire the rights to her story about a sexual encounter with Donald Trump after his \"Access Hollywood\" tape leaked, Keith Davidson testified Tuesday.\n\nBut then, according to Davidson, Howard backed out.\n\nThe editor instead told Daniels' agent, Gina Rodriguez, to call Michael Cohen and complete the deal directly with him -- but she refused to speak with Cohen after an uncomfortable prior interaction.\n\nRodriguez asked Davidson to step in and negotiate the deal with Cohen, the lawyer testified.\n\nDavidson added that he had numerous interactions with Howard over the years regarding stories. Asked if it was unusual for Howard to direct him to make a deal with a third party like Cohen, Davidson responded: \"This is the only time that ever happened.\"\n\n\"In essence, Michael Cohen stepped into AMI's shoes,\" Davidson said, referring to the name of the Enquirer's parent company at the time, American Media Inc.\n\nDavidson testified that in negotiating with Cohen, he hiked the price to $130,000 -- building in his fee for his work on the deal.\n\n'ACCESS HOLLYWOOD' TAPE LEAK MADE DANIELS' STORY MORE MARKETABLE, LAWYER SAYS\n\nStormy Daniels' story about a sexual encounter with Donald Trump became more marketable after the notorious \"Access Hollywood\" tape was leaked, Keith Davidson testified on Tuesday.\n\nDavidson, who previously represented Daniels, told prosecutors that Daniels' agent, Gina Rodriguez, had been trying to drum up interest in her story earlier in the 2016 election cycle but found there wasn't much.\n\nAsked to describe the \"Access Hollywood\" tape, which can't be shown in court, Davidson testified that it involved Trump and the show's then-host Billy Bush being recorded on a \"hot mic\" and \"some statements by both men that were troublesome.\"\n\n'HE WAS JUST SCREAMING,' LAWYER TESTIFIES OF FIRST INTERACTION WITH COHEN\n\nKeith Davidson on Tuesday testified that his first interaction with Michael Cohen related to a 2011 post on a gossip blog that stated that porn actor Stormy Daniels and Trump had \"some sort of physical or romantic interaction.\"\n\nAfter the blog post was published, Davidson said, Daniels' agent Gina Rodriguez called him and said, \"some jerk called me and was very, very aggressive and threatened to sue me.\"\n\nAsked who the \"jerk\" was, Davidson said: \"Michael Cohen.\"\n\nDavidson testified that when he called Cohen, the ex-Trump lawyer greeted him \"with a hostile barrage of insults and insinuations that went on for quite a while.\"\n\n\"I don't think he was accusing us of anything, he was just screaming,\" Davidson continued. \"Finally, after he finished, I explained to him that I was calling because my client, Stormy Daniels, did not want the story up. I wanted to see if he had done anything\" to try to get the story taken down.\n\nDavidson said he eventually sent a cease-and-desist letter to the blog after the dust up with Cohen and the story was removed.\n\nDAVIDSON SAYS HE UNDERSTOOD THE ENQUIRER WOULD NEVER PUBLISH MCDOUGAL'S STORY\n\nLawyer Keith Davidson testified on Tuesday that back-and-forth haggling took place in the selling of former Playboy model Karen McDougal's story to the National Enquirer.\n\nIn one text message shown to jurors, Davidson told Enquirer editor Dylan Howard that \"they are asking me to go back for another 25,\" meaning another $25,000. Howard responds with an expletive, adding, \"Not my money. I'll ask.\"\n\nBut even as they reached a basic framework for the deal, Davidson described his \"growing frustration with the process.\" At one point, Davidson said he was pushed to call Donald Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen directly, something he said he had been trying to avoid.\n\n\"I thought it was odd, certainly,\" Davidson said about being asked to call Cohen. \"I didn't particularly like dealing with him and that's why I was trying like hell to avoid talking to him,\" he added.\n\nDavidson testified that he understood McDougal's story would never be published and acknowledged that \"there was an unspoken understanding that there was an affiliation between David Pecker and Donald Trump and that AMI wouldn't run this story, any story related to Karen, because it would hurt Donald Trump.\"\n\nTRUMP'S ONLINE POSTS FOUND TO VIOLATE GAG ORDER HAVE BEEN REMOVED\n\nDonald Trump's online posts that on Tuesday were found to violate a gag order barring him from speaking publicly about jurors and witnesses in his criminal hush money trial were removed ahead of an afternoon deadline.\n\nThe posts in question were deleted while the court was in recess for lunch.\n\nLinks to the old Truth Social posts redirected to a \"Not found\" message, while those on Trump's website redirected to a 404 error page.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Judge Juan M. Merchan fined the former president $9,000 for the nine posts for violating the order.\n\nTEXAS AG PAXTON AMONG THOSE IN COURTROOM AS TRUMP'S TRIAL RESUMES\n\nCourt in Donald Trump's criminal trial resumed Tuesday after an early afternoon lunch break.\n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton walked into the courtroom with Trump and his entourage after posting on social media earlier in the day that he was there to support the former president. The Republican sat down in the first row of the courtroom gallery directly behind the defense table.\n\nPaxton sat just a few seats away from Trump's son Eric, who sat near the aisle alongside Susie Wiles, a Trump political operative.\n\nKeith Davidson, a lawyer who previously represented former Playboy model Karen McDougal and porn actor Stormy Daniels in hush money negotiations, was expected to returned to the witness stand.\n\nDAVIDSON SHEDS LIGHT ON SEQUENCE OF EVENTS THAT LED TO THE DEAL WITH THE ENQUIRER\n\nKeith Davidson testified Tuesday that after tipping off a National Enquirer editor about \"a blockbuster Trump story,\" he soon arranged a meeting with that editor, former Playboy model Karen McDougal and others to see whether the Enquirer's then-parent company was interested.\n\nAfter flying back to New York, Howard told him the Enquirer wasn't keen \"because Karen McDougal lacked documentary evidence of the interaction,\" Davidson testified.\n\nMcDougal had alleged that she had a year-long affair with Donald Trump years earlier.\n\nA month later, Enquirer editor Dylan Howard reached out again to Davidson, suggesting they resume discussions.\n\nAt the time, Davidson warned that the Enquirer's parent company would need to move quickly, writing in one text: \"Time is of the essence. The girl is being cornered by the estrogen mafia\"\n\nDavidson testified that McDougal was \"teetering\" at the time he sent the message and on the verge of signing a deal to tell her story to ABC News.\n\nDavidson also testified that he played the National Enquirer and ABC News against each other to get the best deal for his client. McDougal didn't want to tell her story publicly, which would've been required if she went to ABC, he said.\n\nJURY SEES TEXTS FROM LAWYER PROMISING TABLOID EDITOR A 'BLOCKBUSTER TRUMP STORY'\n\nIn his court testimony on Tuesday, attorney Keith Davidson described representing Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model, in her allegations of a year-long affair with Donald Trump.\n\nAs questioning turned toward Davidson's involvement in some of the hush money deals at the heart of the former president's criminal trial, he said he met McDougal 25 years ago through a friend. He said he started representing in 2016 \"to provide advice and counsel as to what her rights and obligations would be regarding a personal interaction that she had.\"\n\n\"With whom?\" prosecutor Joshua Steinglass asked.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"Donald Trump.\"\n\nShortly after Davidson began representing McDougal, he said, he reached out to Dylan Howard, the editor in chief of the National Enquirer, promising a \"blockbuster Trump story.\"\n\nHoward replied soon after: \"I will get you more than ANYONE for it. You know why.\"\n\nAs the text messages were displayed on screens to the jury, Davidson testified that he didn't know exactly what Howard meant at the time. But, he noted, \"I knew that Dylan's boss David Pecker and Mr. Trump were longtime friends and had a former business relationship,\" he said, adding the tabloid had effectively \"endorsed Mr. Trump's candidacy.\"\n\nSTORMY DANIELS' FORMER LAWYER CALLED TO THE STAND\n\nA lawyer who previously represented former Playboy model Karen McDougal and porn actor Stormy Daniels was the next witness called to the stand in Donald Trump's hush money trial.\n\nKeith Davidson took the stand shortly after noon Tuesday and is known for representing people trying to sell celebrity sex tapes or other embarrassing information.\n\nHe represented McDougal and Daniels in hush money negotiations with the National Enquirer and Trump's then-lawyer Michael Cohen in 2016.\n\nMcDougal claimed she had had a yearlong affair with Trump in the mid-2000s. Daniels claimed she had a one-time sexual encounter with him in 2006. Trump has denied both allegations.\n\nEXECUTIVE CALLED TO THE STAND TO VERIFY TRANSCRIPT, VIDEO OF TRUMP DEPOSITION\n\nAn executive at a company that provides stenographers and videographers for depositions -- sworn, out-of-court statements under oath -- was the next witness called to the stand in Donald Trump's criminal trial on Tuesday.\n\nPhillip Thompson was called to authenticate a transcript and video of a deposition the former president gave in one of writer E. Jean Carroll's federal defamation lawsuits against him.\n\nThe portions included Carroll's lawyer asking Trump about his Truth Social platform, the dates of his marriage to wife Melania Trump and whether he was aware of the \"Access Hollywood\" tape.\n\nThe former longtime Elle magazine advice columnist had alleged that Trump sexually assaulted her in the 1990s and then defamed her after she came forward publicly in 2019. He has said nothing happened between the two of them and called her a \"wack job\" who engineered a \"hoax\" to sell a book.\n\nAfter two federal trials last year and this winter, juries awarded Carroll over $88 million. Trump is appealing.\n\nVIDEOS OF TRUMP DENYING ALLEGATIONS AND PRAISING COHEN PLAYED IN COURT\n\nProsecutors in Donald Trump's hush money case played C-SPAN clips on Tuesday of the then-presidential candidate on the campaign trail in the final weeks leading up to the 2016 election. In the videos, Trump forcefully denied allegations made by several women after his infamous 2005 \"Access Hollywood\" tape was made public.\n\n\"The stories are total fiction. They're 100% made up, they never happened, they never would happen,\" Trump said in video from an Oct. 14, 2016 rally in North Carolina.\n\nAnother clip played for the jury, from January 2017, showed Trump praising Michael Cohen as as good lawyer and friend.\n\nTrump did not appear to react in court to the clips, which were played on monitors throughout the courtroom, including directly in front of him on the defense table.\n\nAfter confirming the veracity of the clips, Robert Browning -- the executive director of C-SPAN's archives -- was dismissed from the witness stand. Trump's attorneys declined to question him.\n\nEXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF C-SPAN ARCHIVES CALLED TO THE STAND\n\nThe next witness called to the stand Tuesday in Donald Trump's hush money trial was Robert Browning, the executive director of the C-SPAN archives.\n\nBrowning, who manages the network's video collection, was called to verify the authenticity of video of a Trump campaign event.\n\nProsecutors are calling people who are regarded as \"records custodians\" to verify evidence in the former president's criminal case.\n\nTRIAL WILL BREAK FOR 4 DAYS OVER MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND\n\nDonald Trump's hush money trial will get an extra day off for the Memorial Day weekend next month.\n\nCourt won't be in session on Friday, May 24, to accommodate a juror who has a flight that morning, Judge Juan M. Merchan said on Tuesday.\n\nThat means the trial will be off for four straight days for the holiday weekend, resuming on Tuesday, May 28. Merchan also informed jurors there will not be court on May 17, though he didn't give them a reason.\n\nThat's the day Donald Trump will be attending his son Barron's high school graduation.\n\nPROSECUTORS WANT TO QUESTION TRUMP ABOUT GAG ORDER VIOLATIONS IF HE TESTIFIES\n\nAhead of a midday break in Donald Trump's hush money case, prosecutors asked the judge to let them question the former president about his gag order violations should he choose to testify.\n\nThe request came after Judge Juan M. Merchan ruled Tuesday morning that Trump had on nine occasions violated a court mandate barring him from speaking publicly about witnesses and jurors in the case. He ultimately fined Trump $9,000 and will hold another hearing Thursday on four more alleged gag order violations.\n\nProsecutors also requested permission to introduce evidence they said shows Trump orchestrated a \"pressure campaign and intimidation effort\" against Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels.\n\nColangelo said Trump's attorney opened the door to that evidence by seeking to undermine the credibility of the two witnesses in opening statements.\n\nMerchan did not immediately rule, but said, \"the door has been opened.\"\n\nHe previously ruled to allow prosecutors to challenge Trump's credibility by questioning him about a limited number of his recent legal setbacks if he ends up taking the witness stand.\n\nTrump has said he wants to testify, but is under no obligation to do so.\n\nNO RED FLAGS ABOUT COHEN'S ACCOUNTS AT THE TIME, FARRO SAYS\n\nIn his cross examination of banker Gary Farro on Tuesday, defense attorney Todd Blanche underscored that Michael Cohen made no mention that the accounts he opened in October 2016 had anything to do with deals involving then-presidential candidate Donald Trump or his company.\n\nIf Cohen had done so, \"I would have asked questions,\" Farro said.\n\nFarro noted that he might not have opened a bank account for Cohen if he'd been told it was for what's known as a shell corporation -- one that receives and sends out money but doesn't have an underlying business.\n\nBut Cohen, the banker said, told him the account was for a real estate consulting business.\n\nNothing about it raised \"any red flags to you?\" Blanche asked.\n\n\"Not based upon the answers I was given to the questions I asked,\" Farro said.\n\nFarro's testimony shed light on his role in helping Cohen open a bank account that was later used to process a $130,000 wire transfer to a lawyer for Stormy Daniels.\n\nDEFENSE BEGINS CROSS-EXAMINATION OF FARRO\n\nDefense attorneys began their cross-examination of Gary Farro, the prosecution's third witness in Donald Trump's hush money trial, by asking the banker to describe his relationship with Michael Cohen.\n\nFarro said he first met Cohen -- then serving as the former president's personal lawyer -- in person at a meeting in Trump Tower, but primarily communicated over the phone. Pushed by Todd Blanche, Farro acknowledged that Cohen wasn't always easy to work with.\n\n\"He was a challenging client because of his desire to get things done so quickly,\" Farro said. \"Ninety percent of the time it was an urgent matter.\"\n\nPROSECUTORS WRAP QUESTIONING OF FARRO\n\nProsecutors have wrapped up questioning of Gary Farro, their third witness in Donald Trump's criminal hush money trial.\n\nFarro told prosecutors on Tuesday that Michael Cohen had indicated that a 2016 $130,000 wire payment now at the heart of the case was related to a real estate transaction -- not a political candidate, an adult film performer or buying up a potential media story.\n\n\"We might consider something like that a reputational risk,\" Farro said.\n\nWithin a day of opening the Essential Consultants LLC bank account on Oct. 26, 2016 -- and funding it with about $130,000 from his own home equity loan -- Cohen wired out $130,000 to Keith Davidson, then a lawyer for Stormy Daniels, documents showed.\n\nThe 2016 presidential election was on Nov. 8.\n\nFAMILY JOINS TRUMP IN COURT FOR THE FIRST TIME\n\nDonald Trump's son Eric joined his father in court on Tuesday, marking the first time any of the former president's family members have attended his criminal hush money trial.\n\nPrior to court proceedings resuming, Trump turned from the defense table and walked over to his son in the first row of the gallery. Trump put his hand on Eric's arm as they chatted.\n\nTrump had railed about the trial, as well as his other legal cases, to reporters on his way into the courtroom earlier in the morning.\n\nFARRO RETURNS TO THE STAND\n\nTestimony in Donald Trump's hush money trial resumed with Gary Farro, a banker who helped Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen open accounts. Cohen used one such account to buy the silence of porn performer Stormy Daniels in the weeks before the 2016 election. She alleged a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump, which he denies.\n\nCohen indicated the account, opened in late October 2016 in the name of Essential Consultants LLC, would be used for real estate consulting, according to testimony and documents shown at the trial.\n\nIn response to prosecutor Becky Mangold's questions, Farro said the bank would have asked more questions if there had been any mention of a connection to a political candidate, buying a story that was being pitched to the media or paying a porn performer.\n\nThe additional scrutiny would have delayed or even nixed opening the account, which Cohen had wanted to open right away. In particular, the adult film world \"is an industry we don't work with,\" he said.\n\nWith only real estate in the picture, the account was opened within a day -- \"very quick,\" Farro said.\n\nMERCHAN FINDS POST ABOUT COHEN AND DANIELS WAS NOT A VIOLATION\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan found that one of Donald Trump's online posts about his former lawyer Michael Cohen and porn actor Stormy Daniels did not violate a gag order barring him from speaking publicly about jurors and witnesses in his hush money case.\n\nMerchan wrote that he was finding Trump \"in criminal contempt for willfully disobeying a lawful mandate\" of the court on nine separate occasions for posts made on Truth Social and his campaign website.\n\nMerchan ruled that Trump's April 10 post referring to Cohen and Daniels as \"sleaze bags\" was not a gag order violation. He said Trump's contention that he was responding to previous posts by Cohen \"is sufficient to give\" him pause \"as to whether the People have met their burden\" as to that post.\n\nHowever, the other nine \"attack the credibility of arguably two of the more high-profile witnesses in this case.\"\n\n\"To allow such attacks upon protected witnesses with blanket assertions that they are all responses to 'political attacks' would be an exception that swallowed the rule. The Expanded Order does not contain such an exception,\" Merchan wrote.\n\nJUDGE FINDS TRUMP VIOLATED GAG ORDER, FINES HIM $9K\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan ruled Tuesday morning that Donald Trump violated a gag order barring him from making public statements about witnesses and jurors in his hush money trial nine times. He fined the former president $9,000 for the violations.\n\nProsecutors had alleged the former president had violated the order 10 times, and Merchan concurred in all but one of those instances. The judge will hold a hearing Thursday on four more alleged violations.\n\nThe former president stared down at the table in front of him as Merchan read the ruling, frowning slightly but otherwise showing no expression.\n\nMerchan wrote in his ruling that Trump \"is hereby warned that the Court will not tolerate continued willful violations of its lawful orders\" and raised the possibility of jail time if \"necessary and appropriate under the circumstances.\"\n\nJUDGE TO ALLOW TRUMP TO ATTEND SON'S GRADUATION\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan said Tuesday morning that Donald Trump's criminal hush money trial will not be held on May 17 so that the former president can attend his son's graduation.\n\n\"I don't think the May 17 date is a problem, so Mr. Trump can certainly attend that date, attend his son's graduation,\" Merchan said.\n\nTrump had previously requested the day off from court to accommodate his son Barron's high school graduation.\n\nTRUMP ARRIVES AT COURT\n\nDonald Trump's motorcade arrived Tuesday morning at the courthouse in lower Manhattan just before 9 a.m., kicking off the second week of witness testimony in the former president's hush money trial.\n\nA crowd of around 60 Trump supporters had gathered across the street from the building, waving Trump and American flags on tall poles.\n\nTRUMP LEAVES TRUMP TOWER FOR COURT\n\nDonald Trump entered his motorcade outside Trump Tower in midtown, headed to the courthouse in lower Manhattan for the second week of trial testimony.\n\nThe former president on Tuesday will be in court for testimony from the third prosecution witness, Gary Farro, a banker who helped Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen open accounts.\n\nCohen used one to buy the silence of porn performer Stormy Daniels. She alleged a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump, which he denies.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

His status as a former professional athlete gives him instant credibility.\n\nPeople are also reading...

And the headlines grabbed by Miller's decision to take over as the acting football coach could help the team with recruitment.\n\n\"I think the attention that it's bringing is going to be valuable for the program,\" said junior Logan Henyon, an offensive and defensive lineman in the program. \"We always need guys to come play for us. Having that excitement of a coach you know brings that energy and hopefully some interest in the program.\"\n\nDuring an interview earlier this month, shortly after the school announced Miller's hiring to fill the opening created when former coach Joe Sandoe resigned to take a job in Atlanta, Miller said he had a long summer to-do list as he gets up to speed for his new gig.\n\nAtop that list is determining what his coaching staff will look like, who from the previous staff is still interested in coaching the team and what positions he might need to fill.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | Omny Studio\n\nThat process will inform what type of schemes and systems Miller will make the hallmark of his program.\n\n\"This is a huge undertaking for me,\" said Miller, who didn't rule out staying on the job beyond one season. \"So, I'm going to work to find guys who maybe know more about coaching, who've been in it longer than I have and surround myself with the best coaches to not only help me out, but for the kids.\"\n\nWith most of the football team's players currently playing spring sports, Miller's work with them won't really kick into high gear until August. Once he has his staff in place, Miller said he'd be getting his players a summer workout plan.\n\nMiller knows he'll want the team to have an identity based on what it does well and believes the better understanding players have of their assignments and responsibilities, the more freely and more effectively they can play.\n\n\"Even in the NFL, you've got to have some things as a coach that you hang your hat on, that your team does really well and they know how to execute,\" Miller said. \"If you can get your players to not think on the field and play full speed, I think you're going to have better results. We move faster when we're just reacting and playing off our instincts.\"\n\nMiller, a Swords Creek, Virginia, native who spent his high school years at Honaker, played for Groh at Virginia from 2001-2004, helping the team to three straight bowl appearances and earning unanimous All-America honors at as a junior. That season, he won the Mackey Award, given to the nation's top tight end, ending his career as the ACC career record-holder for catches, receiving yards and touchdown receptions by a tight end.\n\nPittsburgh selected him in the first round of the 2005 NFL Draft and Miller went on to play 11 seasons for the Steelers, catching 592 passes for 6,569 yards and 45 touchdowns in 168 games. He was named to the Pro Bowl in 2009 and 2012.\n\nMiller learned a lot of football from Groh, who went 59-54 in nine years at UVa, Cowher, a Pro Football Hall of Famer who won a Super Bowl with Pittsburgh, and Tomlin, the William & Mary graduate who succeeded Cowher and has coached the Steelers the past 17 years, winning a championship as well.\n\nBut Miller said it's some of the life lessons those coaches imparted to him that will influence his work with the players at STAB even more than x's and o's.\n\n\"I had Coach Groh at the University of Virginia at such an impressionable age,\" Miller said. \"The things I learned from him, the things he taught me to approach the game of football, are also so applicable to being a good father, to being a good human in everyday life. That goes the same for Coach Cowher and Coach Tomlin. So, I'm sure everything I say and do will be because of those guys.\"\n\nMike Barber (804) 649-6546\n\nmbarber@timesdispatch.com\n\nTags Heath Miller Honaker Virginia Charlottesville Joe Sandoe Mike Tomlin Sports American Football Job Market School Systems Armed Forces Games And Toys Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.",

Merchan of bias and of rushing the case, and also saying he should be out campaigning.\n\nTrump was found in contempt of court earlier in the day and fined $9,000 for nine violations of the gag order, which bars him from speaking publicly about witnesses and jurors in the case.\n\nDAVIDSON SAYS HE THOUGHT DANIELS' STORY WOULD 'BE A TORNADO' IF IT GOT OUT\n\nKeith Davidson and Dylan Howard, then-editor of the National Enquirer, texted each other about what Howard called an \"impending storm\" of publicity if Stormy Daniels took her story elsewhere after Michael Cohen failed to make a payment in the deal on time, according to Davidson's testimony and documents shown at the trial on Tuesday.\n\nDavidson wrote to Howard that he believed Daniels and her agent had agreed to bring her story about a sexual encounter with Donald Trump to another publication, and \"I think it'll be a full-on blitz.\"\n\n\"I just felt like there was going to be more than a flurry of activity. I felt like it was going to be a tornado,\" Davidson explained in court.\n\n\"If the story got out,\" Steinglass asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Davidson said.\n\nAsked if Cohen ever told him who he was representing in the Daniels negotiations, Davidson said that he may not have explicitly stated he was working on Trump's behalf -- but the implication was clear.\n\nCOHEN MISSED DEADLINE TO PAY $130K TO STORMY DANIELS, DAVIDSON SAYS\n\nBefore a brief afternoon break in Donald Trump's hush money trial, lawyer Keith Davidson testified Tuesday that Michael Cohen missed an agreed upon deadline for sending a $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels.\n\nAt first, Cohen offered a litany of explanations for the delay, at turns blaming broken computers, Secret Service \"firewalls,\" and the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur. \"The things he was saying didn't really make sense,\" Davidson said of Cohen.\n\nAs the excuses piled up, Davidson said he understood that Cohen \"didn't have the authority to actually spend money.\" He eventually sent an email informing Cohen that the deal involving Daniel's story about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump was off.\n\n\"I thought he was trying to kick the can down the round until after the election,\" Davidson said.\n\nAPPELLATE COURT REJECTS TRUMP'S REQUEST TO STAY HUSH MONEY TRIAL\n\nAs testimony continued in Donald Trump's hush money trial on Tuesday, a five-judge panel in New York state's mid-level appellate court rejected the former president's request for a stay of the proceedings while he appeals several pretrial rulings, including the trial judge's refusal to recuse himself.\n\nTrump had sought the stay prior to the start of jury selection. A lone judge in the appeals court had previously rejected a request for an emergency stay halting the trial.\n\nPSEUDONYMS WERE USED TO DISGUISE PARTIES INVOLVED IN ENQUIRER DEAL, LAWYER TESTIFIES\n\nIn drawing up the deal with the National Enquirer involving Stormy Daniels' story about an alleged sexual encounter with Donald Trump, Keith Davidson testified Tuesday that he used pseudonyms to disguise the parties involved.\n\nStormy Daniels became Peggy Peterson and Donald Trump became David Dennison, according to Davidson.\n\nThe alliterative code names were picked, in part, because Daniels was the plaintiff and Trump was the defendant, the lawyer testified.\n\nAsked by prosecutors in Trump's hush money case if David Dennison was a real person, Davidson said that he played on his high school hockey team.\n\n\"And how does he feel about you now?\" asked prosecutor Josh Steinglass.\n\nDavidson stifled a laugh, then answered: \"He's very upset.\"\n\n'MICHAEL COHEN STEPPED INTO AMI'S SHOES,' DAVIDSON SAYS\n\nStormy Daniels' agent reached a six-figure deal with then-National Enquirer editor Dylan Howard for the tabloid to acquire the rights to her story about a sexual encounter with Donald Trump after his \"Access Hollywood\" tape leaked, Keith Davidson testified Tuesday.\n\nBut then, according to Davidson, Howard backed out.\n\nThe editor instead told Daniels' agent, Gina Rodriguez, to call Michael Cohen and complete the deal directly with him -- but she refused to speak with Cohen after an uncomfortable prior interaction.\n\nRodriguez asked Davidson to step in and negotiate the deal with Cohen, the lawyer testified.\n\nDavidson added that he had numerous interactions with Howard over the years regarding stories. Asked if it was unusual for Howard to direct him to make a deal with a third party like Cohen, Davidson responded: \"This is the only time that ever happened.\"\n\n\"In essence, Michael Cohen stepped into AMI's shoes,\" Davidson said, referring to the name of the Enquirer's parent company at the time, American Media Inc.\n\nDavidson testified that in negotiating with Cohen, he hiked the price to $130,000 -- building in his fee for his work on the deal.\n\n'ACCESS HOLLYWOOD' TAPE LEAK MADE DANIELS' STORY MORE MARKETABLE, LAWYER SAYS\n\nStormy Daniels' story about a sexual encounter with Donald Trump became more marketable after the notorious \"Access Hollywood\" tape was leaked, Keith Davidson testified on Tuesday.\n\nDavidson, who previously represented Daniels, told prosecutors that Daniels' agent, Gina Rodriguez, had been trying to drum up interest in her story earlier in the 2016 election cycle but found there wasn't much.\n\nAsked to describe the \"Access Hollywood\" tape, which can't be shown in court, Davidson testified that it involved Trump and the show's then-host Billy Bush being recorded on a \"hot mic\" and \"some statements by both men that were troublesome.\"\n\n'HE WAS JUST SCREAMING,' LAWYER TESTIFIES OF FIRST INTERACTION WITH COHEN\n\nKeith Davidson on Tuesday testified that his first interaction with Michael Cohen related to a 2011 post on a gossip blog that stated that porn actor Stormy Daniels and Trump had \"some sort of physical or romantic interaction.\"\n\nAfter the blog post was published, Davidson said, Daniels' agent Gina Rodriguez called him and said, \"some jerk called me and was very, very aggressive and threatened to sue me.\"\n\nAsked who the \"jerk\" was, Davidson said: \"Michael Cohen.\"\n\nDavidson testified that when he called Cohen, the ex-Trump lawyer greeted him \"with a hostile barrage of insults and insinuations that went on for quite a while.\"\n\n\"I don't think he was accusing us of anything, he was just screaming,\" Davidson continued. \"Finally, after he finished, I explained to him that I was calling because my client, Stormy Daniels, did not want the story up. I wanted to see if he had done anything\" to try to get the story taken down.\n\nDavidson said he eventually sent a cease-and-desist letter to the blog after the dust up with Cohen and the story was removed.\n\nDAVIDSON SAYS HE UNDERSTOOD THE ENQUIRER WOULD NEVER PUBLISH MCDOUGAL'S STORY\n\nLawyer Keith Davidson testified on Tuesday that back-and-forth haggling took place in the selling of former Playboy model Karen McDougal's story to the National Enquirer.\n\nIn one text message shown to jurors, Davidson told Enquirer editor Dylan Howard that \"they are asking me to go back for another 25,\" meaning another $25,000. Howard responds with an expletive, adding, \"Not my money. I'll ask.\"\n\nBut even as they reached a basic framework for the deal, Davidson described his \"growing frustration with the process.\" At one point, Davidson said he was pushed to call Donald Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen directly, something he said he had been trying to avoid.\n\n\"I thought it was odd, certainly,\" Davidson said about being asked to call Cohen. \"I didn't particularly like dealing with him and that's why I was trying like hell to avoid talking to him,\" he added.\n\nDavidson testified that he understood McDougal's story would never be published and acknowledged that \"there was an unspoken understanding that there was an affiliation between David Pecker and Donald Trump and that AMI wouldn't run this story, any story related to Karen, because it would hurt Donald Trump.\"\n\nTRUMP'S ONLINE POSTS FOUND TO VIOLATE GAG ORDER HAVE BEEN REMOVED\n\nDonald Trump's online posts that on Tuesday were found to violate a gag order barring him from speaking publicly about jurors and witnesses in his criminal hush money trial were removed ahead of an afternoon deadline.\n\nThe posts in question were deleted while the court was in recess for lunch.\n\nLinks to the old Truth Social posts redirected to a \"Not found\" message, while those on Trump's website redirected to a 404 error page.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Judge Juan M. Merchan fined the former president $9,000 for the nine posts for violating the order.\n\nTEXAS AG PAXTON AMONG THOSE IN COURTROOM AS TRUMP'S TRIAL RESUMES\n\nCourt in Donald Trump's criminal trial resumed Tuesday after an early afternoon lunch break.\n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton walked into the courtroom with Trump and his entourage after posting on social media earlier in the day that he was there to support the former president. The Republican sat down in the first row of the courtroom gallery directly behind the defense table.\n\nPaxton sat just a few seats away from Trump's son Eric, who sat near the aisle alongside Susie Wiles, a Trump political operative.\n\nKeith Davidson, a lawyer who previously represented former Playboy model Karen McDougal and porn actor Stormy Daniels in hush money negotiations, was expected to returned to the witness stand.\n\nDAVIDSON SHEDS LIGHT ON SEQUENCE OF EVENTS THAT LED TO THE DEAL WITH THE ENQUIRER\n\nKeith Davidson testified Tuesday that after tipping off a National Enquirer editor about \"a blockbuster Trump story,\" he soon arranged a meeting with that editor, former Playboy model Karen McDougal and others to see whether the Enquirer's then-parent company was interested.\n\nAfter flying back to New York, Howard told him the Enquirer wasn't keen \"because Karen McDougal lacked documentary evidence of the interaction,\" Davidson testified.\n\nMcDougal had alleged that she had a year-long affair with Donald Trump years earlier.\n\nA month later, Enquirer editor Dylan Howard reached out again to Davidson, suggesting they resume discussions.\n\nAt the time, Davidson warned that the Enquirer's parent company would need to move quickly, writing in one text: \"Time is of the essence. The girl is being cornered by the estrogen mafia\"\n\nDavidson testified that McDougal was \"teetering\" at the time he sent the message and on the verge of signing a deal to tell her story to ABC News.\n\nDavidson also testified that he played the National Enquirer and ABC News against each other to get the best deal for his client. McDougal didn't want to tell her story publicly, which would've been required if she went to ABC, he said.\n\nJURY SEES TEXTS FROM LAWYER PROMISING TABLOID EDITOR A 'BLOCKBUSTER TRUMP STORY'\n\nIn his court testimony on Tuesday, attorney Keith Davidson described representing Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model, in her allegations of a year-long affair with Donald Trump.\n\nAs questioning turned toward Davidson's involvement in some of the hush money deals at the heart of the former president's criminal trial, he said he met McDougal 25 years ago through a friend. He said he started representing in 2016 \"to provide advice and counsel as to what her rights and obligations would be regarding a personal interaction that she had.\"\n\n\"With whom?\" prosecutor Joshua Steinglass asked.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"Donald Trump.\"\n\nShortly after Davidson began representing McDougal, he said, he reached out to Dylan Howard, the editor in chief of the National Enquirer, promising a \"blockbuster Trump story.\"\n\nHoward replied soon after: \"I will get you more than ANYONE for it. You know why.\"\n\nAs the text messages were displayed on screens to the jury, Davidson testified that he didn't know exactly what Howard meant at the time. But, he noted, \"I knew that Dylan's boss David Pecker and Mr. Trump were longtime friends and had a former business relationship,\" he said, adding the tabloid had effectively \"endorsed Mr. Trump's candidacy.\"\n\nSTORMY DANIELS' FORMER LAWYER CALLED TO THE STAND\n\nA lawyer who previously represented former Playboy model Karen McDougal and porn actor Stormy Daniels was the next witness called to the stand in Donald Trump's hush money trial.\n\nKeith Davidson took the stand shortly after noon Tuesday and is known for representing people trying to sell celebrity sex tapes or other embarrassing information.\n\nHe represented McDougal and Daniels in hush money negotiations with the National Enquirer and Trump's then-lawyer Michael Cohen in 2016.\n\nMcDougal claimed she had had a yearlong affair with Trump in the mid-2000s. Daniels claimed she had a one-time sexual encounter with him in 2006. Trump has denied both allegations.\n\nEXECUTIVE CALLED TO THE STAND TO VERIFY TRANSCRIPT, VIDEO OF TRUMP DEPOSITION\n\nAn executive at a company that provides stenographers and videographers for depositions -- sworn, out-of-court statements under oath -- was the next witness called to the stand in Donald Trump's criminal trial on Tuesday.\n\nPhillip Thompson was called to authenticate a transcript and video of a deposition the former president gave in one of writer E. Jean Carroll's federal defamation lawsuits against him.\n\nThe portions included Carroll's lawyer asking Trump about his Truth Social platform, the dates of his marriage to wife Melania Trump and whether he was aware of the \"Access Hollywood\" tape.\n\nThe former longtime Elle magazine advice columnist had alleged that Trump sexually assaulted her in the 1990s and then defamed her after she came forward publicly in 2019. He has said nothing happened between the two of them and called her a \"wack job\" who engineered a \"hoax\" to sell a book.\n\nAfter two federal trials last year and this winter, juries awarded Carroll over $88 million. Trump is appealing.\n\nVIDEOS OF TRUMP DENYING ALLEGATIONS AND PRAISING COHEN PLAYED IN COURT\n\nProsecutors in Donald Trump's hush money case played C-SPAN clips on Tuesday of the then-presidential candidate on the campaign trail in the final weeks leading up to the 2016 election. In the videos, Trump forcefully denied allegations made by several women after his infamous 2005 \"Access Hollywood\" tape was made public.\n\n\"The stories are total fiction. They're 100% made up, they never happened, they never would happen,\" Trump said in video from an Oct. 14, 2016 rally in North Carolina.\n\nAnother clip played for the jury, from January 2017, showed Trump praising Michael Cohen as as good lawyer and friend.\n\nTrump did not appear to react in court to the clips, which were played on monitors throughout the courtroom, including directly in front of him on the defense table.\n\nAfter confirming the veracity of the clips, Robert Browning -- the executive director of C-SPAN's archives -- was dismissed from the witness stand. Trump's attorneys declined to question him.\n\nEXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF C-SPAN ARCHIVES CALLED TO THE STAND\n\nThe next witness called to the stand Tuesday in Donald Trump's hush money trial was Robert Browning, the executive director of the C-SPAN archives.\n\nBrowning, who manages the network's video collection, was called to verify the authenticity of video of a Trump campaign event.\n\nProsecutors are calling people who are regarded as \"records custodians\" to verify evidence in the former president's criminal case.\n\nTRIAL WILL BREAK FOR 4 DAYS OVER MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND\n\nDonald Trump's hush money trial will get an extra day off for the Memorial Day weekend next month.\n\nCourt won't be in session on Friday, May 24, to accommodate a juror who has a flight that morning, Judge Juan M. Merchan said on Tuesday.\n\nThat means the trial will be off for four straight days for the holiday weekend, resuming on Tuesday, May 28. Merchan also informed jurors there will not be court on May 17, though he didn't give them a reason.\n\nThat's the day Donald Trump will be attending his son Barron's high school graduation.\n\nPROSECUTORS WANT TO QUESTION TRUMP ABOUT GAG ORDER VIOLATIONS IF HE TESTIFIES\n\nAhead of a midday break in Donald Trump's hush money case, prosecutors asked the judge to let them question the former president about his gag order violations should he choose to testify.\n\nThe request came after Judge Juan M. Merchan ruled Tuesday morning that Trump had on nine occasions violated a court mandate barring him from speaking publicly about witnesses and jurors in the case. He ultimately fined Trump $9,000 and will hold another hearing Thursday on four more alleged gag order violations.\n\nProsecutors also requested permission to introduce evidence they said shows Trump orchestrated a \"pressure campaign and intimidation effort\" against Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels.\n\nColangelo said Trump's attorney opened the door to that evidence by seeking to undermine the credibility of the two witnesses in opening statements.\n\nMerchan did not immediately rule, but said, \"the door has been opened.\"\n\nHe previously ruled to allow prosecutors to challenge Trump's credibility by questioning him about a limited number of his recent legal setbacks if he ends up taking the witness stand.\n\nTrump has said he wants to testify, but is under no obligation to do so.\n\nNO RED FLAGS ABOUT COHEN'S ACCOUNTS AT THE TIME, FARRO SAYS\n\nIn his cross examination of banker Gary Farro on Tuesday, defense attorney Todd Blanche underscored that Michael Cohen made no mention that the accounts he opened in October 2016 had anything to do with deals involving then-presidential candidate Donald Trump or his company.\n\nIf Cohen had done so, \"I would have asked questions,\" Farro said.\n\nFarro noted that he might not have opened a bank account for Cohen if he'd been told it was for what's known as a shell corporation -- one that receives and sends out money but doesn't have an underlying business.\n\nBut Cohen, the banker said, told him the account was for a real estate consulting business.\n\nNothing about it raised \"any red flags to you?\" Blanche asked.\n\n\"Not based upon the answers I was given to the questions I asked,\" Farro said.\n\nFarro's testimony shed light on his role in helping Cohen open a bank account that was later used to process a $130,000 wire transfer to a lawyer for Stormy Daniels.\n\nDEFENSE BEGINS CROSS-EXAMINATION OF FARRO\n\nDefense attorneys began their cross-examination of Gary Farro, the prosecution's third witness in Donald Trump's hush money trial, by asking the banker to describe his relationship with Michael Cohen.\n\nFarro said he first met Cohen -- then serving as the former president's personal lawyer -- in person at a meeting in Trump Tower, but primarily communicated over the phone. Pushed by Todd Blanche, Farro acknowledged that Cohen wasn't always easy to work with.\n\n\"He was a challenging client because of his desire to get things done so quickly,\" Farro said. \"Ninety percent of the time it was an urgent matter.\"\n\nPROSECUTORS WRAP QUESTIONING OF FARRO\n\nProsecutors have wrapped up questioning of Gary Farro, their third witness in Donald Trump's criminal hush money trial.\n\nFarro told prosecutors on Tuesday that Michael Cohen had indicated that a 2016 $130,000 wire payment now at the heart of the case was related to a real estate transaction -- not a political candidate, an adult film performer or buying up a potential media story.\n\n\"We might consider something like that a reputational risk,\" Farro said.\n\nWithin a day of opening the Essential Consultants LLC bank account on Oct. 26, 2016 -- and funding it with about $130,000 from his own home equity loan -- Cohen wired out $130,000 to Keith Davidson, then a lawyer for Stormy Daniels, documents showed.\n\nThe 2016 presidential election was on Nov. 8.\n\nFAMILY JOINS TRUMP IN COURT FOR THE FIRST TIME\n\nDonald Trump's son Eric joined his father in court on Tuesday, marking the first time any of the former president's family members have attended his criminal hush money trial.\n\nPrior to court proceedings resuming, Trump turned from the defense table and walked over to his son in the first row of the gallery. Trump put his hand on Eric's arm as they chatted.\n\nTrump had railed about the trial, as well as his other legal cases, to reporters on his way into the courtroom earlier in the morning.\n\nFARRO RETURNS TO THE STAND\n\nTestimony in Donald Trump's hush money trial resumed with Gary Farro, a banker who helped Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen open accounts. Cohen used one such account to buy the silence of porn performer Stormy Daniels in the weeks before the 2016 election. She alleged a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump, which he denies.\n\nCohen indicated the account, opened in late October 2016 in the name of Essential Consultants LLC, would be used for real estate consulting, according to testimony and documents shown at the trial.\n\nIn response to prosecutor Becky Mangold's questions, Farro said the bank would have asked more questions if there had been any mention of a connection to a political candidate, buying a story that was being pitched to the media or paying a porn performer.\n\nThe additional scrutiny would have delayed or even nixed opening the account, which Cohen had wanted to open right away. In particular, the adult film world \"is an industry we don't work with,\" he said.\n\nWith only real estate in the picture, the account was opened within a day -- \"very quick,\" Farro said.\n\nMERCHAN FINDS POST ABOUT COHEN AND DANIELS WAS NOT A VIOLATION\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan found that one of Donald Trump's online posts about his former lawyer Michael Cohen and porn actor Stormy Daniels did not violate a gag order barring him from speaking publicly about jurors and witnesses in his hush money case.\n\nMerchan wrote that he was finding Trump \"in criminal contempt for willfully disobeying a lawful mandate\" of the court on nine separate occasions for posts made on Truth Social and his campaign website.\n\nMerchan ruled that Trump's April 10 post referring to Cohen and Daniels as \"sleaze bags\" was not a gag order violation. He said Trump's contention that he was responding to previous posts by Cohen \"is sufficient to give\" him pause \"as to whether the People have met their burden\" as to that post.\n\nHowever, the other nine \"attack the credibility of arguably two of the more high-profile witnesses in this case.\"\n\n\"To allow such attacks upon protected witnesses with blanket assertions that they are all responses to 'political attacks' would be an exception that swallowed the rule. The Expanded Order does not contain such an exception,\" Merchan wrote.\n\nJUDGE FINDS TRUMP VIOLATED GAG ORDER, FINES HIM $9K\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan ruled Tuesday morning that Donald Trump violated a gag order barring him from making public statements about witnesses and jurors in his hush money trial nine times. He fined the former president $9,000 for the violations.\n\nProsecutors had alleged the former president had violated the order 10 times, and Merchan concurred in all but one of those instances. The judge will hold a hearing Thursday on four more alleged violations.\n\nThe former president stared down at the table in front of him as Merchan read the ruling, frowning slightly but otherwise showing no expression.\n\nMerchan wrote in his ruling that Trump \"is hereby warned that the Court will not tolerate continued willful violations of its lawful orders\" and raised the possibility of jail time if \"necessary and appropriate under the circumstances.\"\n\nJUDGE TO ALLOW TRUMP TO ATTEND SON'S GRADUATION\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan said Tuesday morning that Donald Trump's criminal hush money trial will not be held on May 17 so that the former president can attend his son's graduation.\n\n\"I don't think the May 17 date is a problem, so Mr. Trump can certainly attend that date, attend his son's graduation,\" Merchan said.\n\nTrump had previously requested the day off from court to accommodate his son Barron's high school graduation.\n\nTRUMP ARRIVES AT COURT\n\nDonald Trump's motorcade arrived Tuesday morning at the courthouse in lower Manhattan just before 9 a.m., kicking off the second week of witness testimony in the former president's hush money trial.\n\nA crowd of around 60 Trump supporters had gathered across the street from the building, waving Trump and American flags on tall poles.\n\nTRUMP LEAVES TRUMP TOWER FOR COURT\n\nDonald Trump entered his motorcade outside Trump Tower in midtown, headed to the courthouse in lower Manhattan for the second week of trial testimony.\n\nThe former president on Tuesday will be in court for testimony from the third prosecution witness, Gary Farro, a banker who helped Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen open accounts.\n\nCohen used one to buy the silence of porn performer Stormy Daniels. She alleged a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump, which he denies.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

        "text": "AP\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Witness testimony in Donald Trump's criminal trial advanced on Tuesday with three people taking the stand, including Keith Davidson, a lawyer who previously represented Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal in hush money negotiations involving the former president.\n\nDavidson's testimony dominated the afternoon, highlighting his interactions with Trump's ex-lawyer Michael Cohen and detailing the lead-up to a deal that ultimately came with a $130,000 payment to Daniels.\n\nTuesday's proceedings, however, kicked off with the judge holding Trump in contempt and fining him $9,000 over nine online posts that he found violated a gag order barring the former president from speaking publicly about jurors and witnesses in the case.\n\nMerchan warned that if Trump does it again, he could be jailed.\n\nPeople are also reading...

I felt like it was going to be a tornado,\" Davidson explained in court.\n\n\"If the story got out,\" Steinglass asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Davidson said.\n\nAsked if Cohen ever told him who he was representing in the Daniels negotiations, Davidson said that he may not have explicitly stated he was working on Trump's behalf -- but the implication was clear.\n\nCOHEN MISSED DEADLINE TO PAY $130K TO STORMY DANIELS, DAVIDSON SAYS\n\nBefore a brief afternoon break in Donald Trump's hush money trial, lawyer Keith Davidson testified Tuesday that Michael Cohen missed an agreed upon deadline for sending a $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels.\n\nAt first, Cohen offered a litany of explanations for the delay, at turns blaming broken computers, Secret Service \"firewalls,\" and the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur. \"The things he was saying didn't really make sense,\" Davidson said of Cohen.\n\nAs the excuses piled up, Davidson said he understood that Cohen \"didn't have the authority to actually spend money.\" He eventually sent an email informing Cohen that the deal involving Daniel's story about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump was off.\n\n\"I thought he was trying to kick the can down the round until after the election,\" Davidson said.\n\nAPPELLATE COURT REJECTS TRUMP'S REQUEST TO STAY HUSH MONEY TRIAL\n\nAs testimony continued in Donald Trump's hush money trial on Tuesday, a five-judge panel in New York state's mid-level appellate court rejected the former president's request for a stay of the proceedings while he appeals several pretrial rulings, including the trial judge's refusal to recuse himself.\n\nTrump had sought the stay prior to the start of jury selection. A lone judge in the appeals court had previously rejected a request for an emergency stay halting the trial.\n\nPSEUDONYMS WERE USED TO DISGUISE PARTIES INVOLVED IN ENQUIRER DEAL, LAWYER TESTIFIES\n\nIn drawing up the deal with the National Enquirer involving Stormy Daniels' story about an alleged sexual encounter with Donald Trump, Keith Davidson testified Tuesday that he used pseudonyms to disguise the parties involved.\n\nStormy Daniels became Peggy Peterson and Donald Trump became David Dennison, according to Davidson.\n\nThe alliterative code names were picked, in part, because Daniels was the plaintiff and Trump was the defendant, the lawyer testified.\n\nAsked by prosecutors in Trump's hush money case if David Dennison was a real person, Davidson said that he played on his high school hockey team.\n\n\"And how does he feel about you now?\" asked prosecutor Josh Steinglass.\n\nDavidson stifled a laugh, then answered: \"He's very upset.\"\n\n'MICHAEL COHEN STEPPED INTO AMI'S SHOES,' DAVIDSON SAYS\n\nStormy Daniels' agent reached a six-figure deal with then-National Enquirer editor Dylan Howard for the tabloid to acquire the rights to her story about a sexual encounter with Donald Trump after his \"Access Hollywood\" tape leaked, Keith Davidson testified Tuesday.\n\nBut then, according to Davidson, Howard backed out.\n\nThe editor instead told Daniels' agent, Gina Rodriguez, to call Michael Cohen and complete the deal directly with him -- but she refused to speak with Cohen after an uncomfortable prior interaction.\n\nRodriguez asked Davidson to step in and negotiate the deal with Cohen, the lawyer testified.\n\nDavidson added that he had numerous interactions with Howard over the years regarding stories. Asked if it was unusual for Howard to direct him to make a deal with a third party like Cohen, Davidson responded: \"This is the only time that ever happened.\"\n\n\"In essence, Michael Cohen stepped into AMI's shoes,\" Davidson said, referring to the name of the Enquirer's parent company at the time, American Media Inc.\n\nDavidson testified that in negotiating with Cohen, he hiked the price to $130,000 -- building in his fee for his work on the deal.\n\n'ACCESS HOLLYWOOD' TAPE LEAK MADE DANIELS' STORY MORE MARKETABLE, LAWYER SAYS\n\nStormy Daniels' story about a sexual encounter with Donald Trump became more marketable after the notorious \"Access Hollywood\" tape was leaked, Keith Davidson testified on Tuesday.\n\nDavidson, who previously represented Daniels, told prosecutors that Daniels' agent, Gina Rodriguez, had been trying to drum up interest in her story earlier in the 2016 election cycle but found there wasn't much.\n\nAsked to describe the \"Access Hollywood\" tape, which can't be shown in court, Davidson testified that it involved Trump and the show's then-host Billy Bush being recorded on a \"hot mic\" and \"some statements by both men that were troublesome.\"\n\n'HE WAS JUST SCREAMING,' LAWYER TESTIFIES OF FIRST INTERACTION WITH COHEN\n\nKeith Davidson on Tuesday testified that his first interaction with Michael Cohen related to a 2011 post on a gossip blog that stated that porn actor Stormy Daniels and Trump had \"some sort of physical or romantic interaction.\"\n\nAfter the blog post was published, Davidson said, Daniels' agent Gina Rodriguez called him and said, \"some jerk called me and was very, very aggressive and threatened to sue me.\"\n\nAsked who the \"jerk\" was, Davidson said: \"Michael Cohen.\"\n\nDavidson testified that when he called Cohen, the ex-Trump lawyer greeted him \"with a hostile barrage of insults and insinuations that went on for quite a while.\"\n\n\"I don't think he was accusing us of anything, he was just screaming,\" Davidson continued. \"Finally, after he finished, I explained to him that I was calling because my client, Stormy Daniels, did not want the story up. I wanted to see if he had done anything\" to try to get the story taken down.\n\nDavidson said he eventually sent a cease-and-desist letter to the blog after the dust up with Cohen and the story was removed.\n\nDAVIDSON SAYS HE UNDERSTOOD THE ENQUIRER WOULD NEVER PUBLISH MCDOUGAL'S STORY\n\nLawyer Keith Davidson testified on Tuesday that back-and-forth haggling took place in the selling of former Playboy model Karen McDougal's story to the National Enquirer.\n\nIn one text message shown to jurors, Davidson told Enquirer editor Dylan Howard that \"they are asking me to go back for another 25,\" meaning another $25,000. Howard responds with an expletive, adding, \"Not my money. I'll ask.\"\n\nBut even as they reached a basic framework for the deal, Davidson described his \"growing frustration with the process.\" At one point, Davidson said he was pushed to call Donald Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen directly, something he said he had been trying to avoid.\n\n\"I thought it was odd, certainly,\" Davidson said about being asked to call Cohen. \"I didn't particularly like dealing with him and that's why I was trying like hell to avoid talking to him,\" he added.\n\nDavidson testified that he understood McDougal's story would never be published and acknowledged that \"there was an unspoken understanding that there was an affiliation between David Pecker and Donald Trump and that AMI wouldn't run this story, any story related to Karen, because it would hurt Donald Trump.\"\n\nTRUMP'S ONLINE POSTS FOUND TO VIOLATE GAG ORDER HAVE BEEN REMOVED\n\nDonald Trump's online posts that on Tuesday were found to violate a gag order barring him from speaking publicly about jurors and witnesses in his criminal hush money trial were removed ahead of an afternoon deadline.\n\nThe posts in question were deleted while the court was in recess for lunch.\n\nLinks to the old Truth Social posts redirected to a \"Not found\" message, while those on Trump's website redirected to a 404 error page.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Judge Juan M. Merchan fined the former president $9,000 for the nine posts for violating the order.\n\nTEXAS AG PAXTON AMONG THOSE IN COURTROOM AS TRUMP'S TRIAL RESUMES\n\nCourt in Donald Trump's criminal trial resumed Tuesday after an early afternoon lunch break.\n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton walked into the courtroom with Trump and his entourage after posting on social media earlier in the day that he was there to support the former president. The Republican sat down in the first row of the courtroom gallery directly behind the defense table.\n\nPaxton sat just a few seats away from Trump's son Eric, who sat near the aisle alongside Susie Wiles, a Trump political operative.\n\nKeith Davidson, a lawyer who previously represented former Playboy model Karen McDougal and porn actor Stormy Daniels in hush money negotiations, was expected to returned to the witness stand.\n\nDAVIDSON SHEDS LIGHT ON SEQUENCE OF EVENTS THAT LED TO THE DEAL WITH THE ENQUIRER\n\nKeith Davidson testified Tuesday that after tipping off a National Enquirer editor about \"a blockbuster Trump story,\" he soon arranged a meeting with that editor, former Playboy model Karen McDougal and others to see whether the Enquirer's then-parent company was interested.\n\nAfter flying back to New York, Howard told him the Enquirer wasn't keen \"because Karen McDougal lacked documentary evidence of the interaction,\" Davidson testified.\n\nMcDougal had alleged that she had a year-long affair with Donald Trump years earlier.\n\nA month later, Enquirer editor Dylan Howard reached out again to Davidson, suggesting they resume discussions.\n\nAt the time, Davidson warned that the Enquirer's parent company would need to move quickly, writing in one text: \"Time is of the essence. The girl is being cornered by the estrogen mafia\"\n\nDavidson testified that McDougal was \"teetering\" at the time he sent the message and on the verge of signing a deal to tell her story to ABC News.\n\nDavidson also testified that he played the National Enquirer and ABC News against each other to get the best deal for his client. McDougal didn't want to tell her story publicly, which would've been required if she went to ABC, he said.\n\nJURY SEES TEXTS FROM LAWYER PROMISING TABLOID EDITOR A 'BLOCKBUSTER TRUMP STORY'\n\nIn his court testimony on Tuesday, attorney Keith Davidson described representing Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model, in her allegations of a year-long affair with Donald Trump.\n\nAs questioning turned toward Davidson's involvement in some of the hush money deals at the heart of the former president's criminal trial, he said he met McDougal 25 years ago through a friend. He said he started representing in 2016 \"to provide advice and counsel as to what her rights and obligations would be regarding a personal interaction that she had.\"\n\n\"With whom?\" prosecutor Joshua Steinglass asked.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"Donald Trump.\"\n\nShortly after Davidson began representing McDougal, he said, he reached out to Dylan Howard, the editor in chief of the National Enquirer, promising a \"blockbuster Trump story.\"\n\nHoward replied soon after: \"I will get you more than ANYONE for it. You know why.\"\n\nAs the text messages were displayed on screens to the jury, Davidson testified that he didn't know exactly what Howard meant at the time. But, he noted, \"I knew that Dylan's boss David Pecker and Mr. Trump were longtime friends and had a former business relationship,\" he said, adding the tabloid had effectively \"endorsed Mr. Trump's candidacy.\"\n\nSTORMY DANIELS' FORMER LAWYER CALLED TO THE STAND\n\nA lawyer who previously represented former Playboy model Karen McDougal and porn actor Stormy Daniels was the next witness called to the stand in Donald Trump's hush money trial.\n\nKeith Davidson took the stand shortly after noon Tuesday and is known for representing people trying to sell celebrity sex tapes or other embarrassing information.\n\nHe represented McDougal and Daniels in hush money negotiations with the National Enquirer and Trump's then-lawyer Michael Cohen in 2016.\n\nMcDougal claimed she had had a yearlong affair with Trump in the mid-2000s. Daniels claimed she had a one-time sexual encounter with him in 2006. Trump has denied both allegations.\n\nEXECUTIVE CALLED TO THE STAND TO VERIFY TRANSCRIPT, VIDEO OF TRUMP DEPOSITION\n\nAn executive at a company that provides stenographers and videographers for depositions -- sworn, out-of-court statements under oath -- was the next witness called to the stand in Donald Trump's criminal trial on Tuesday.\n\nPhillip Thompson was called to authenticate a transcript and video of a deposition the former president gave in one of writer E. Jean Carroll's federal defamation lawsuits against him.\n\nThe portions included Carroll's lawyer asking Trump about his Truth Social platform, the dates of his marriage to wife Melania Trump and whether he was aware of the \"Access Hollywood\" tape.\n\nThe former longtime Elle magazine advice columnist had alleged that Trump sexually assaulted her in the 1990s and then defamed her after she came forward publicly in 2019. He has said nothing happened between the two of them and called her a \"wack job\" who engineered a \"hoax\" to sell a book.\n\nAfter two federal trials last year and this winter, juries awarded Carroll over $88 million. Trump is appealing.\n\nVIDEOS OF TRUMP DENYING ALLEGATIONS AND PRAISING COHEN PLAYED IN COURT\n\nProsecutors in Donald Trump's hush money case played C-SPAN clips on Tuesday of the then-presidential candidate on the campaign trail in the final weeks leading up to the 2016 election. In the videos, Trump forcefully denied allegations made by several women after his infamous 2005 \"Access Hollywood\" tape was made public.\n\n\"The stories are total fiction. They're 100% made up, they never happened, they never would happen,\" Trump said in video from an Oct. 14, 2016 rally in North Carolina.\n\nAnother clip played for the jury, from January 2017, showed Trump praising Michael Cohen as as good lawyer and friend.\n\nTrump did not appear to react in court to the clips, which were played on monitors throughout the courtroom, including directly in front of him on the defense table.\n\nAfter confirming the veracity of the clips, Robert Browning -- the executive director of C-SPAN's archives -- was dismissed from the witness stand. Trump's attorneys declined to question him.\n\nEXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF C-SPAN ARCHIVES CALLED TO THE STAND\n\nThe next witness called to the stand Tuesday in Donald Trump's hush money trial was Robert Browning, the executive director of the C-SPAN archives.\n\nBrowning, who manages the network's video collection, was called to verify the authenticity of video of a Trump campaign event.\n\nProsecutors are calling people who are regarded as \"records custodians\" to verify evidence in the former president's criminal case.\n\nTRIAL WILL BREAK FOR 4 DAYS OVER MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND\n\nDonald Trump's hush money trial will get an extra day off for the Memorial Day weekend next month.\n\nCourt won't be in session on Friday, May 24, to accommodate a juror who has a flight that morning, Judge Juan M. Merchan said on Tuesday.\n\nThat means the trial will be off for four straight days for the holiday weekend, resuming on Tuesday, May 28. Merchan also informed jurors there will not be court on May 17, though he didn't give them a reason.\n\nThat's the day Donald Trump will be attending his son Barron's high school graduation.\n\nPROSECUTORS WANT TO QUESTION TRUMP ABOUT GAG ORDER VIOLATIONS IF HE TESTIFIES\n\nAhead of a midday break in Donald Trump's hush money case, prosecutors asked the judge to let them question the former president about his gag order violations should he choose to testify.\n\nThe request came after Judge Juan M. Merchan ruled Tuesday morning that Trump had on nine occasions violated a court mandate barring him from speaking publicly about witnesses and jurors in the case. He ultimately fined Trump $9,000 and will hold another hearing Thursday on four more alleged gag order violations.\n\nProsecutors also requested permission to introduce evidence they said shows Trump orchestrated a \"pressure campaign and intimidation effort\" against Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels.\n\nColangelo said Trump's attorney opened the door to that evidence by seeking to undermine the credibility of the two witnesses in opening statements.\n\nMerchan did not immediately rule, but said, \"the door has been opened.\"\n\nHe previously ruled to allow prosecutors to challenge Trump's credibility by questioning him about a limited number of his recent legal setbacks if he ends up taking the witness stand.\n\nTrump has said he wants to testify, but is under no obligation to do so.\n\nNO RED FLAGS ABOUT COHEN'S ACCOUNTS AT THE TIME, FARRO SAYS\n\nIn his cross examination of banker Gary Farro on Tuesday, defense attorney Todd Blanche underscored that Michael Cohen made no mention that the accounts he opened in October 2016 had anything to do with deals involving then-presidential candidate Donald Trump or his company.\n\nIf Cohen had done so, \"I would have asked questions,\" Farro said.\n\nFarro noted that he might not have opened a bank account for Cohen if he'd been told it was for what's known as a shell corporation -- one that receives and sends out money but doesn't have an underlying business.\n\nBut Cohen, the banker said, told him the account was for a real estate consulting business.\n\nNothing about it raised \"any red flags to you?\" Blanche asked.\n\n\"Not based upon the answers I was given to the questions I asked,\" Farro said.\n\nFarro's testimony shed light on his role in helping Cohen open a bank account that was later used to process a $130,000 wire transfer to a lawyer for Stormy Daniels.\n\nDEFENSE BEGINS CROSS-EXAMINATION OF FARRO\n\nDefense attorneys began their cross-examination of Gary Farro, the prosecution's third witness in Donald Trump's hush money trial, by asking the banker to describe his relationship with Michael Cohen.\n\nFarro said he first met Cohen -- then serving as the former president's personal lawyer -- in person at a meeting in Trump Tower, but primarily communicated over the phone. Pushed by Todd Blanche, Farro acknowledged that Cohen wasn't always easy to work with.\n\n\"He was a challenging client because of his desire to get things done so quickly,\" Farro said. \"Ninety percent of the time it was an urgent matter.\"\n\nPROSECUTORS WRAP QUESTIONING OF FARRO\n\nProsecutors have wrapped up questioning of Gary Farro, their third witness in Donald Trump's criminal hush money trial.\n\nFarro told prosecutors on Tuesday that Michael Cohen had indicated that a 2016 $130,000 wire payment now at the heart of the case was related to a real estate transaction -- not a political candidate, an adult film performer or buying up a potential media story.\n\n\"We might consider something like that a reputational risk,\" Farro said.\n\nWithin a day of opening the Essential Consultants LLC bank account on Oct. 26, 2016 -- and funding it with about $130,000 from his own home equity loan -- Cohen wired out $130,000 to Keith Davidson, then a lawyer for Stormy Daniels, documents showed.\n\nThe 2016 presidential election was on Nov. 8.\n\nFAMILY JOINS TRUMP IN COURT FOR THE FIRST TIME\n\nDonald Trump's son Eric joined his father in court on Tuesday, marking the first time any of the former president's family members have attended his criminal hush money trial.\n\nPrior to court proceedings resuming, Trump turned from the defense table and walked over to his son in the first row of the gallery. Trump put his hand on Eric's arm as they chatted.\n\nTrump had railed about the trial, as well as his other legal cases, to reporters on his way into the courtroom earlier in the morning.\n\nFARRO RETURNS TO THE STAND\n\nTestimony in Donald Trump's hush money trial resumed with Gary Farro, a banker who helped Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen open accounts. Cohen used one such account to buy the silence of porn performer Stormy Daniels in the weeks before the 2016 election. She alleged a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump, which he denies.\n\nCohen indicated the account, opened in late October 2016 in the name of Essential Consultants LLC, would be used for real estate consulting, according to testimony and documents shown at the trial.\n\nIn response to prosecutor Becky Mangold's questions, Farro said the bank would have asked more questions if there had been any mention of a connection to a political candidate, buying a story that was being pitched to the media or paying a porn performer.\n\nThe additional scrutiny would have delayed or even nixed opening the account, which Cohen had wanted to open right away. In particular, the adult film world \"is an industry we don't work with,\" he said.\n\nWith only real estate in the picture, the account was opened within a day -- \"very quick,\" Farro said.\n\nMERCHAN FINDS POST ABOUT COHEN AND DANIELS WAS NOT A VIOLATION\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan found that one of Donald Trump's online posts about his former lawyer Michael Cohen and porn actor Stormy Daniels did not violate a gag order barring him from speaking publicly about jurors and witnesses in his hush money case.\n\nMerchan wrote that he was finding Trump \"in criminal contempt for willfully disobeying a lawful mandate\" of the court on nine separate occasions for posts made on Truth Social and his campaign website.\n\nMerchan ruled that Trump's April 10 post referring to Cohen and Daniels as \"sleaze bags\" was not a gag order violation. He said Trump's contention that he was responding to previous posts by Cohen \"is sufficient to give\" him pause \"as to whether the People have met their burden\" as to that post.\n\nHowever, the other nine \"attack the credibility of arguably two of the more high-profile witnesses in this case.\"\n\n\"To allow such attacks upon protected witnesses with blanket assertions that they are all responses to 'political attacks' would be an exception that swallowed the rule. The Expanded Order does not contain such an exception,\" Merchan wrote.\n\nJUDGE FINDS TRUMP VIOLATED GAG ORDER, FINES HIM $9K\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan ruled Tuesday morning that Donald Trump violated a gag order barring him from making public statements about witnesses and jurors in his hush money trial nine times. He fined the former president $9,000 for the violations.\n\nProsecutors had alleged the former president had violated the order 10 times, and Merchan concurred in all but one of those instances. The judge will hold a hearing Thursday on four more alleged violations.\n\nThe former president stared down at the table in front of him as Merchan read the ruling, frowning slightly but otherwise showing no expression.\n\nMerchan wrote in his ruling that Trump \"is hereby warned that the Court will not tolerate continued willful violations of its lawful orders\" and raised the possibility of jail time if \"necessary and appropriate under the circumstances.\"\n\nJUDGE TO ALLOW TRUMP TO ATTEND SON'S GRADUATION\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan said Tuesday morning that Donald Trump's criminal hush money trial will not be held on May 17 so that the former president can attend his son's graduation.\n\n\"I don't think the May 17 date is a problem, so Mr. Trump can certainly attend that date, attend his son's graduation,\" Merchan said.\n\nTrump had previously requested the day off from court to accommodate his son Barron's high school graduation.\n\nTRUMP ARRIVES AT COURT\n\nDonald Trump's motorcade arrived Tuesday morning at the courthouse in lower Manhattan just before 9 a.m., kicking off the second week of witness testimony in the former president's hush money trial.\n\nA crowd of around 60 Trump supporters had gathered across the street from the building, waving Trump and American flags on tall poles.\n\nTRUMP LEAVES TRUMP TOWER FOR COURT\n\nDonald Trump entered his motorcade outside Trump Tower in midtown, headed to the courthouse in lower Manhattan for the second week of trial testimony.\n\nThe former president on Tuesday will be in court for testimony from the third prosecution witness, Gary Farro, a banker who helped Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen open accounts.\n\nCohen used one to buy the silence of porn performer Stormy Daniels. She alleged a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump, which he denies.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

        "text": "[[{\"value\":\"TikTok appears to be quietly showing some users an option to purchase \"coins\" on the web instead of through in-app purchases, circumventing the commission that Apple receives on digital purchases.\n\nAs noted by David Tesler (via TechCrunch) TikTok has been offering a limited number of TikTok app users an option to purchase coins on TikTok.com instead of in the app. \"Try recharging on tiktok.com to avoid in-app service fees,\" reads the text. \"You can save the service fee and get access to popular payment methods.\"\n\nFollowing through and opting to purchase from TikTok.com brings up an interface for using payment options such as PayPal or a credit/debit card. \"Save around 25% with a lower third-party service fee,\" the app suggests. The purchase workflow can be completed entirely in the TikTok app with no requirement to use in-app purchase.\n\nTikTok's coins are used as a way for users to provide \"Gifts\" to creators. Users pay real money for a certain number of coins, and those coins are used for little gift emoji that can be provided to creators. TikTok says that gifts are used to determine the number of \"diamonds\" awarded to content creators, and diamonds can be redeemed for money. A TikTok coin is worth about half a diamond, and 100 diamonds is worth 50 cents, so TikTok is collecting quite a bit of money during the conversion.\n\nApple requires in-app purchase to be used for digital goods and services, and TikTok's \"coins\" presumably count as a digital good. If TikTok is indeed offering customers a way to purchase coins without in-app purchase as suggested by the screenshots from Tesler, then TikTok is breaking Apple's App Store rules.\n\nTikTok coins would likely be considered tips, and Apple has forced other major social networks like Facebook to use in-app purchase for a creator tipping feature. What TikTok is doing is actually similar to the direct purchase options that Epic Games added to the Fortnite app back in 2020, a move that ultimately led to the banning of the Fortnite app and a multi-year legal battle.\n\nMost TikTok users are only able to purchase coins through the in-app purchase interface, and the option to purchase direct from TikTok with a credit or debit card is allegedly a feature showing up only for a small number of users. The option is perhaps being limited to those who have spent a lot of money on coins in the past.\n\nThis article, \"TikTok May Be Breaking App Store Rules by Avoiding Commissions on Tips\" first appeared on MacRumors.com",

        "text": "AP\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Witness testimony in Donald Trump's criminal trial advanced on Tuesday with three people taking the stand, including Keith Davidson, a lawyer who previously represented Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal in hush money negotiations involving the former president.\n\nDavidson's testimony dominated the afternoon, highlighting his interactions with Trump's ex-lawyer Michael Cohen and detailing the lead-up to a deal that ultimately came with a $130,000 payment to Daniels.\n\nTuesday's proceedings, however, kicked off with the judge holding Trump in contempt and fining him $9,000 over nine online posts that he found violated a gag order barring the former president from speaking publicly about jurors and witnesses in the case.\n\nMerchan warned that if Trump does it again, he could be jailed.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Prosecutors say Trump obscured the true nature of those payments and falsely recorded them as legal expenses.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.\n\nThe case is the first-ever criminal trial of a former U.S. president and the first of four prosecutions of Trump to reach a jury.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- Key players: Who's who at Donald Trump's hush money criminal trial\n\n-- The hush money case is just one of Trump's legal cases.

Merchan of bias and of rushing the case, and also saying he should be out campaigning.\n\nTrump was found in contempt of court earlier in the day and fined $9,000 for nine violations of the gag order, which bars him from speaking publicly about witnesses and jurors in the case.\n\nDAVIDSON SAYS HE THOUGHT DANIELS' STORY WOULD 'BE A TORNADO' IF IT GOT OUT\n\nKeith Davidson and Dylan Howard, then-editor of the National Enquirer, texted each other about what Howard called an \"impending storm\" of publicity if Stormy Daniels took her story elsewhere after Michael Cohen failed to make a payment in the deal on time, according to Davidson's testimony and documents shown at the trial on Tuesday.\n\nDavidson wrote to Howard that he believed Daniels and her agent had agreed to bring her story about a sexual encounter with Donald Trump to another publication, and \"I think it'll be a full-on blitz.\"\n\n\"I just felt like there was going to be more than a flurry of activity. I felt like it was going to be a tornado,\" Davidson explained in court.\n\n\"If the story got out,\" Steinglass asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Davidson said.\n\nAsked if Cohen ever told him who he was representing in the Daniels negotiations, Davidson said that he may not have explicitly stated he was working on Trump's behalf -- but the implication was clear.\n\nCOHEN MISSED DEADLINE TO PAY $130K TO STORMY DANIELS, DAVIDSON SAYS\n\nBefore a brief afternoon break in Donald Trump's hush money trial, lawyer Keith Davidson testified Tuesday that Michael Cohen missed an agreed upon deadline for sending a $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels.\n\nAt first, Cohen offered a litany of explanations for the delay, at turns blaming broken computers, Secret Service \"firewalls,\" and the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur. \"The things he was saying didn't really make sense,\" Davidson said of Cohen.\n\nAs the excuses piled up, Davidson said he understood that Cohen \"didn't have the authority to actually spend money.\" He eventually sent an email informing Cohen that the deal involving Daniel's story about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump was off.\n\n\"I thought he was trying to kick the can down the round until after the election,\" Davidson said.\n\nAPPELLATE COURT REJECTS TRUMP'S REQUEST TO STAY HUSH MONEY TRIAL\n\nAs testimony continued in Donald Trump's hush money trial on Tuesday, a five-judge panel in New York state's mid-level appellate court rejected the former president's request for a stay of the proceedings while he appeals several pretrial rulings, including the trial judge's refusal to recuse himself.\n\nTrump had sought the stay prior to the start of jury selection. A lone judge in the appeals court had previously rejected a request for an emergency stay halting the trial.\n\nPSEUDONYMS WERE USED TO DISGUISE PARTIES INVOLVED IN ENQUIRER DEAL, LAWYER TESTIFIES\n\nIn drawing up the deal with the National Enquirer involving Stormy Daniels' story about an alleged sexual encounter with Donald Trump, Keith Davidson testified Tuesday that he used pseudonyms to disguise the parties involved.\n\nStormy Daniels became Peggy Peterson and Donald Trump became David Dennison, according to Davidson.\n\nThe alliterative code names were picked, in part, because Daniels was the plaintiff and Trump was the defendant, the lawyer testified.\n\nAsked by prosecutors in Trump's hush money case if David Dennison was a real person, Davidson said that he played on his high school hockey team.\n\n\"And how does he feel about you now?\" asked prosecutor Josh Steinglass.\n\nDavidson stifled a laugh, then answered: \"He's very upset.\"\n\n'MICHAEL COHEN STEPPED INTO AMI'S SHOES,' DAVIDSON SAYS\n\nStormy Daniels' agent reached a six-figure deal with then-National Enquirer editor Dylan Howard for the tabloid to acquire the rights to her story about a sexual encounter with Donald Trump after his \"Access Hollywood\" tape leaked, Keith Davidson testified Tuesday.\n\nBut then, according to Davidson, Howard backed out.\n\nThe editor instead told Daniels' agent, Gina Rodriguez, to call Michael Cohen and complete the deal directly with him -- but she refused to speak with Cohen after an uncomfortable prior interaction.\n\nRodriguez asked Davidson to step in and negotiate the deal with Cohen, the lawyer testified.\n\nDavidson added that he had numerous interactions with Howard over the years regarding stories. Asked if it was unusual for Howard to direct him to make a deal with a third party like Cohen, Davidson responded: \"This is the only time that ever happened.\"\n\n\"In essence, Michael Cohen stepped into AMI's shoes,\" Davidson said, referring to the name of the Enquirer's parent company at the time, American Media Inc.\n\nDavidson testified that in negotiating with Cohen, he hiked the price to $130,000 -- building in his fee for his work on the deal.\n\n'ACCESS HOLLYWOOD' TAPE LEAK MADE DANIELS' STORY MORE MARKETABLE, LAWYER SAYS\n\nStormy Daniels' story about a sexual encounter with Donald Trump became more marketable after the notorious \"Access Hollywood\" tape was leaked, Keith Davidson testified on Tuesday.\n\nDavidson, who previously represented Daniels, told prosecutors that Daniels' agent, Gina Rodriguez, had been trying to drum up interest in her story earlier in the 2016 election cycle but found there wasn't much.\n\nAsked to describe the \"Access Hollywood\" tape, which can't be shown in court, Davidson testified that it involved Trump and the show's then-host Billy Bush being recorded on a \"hot mic\" and \"some statements by both men that were troublesome.\"\n\n'HE WAS JUST SCREAMING,' LAWYER TESTIFIES OF FIRST INTERACTION WITH COHEN\n\nKeith Davidson on Tuesday testified that his first interaction with Michael Cohen related to a 2011 post on a gossip blog that stated that porn actor Stormy Daniels and Trump had \"some sort of physical or romantic interaction.\"\n\nAfter the blog post was published, Davidson said, Daniels' agent Gina Rodriguez called him and said, \"some jerk called me and was very, very aggressive and threatened to sue me.\"\n\nAsked who the \"jerk\" was, Davidson said: \"Michael Cohen.\"\n\nDavidson testified that when he called Cohen, the ex-Trump lawyer greeted him \"with a hostile barrage of insults and insinuations that went on for quite a while.\"\n\n\"I don't think he was accusing us of anything, he was just screaming,\" Davidson continued. \"Finally, after he finished, I explained to him that I was calling because my client, Stormy Daniels, did not want the story up. I wanted to see if he had done anything\" to try to get the story taken down.\n\nDavidson said he eventually sent a cease-and-desist letter to the blog after the dust up with Cohen and the story was removed.\n\nDAVIDSON SAYS HE UNDERSTOOD THE ENQUIRER WOULD NEVER PUBLISH MCDOUGAL'S STORY\n\nLawyer Keith Davidson testified on Tuesday that back-and-forth haggling took place in the selling of former Playboy model Karen McDougal's story to the National Enquirer.\n\nIn one text message shown to jurors, Davidson told Enquirer editor Dylan Howard that \"they are asking me to go back for another 25,\" meaning another $25,000. Howard responds with an expletive, adding, \"Not my money. I'll ask.\"\n\nBut even as they reached a basic framework for the deal, Davidson described his \"growing frustration with the process.\" At one point, Davidson said he was pushed to call Donald Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen directly, something he said he had been trying to avoid.\n\n\"I thought it was odd, certainly,\" Davidson said about being asked to call Cohen. \"I didn't particularly like dealing with him and that's why I was trying like hell to avoid talking to him,\" he added.\n\nDavidson testified that he understood McDougal's story would never be published and acknowledged that \"there was an unspoken understanding that there was an affiliation between David Pecker and Donald Trump and that AMI wouldn't run this story, any story related to Karen, because it would hurt Donald Trump.\"\n\nTRUMP'S ONLINE POSTS FOUND TO VIOLATE GAG ORDER HAVE BEEN REMOVED\n\nDonald Trump's online posts that on Tuesday were found to violate a gag order barring him from speaking publicly about jurors and witnesses in his criminal hush money trial were removed ahead of an afternoon deadline.\n\nThe posts in question were deleted while the court was in recess for lunch.\n\nLinks to the old Truth Social posts redirected to a \"Not found\" message, while those on Trump's website redirected to a 404 error page.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Judge Juan M. Merchan fined the former president $9,000 for the nine posts for violating the order.\n\nTEXAS AG PAXTON AMONG THOSE IN COURTROOM AS TRUMP'S TRIAL RESUMES\n\nCourt in Donald Trump's criminal trial resumed Tuesday after an early afternoon lunch break.\n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton walked into the courtroom with Trump and his entourage after posting on social media earlier in the day that he was there to support the former president. The Republican sat down in the first row of the courtroom gallery directly behind the defense table.\n\nPaxton sat just a few seats away from Trump's son Eric, who sat near the aisle alongside Susie Wiles, a Trump political operative.\n\nKeith Davidson, a lawyer who previously represented former Playboy model Karen McDougal and porn actor Stormy Daniels in hush money negotiations, was expected to returned to the witness stand.\n\nDAVIDSON SHEDS LIGHT ON SEQUENCE OF EVENTS THAT LED TO THE DEAL WITH THE ENQUIRER\n\nKeith Davidson testified Tuesday that after tipping off a National Enquirer editor about \"a blockbuster Trump story,\" he soon arranged a meeting with that editor, former Playboy model Karen McDougal and others to see whether the Enquirer's then-parent company was interested.\n\nAfter flying back to New York, Howard told him the Enquirer wasn't keen \"because Karen McDougal lacked documentary evidence of the interaction,\" Davidson testified.\n\nMcDougal had alleged that she had a year-long affair with Donald Trump years earlier.\n\nA month later, Enquirer editor Dylan Howard reached out again to Davidson, suggesting they resume discussions.\n\nAt the time, Davidson warned that the Enquirer's parent company would need to move quickly, writing in one text: \"Time is of the essence. The girl is being cornered by the estrogen mafia\"\n\nDavidson testified that McDougal was \"teetering\" at the time he sent the message and on the verge of signing a deal to tell her story to ABC News.\n\nDavidson also testified that he played the National Enquirer and ABC News against each other to get the best deal for his client. McDougal didn't want to tell her story publicly, which would've been required if she went to ABC, he said.\n\nJURY SEES TEXTS FROM LAWYER PROMISING TABLOID EDITOR A 'BLOCKBUSTER TRUMP STORY'\n\nIn his court testimony on Tuesday, attorney Keith Davidson described representing Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model, in her allegations of a year-long affair with Donald Trump.\n\nAs questioning turned toward Davidson's involvement in some of the hush money deals at the heart of the former president's criminal trial, he said he met McDougal 25 years ago through a friend. He said he started representing in 2016 \"to provide advice and counsel as to what her rights and obligations would be regarding a personal interaction that she had.\"\n\n\"With whom?\" prosecutor Joshua Steinglass asked.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"Donald Trump.\"\n\nShortly after Davidson began representing McDougal, he said, he reached out to Dylan Howard, the editor in chief of the National Enquirer, promising a \"blockbuster Trump story.\"\n\nHoward replied soon after: \"I will get you more than ANYONE for it. You know why.\"\n\nAs the text messages were displayed on screens to the jury, Davidson testified that he didn't know exactly what Howard meant at the time. But, he noted, \"I knew that Dylan's boss David Pecker and Mr. Trump were longtime friends and had a former business relationship,\" he said, adding the tabloid had effectively \"endorsed Mr. Trump's candidacy.\"\n\nSTORMY DANIELS' FORMER LAWYER CALLED TO THE STAND\n\nA lawyer who previously represented former Playboy model Karen McDougal and porn actor Stormy Daniels was the next witness called to the stand in Donald Trump's hush money trial.\n\nKeith Davidson took the stand shortly after noon Tuesday and is known for representing people trying to sell celebrity sex tapes or other embarrassing information.\n\nHe represented McDougal and Daniels in hush money negotiations with the National Enquirer and Trump's then-lawyer Michael Cohen in 2016.\n\nMcDougal claimed she had had a yearlong affair with Trump in the mid-2000s. Daniels claimed she had a one-time sexual encounter with him in 2006. Trump has denied both allegations.\n\nEXECUTIVE CALLED TO THE STAND TO VERIFY TRANSCRIPT, VIDEO OF TRUMP DEPOSITION\n\nAn executive at a company that provides stenographers and videographers for depositions -- sworn, out-of-court statements under oath -- was the next witness called to the stand in Donald Trump's criminal trial on Tuesday.\n\nPhillip Thompson was called to authenticate a transcript and video of a deposition the former president gave in one of writer E. Jean Carroll's federal defamation lawsuits against him.\n\nThe portions included Carroll's lawyer asking Trump about his Truth Social platform, the dates of his marriage to wife Melania Trump and whether he was aware of the \"Access Hollywood\" tape.\n\nThe former longtime Elle magazine advice columnist had alleged that Trump sexually assaulted her in the 1990s and then defamed her after she came forward publicly in 2019. He has said nothing happened between the two of them and called her a \"wack job\" who engineered a \"hoax\" to sell a book.\n\nAfter two federal trials last year and this winter, juries awarded Carroll over $88 million. Trump is appealing.\n\nVIDEOS OF TRUMP DENYING ALLEGATIONS AND PRAISING COHEN PLAYED IN COURT\n\nProsecutors in Donald Trump's hush money case played C-SPAN clips on Tuesday of the then-presidential candidate on the campaign trail in the final weeks leading up to the 2016 election. In the videos, Trump forcefully denied allegations made by several women after his infamous 2005 \"Access Hollywood\" tape was made public.\n\n\"The stories are total fiction. They're 100% made up, they never happened, they never would happen,\" Trump said in video from an Oct. 14, 2016 rally in North Carolina.\n\nAnother clip played for the jury, from January 2017, showed Trump praising Michael Cohen as as good lawyer and friend.\n\nTrump did not appear to react in court to the clips, which were played on monitors throughout the courtroom, including directly in front of him on the defense table.\n\nAfter confirming the veracity of the clips, Robert Browning -- the executive director of C-SPAN's archives -- was dismissed from the witness stand. Trump's attorneys declined to question him.\n\nEXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF C-SPAN ARCHIVES CALLED TO THE STAND\n\nThe next witness called to the stand Tuesday in Donald Trump's hush money trial was Robert Browning, the executive director of the C-SPAN archives.\n\nBrowning, who manages the network's video collection, was called to verify the authenticity of video of a Trump campaign event.\n\nProsecutors are calling people who are regarded as \"records custodians\" to verify evidence in the former president's criminal case.\n\nTRIAL WILL BREAK FOR 4 DAYS OVER MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND\n\nDonald Trump's hush money trial will get an extra day off for the Memorial Day weekend next month.\n\nCourt won't be in session on Friday, May 24, to accommodate a juror who has a flight that morning, Judge Juan M. Merchan said on Tuesday.\n\nThat means the trial will be off for four straight days for the holiday weekend, resuming on Tuesday, May 28. Merchan also informed jurors there will not be court on May 17, though he didn't give them a reason.\n\nThat's the day Donald Trump will be attending his son Barron's high school graduation.\n\nPROSECUTORS WANT TO QUESTION TRUMP ABOUT GAG ORDER VIOLATIONS IF HE TESTIFIES\n\nAhead of a midday break in Donald Trump's hush money case, prosecutors asked the judge to let them question the former president about his gag order violations should he choose to testify.\n\nThe request came after Judge Juan M. Merchan ruled Tuesday morning that Trump had on nine occasions violated a court mandate barring him from speaking publicly about witnesses and jurors in the case. He ultimately fined Trump $9,000 and will hold another hearing Thursday on four more alleged gag order violations.\n\nProsecutors also requested permission to introduce evidence they said shows Trump orchestrated a \"pressure campaign and intimidation effort\" against Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels.\n\nColangelo said Trump's attorney opened the door to that evidence by seeking to undermine the credibility of the two witnesses in opening statements.\n\nMerchan did not immediately rule, but said, \"the door has been opened.\"\n\nHe previously ruled to allow prosecutors to challenge Trump's credibility by questioning him about a limited number of his recent legal setbacks if he ends up taking the witness stand.\n\nTrump has said he wants to testify, but is under no obligation to do so.\n\nNO RED FLAGS ABOUT COHEN'S ACCOUNTS AT THE TIME, FARRO SAYS\n\nIn his cross examination of banker Gary Farro on Tuesday, defense attorney Todd Blanche underscored that Michael Cohen made no mention that the accounts he opened in October 2016 had anything to do with deals involving then-presidential candidate Donald Trump or his company.\n\nIf Cohen had done so, \"I would have asked questions,\" Farro said.\n\nFarro noted that he might not have opened a bank account for Cohen if he'd been told it was for what's known as a shell corporation -- one that receives and sends out money but doesn't have an underlying business.\n\nBut Cohen, the banker said, told him the account was for a real estate consulting business.\n\nNothing about it raised \"any red flags to you?\" Blanche asked.\n\n\"Not based upon the answers I was given to the questions I asked,\" Farro said.\n\nFarro's testimony shed light on his role in helping Cohen open a bank account that was later used to process a $130,000 wire transfer to a lawyer for Stormy Daniels.\n\nDEFENSE BEGINS CROSS-EXAMINATION OF FARRO\n\nDefense attorneys began their cross-examination of Gary Farro, the prosecution's third witness in Donald Trump's hush money trial, by asking the banker to describe his relationship with Michael Cohen.\n\nFarro said he first met Cohen -- then serving as the former president's personal lawyer -- in person at a meeting in Trump Tower, but primarily communicated over the phone. Pushed by Todd Blanche, Farro acknowledged that Cohen wasn't always easy to work with.\n\n\"He was a challenging client because of his desire to get things done so quickly,\" Farro said. \"Ninety percent of the time it was an urgent matter.\"\n\nPROSECUTORS WRAP QUESTIONING OF FARRO\n\nProsecutors have wrapped up questioning of Gary Farro, their third witness in Donald Trump's criminal hush money trial.\n\nFarro told prosecutors on Tuesday that Michael Cohen had indicated that a 2016 $130,000 wire payment now at the heart of the case was related to a real estate transaction -- not a political candidate, an adult film performer or buying up a potential media story.\n\n\"We might consider something like that a reputational risk,\" Farro said.\n\nWithin a day of opening the Essential Consultants LLC bank account on Oct. 26, 2016 -- and funding it with about $130,000 from his own home equity loan -- Cohen wired out $130,000 to Keith Davidson, then a lawyer for Stormy Daniels, documents showed.\n\nThe 2016 presidential election was on Nov. 8.\n\nFAMILY JOINS TRUMP IN COURT FOR THE FIRST TIME\n\nDonald Trump's son Eric joined his father in court on Tuesday, marking the first time any of the former president's family members have attended his criminal hush money trial.\n\nPrior to court proceedings resuming, Trump turned from the defense table and walked over to his son in the first row of the gallery. Trump put his hand on Eric's arm as they chatted.\n\nTrump had railed about the trial, as well as his other legal cases, to reporters on his way into the courtroom earlier in the morning.\n\nFARRO RETURNS TO THE STAND\n\nTestimony in Donald Trump's hush money trial resumed with Gary Farro, a banker who helped Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen open accounts. Cohen used one such account to buy the silence of porn performer Stormy Daniels in the weeks before the 2016 election. She alleged a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump, which he denies.\n\nCohen indicated the account, opened in late October 2016 in the name of Essential Consultants LLC, would be used for real estate consulting, according to testimony and documents shown at the trial.\n\nIn response to prosecutor Becky Mangold's questions, Farro said the bank would have asked more questions if there had been any mention of a connection to a political candidate, buying a story that was being pitched to the media or paying a porn performer.\n\nThe additional scrutiny would have delayed or even nixed opening the account, which Cohen had wanted to open right away. In particular, the adult film world \"is an industry we don't work with,\" he said.\n\nWith only real estate in the picture, the account was opened within a day -- \"very quick,\" Farro said.\n\nMERCHAN FINDS POST ABOUT COHEN AND DANIELS WAS NOT A VIOLATION\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan found that one of Donald Trump's online posts about his former lawyer Michael Cohen and porn actor Stormy Daniels did not violate a gag order barring him from speaking publicly about jurors and witnesses in his hush money case.\n\nMerchan wrote that he was finding Trump \"in criminal contempt for willfully disobeying a lawful mandate\" of the court on nine separate occasions for posts made on Truth Social and his campaign website.\n\nMerchan ruled that Trump's April 10 post referring to Cohen and Daniels as \"sleaze bags\" was not a gag order violation. He said Trump's contention that he was responding to previous posts by Cohen \"is sufficient to give\" him pause \"as to whether the People have met their burden\" as to that post.\n\nHowever, the other nine \"attack the credibility of arguably two of the more high-profile witnesses in this case.\"\n\n\"To allow such attacks upon protected witnesses with blanket assertions that they are all responses to 'political attacks' would be an exception that swallowed the rule. The Expanded Order does not contain such an exception,\" Merchan wrote.\n\nJUDGE FINDS TRUMP VIOLATED GAG ORDER, FINES HIM $9K\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan ruled Tuesday morning that Donald Trump violated a gag order barring him from making public statements about witnesses and jurors in his hush money trial nine times. He fined the former president $9,000 for the violations.\n\nProsecutors had alleged the former president had violated the order 10 times, and Merchan concurred in all but one of those instances. The judge will hold a hearing Thursday on four more alleged violations.\n\nThe former president stared down at the table in front of him as Merchan read the ruling, frowning slightly but otherwise showing no expression.\n\nMerchan wrote in his ruling that Trump \"is hereby warned that the Court will not tolerate continued willful violations of its lawful orders\" and raised the possibility of jail time if \"necessary and appropriate under the circumstances.\"\n\nJUDGE TO ALLOW TRUMP TO ATTEND SON'S GRADUATION\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan said Tuesday morning that Donald Trump's criminal hush money trial will not be held on May 17 so that the former president can attend his son's graduation.\n\n\"I don't think the May 17 date is a problem, so Mr. Trump can certainly attend that date, attend his son's graduation,\" Merchan said.\n\nTrump had previously requested the day off from court to accommodate his son Barron's high school graduation.\n\nTRUMP ARRIVES AT COURT\n\nDonald Trump's motorcade arrived Tuesday morning at the courthouse in lower Manhattan just before 9 a.m., kicking off the second week of witness testimony in the former president's hush money trial.\n\nA crowd of around 60 Trump supporters had gathered across the street from the building, waving Trump and American flags on tall poles.\n\nTRUMP LEAVES TRUMP TOWER FOR COURT\n\nDonald Trump entered his motorcade outside Trump Tower in midtown, headed to the courthouse in lower Manhattan for the second week of trial testimony.\n\nThe former president on Tuesday will be in court for testimony from the third prosecution witness, Gary Farro, a banker who helped Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen open accounts.\n\nCohen used one to buy the silence of porn performer Stormy Daniels. She alleged a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump, which he denies.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

        "text": "Did Apple just help China retaliate against America's possible TikTok ban?\n\nApple has long invested heavily in Chinese markets, and, based on a recent report, the company is willing to exercise censorship to maintain those markets. Bloomberg reportedon April 18 that Apple Inc. had removed at least four social media services from its Chinese App Store, including two Meta-owned apps. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which Bloomberg called \"one of the world's most rigid internet censorship regimes,\" demanded that Apple remove the apps over alleged \"national security\" concerns. Apple complied just after President Joe Biden signed a bill forcing TikTok to either relinquish its Chinese communist government ties or leave the country. The process of both bans have been ongoing, however.\n\nBloomberg explained, \"The orders come on the heels of a cleanup program Chinese regulators initiated in 2023 that was expected to remove many defunct or unregistered apps from domestic iOS and Android stores.\" Mobile app developers were reportedly required to complete registration with the CCP by the end of March or be forced to cease operating. The censored apps are Meta's Threads and WhatsApp, along with Signal and Telegram.\n\nIn a statement obtained by Bloomberg, Apple claimed that it disagreed with the CCP's demands but had to follow them. \"We are obligated to follow the laws in the countries where we operate, even when we disagree. The Cyberspace Administration of China ordered the removal of these apps from the China storefront based on their national security concerns,\" Apple stated, per Bloomberg. \"These apps remain available for download on all other storefronts where they appear.\"\n\nThe dictatorial CCP's \"Great Firewall\" has long banned foreign social media apps, including Facebook and Twitter (now X). Asia-Pacific news site The Diplomat, noted that Chinese users can be sentenced to years in prison for criticizing CCP officials.\n\nAmerican companies' operations in Communist China continue to be controversial, as do the operations of Chinese companies in America. President Joe Biden signed a bill a week ago that gives TikTok's Chinese parent company ByteDance a choice between selling TikTok or having the popular app banned. The CCP owns a board seat and maintains a financial stake in ByteDance, and multiple reports claim Chinese employees have access to U.S. TikTok user data, raising national security concerns.",

        "text": "AP\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Witness testimony in Donald Trump's criminal trial advanced on Tuesday with three people taking the stand, including Keith Davidson, a lawyer who previously represented Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal in hush money negotiations involving the former president.\n\nDavidson's testimony dominated the afternoon, highlighting his interactions with Trump's ex-lawyer Michael Cohen and detailing the lead-up to a deal that ultimately came with a $130,000 payment to Daniels.\n\nTuesday's proceedings, however, kicked off with the judge holding Trump in contempt and fining him $9,000 over nine online posts that he found violated a gag order barring the former president from speaking publicly about jurors and witnesses in the case.\n\nMerchan warned that if Trump does it again, he could be jailed.\n\nPeople are also reading...

I felt like it was going to be a tornado,\" Davidson explained in court.\n\n\"If the story got out,\" Steinglass asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Davidson said.\n\nAsked if Cohen ever told him who he was representing in the Daniels negotiations, Davidson said that he may not have explicitly stated he was working on Trump's behalf -- but the implication was clear.\n\nCOHEN MISSED DEADLINE TO PAY $130K TO STORMY DANIELS, DAVIDSON SAYS\n\nBefore a brief afternoon break in Donald Trump's hush money trial, lawyer Keith Davidson testified Tuesday that Michael Cohen missed an agreed upon deadline for sending a $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels.\n\nAt first, Cohen offered a litany of explanations for the delay, at turns blaming broken computers, Secret Service \"firewalls,\" and the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur. \"The things he was saying didn't really make sense,\" Davidson said of Cohen.\n\nAs the excuses piled up, Davidson said he understood that Cohen \"didn't have the authority to actually spend money.\" He eventually sent an email informing Cohen that the deal involving Daniel's story about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump was off.\n\n\"I thought he was trying to kick the can down the round until after the election,\" Davidson said.\n\nAPPELLATE COURT REJECTS TRUMP'S REQUEST TO STAY HUSH MONEY TRIAL\n\nAs testimony continued in Donald Trump's hush money trial on Tuesday, a five-judge panel in New York state's mid-level appellate court rejected the former president's request for a stay of the proceedings while he appeals several pretrial rulings, including the trial judge's refusal to recuse himself.\n\nTrump had sought the stay prior to the start of jury selection. A lone judge in the appeals court had previously rejected a request for an emergency stay halting the trial.\n\nPSEUDONYMS WERE USED TO DISGUISE PARTIES INVOLVED IN ENQUIRER DEAL, LAWYER TESTIFIES\n\nIn drawing up the deal with the National Enquirer involving Stormy Daniels' story about an alleged sexual encounter with Donald Trump, Keith Davidson testified Tuesday that he used pseudonyms to disguise the parties involved.\n\nStormy Daniels became Peggy Peterson and Donald Trump became David Dennison, according to Davidson.\n\nThe alliterative code names were picked, in part, because Daniels was the plaintiff and Trump was the defendant, the lawyer testified.\n\nAsked by prosecutors in Trump's hush money case if David Dennison was a real person, Davidson said that he played on his high school hockey team.\n\n\"And how does he feel about you now?\" asked prosecutor Josh Steinglass.\n\nDavidson stifled a laugh, then answered: \"He's very upset.\"\n\n'MICHAEL COHEN STEPPED INTO AMI'S SHOES,' DAVIDSON SAYS\n\nStormy Daniels' agent reached a six-figure deal with then-National Enquirer editor Dylan Howard for the tabloid to acquire the rights to her story about a sexual encounter with Donald Trump after his \"Access Hollywood\" tape leaked, Keith Davidson testified Tuesday.\n\nBut then, according to Davidson, Howard backed out.\n\nThe editor instead told Daniels' agent, Gina Rodriguez, to call Michael Cohen and complete the deal directly with him -- but she refused to speak with Cohen after an uncomfortable prior interaction.\n\nRodriguez asked Davidson to step in and negotiate the deal with Cohen, the lawyer testified.\n\nDavidson added that he had numerous interactions with Howard over the years regarding stories. Asked if it was unusual for Howard to direct him to make a deal with a third party like Cohen, Davidson responded: \"This is the only time that ever happened.\"\n\n\"In essence, Michael Cohen stepped into AMI's shoes,\" Davidson said, referring to the name of the Enquirer's parent company at the time, American Media Inc.\n\nDavidson testified that in negotiating with Cohen, he hiked the price to $130,000 -- building in his fee for his work on the deal.\n\n'ACCESS HOLLYWOOD' TAPE LEAK MADE DANIELS' STORY MORE MARKETABLE, LAWYER SAYS\n\nStormy Daniels' story about a sexual encounter with Donald Trump became more marketable after the notorious \"Access Hollywood\" tape was leaked, Keith Davidson testified on Tuesday.\n\nDavidson, who previously represented Daniels, told prosecutors that Daniels' agent, Gina Rodriguez, had been trying to drum up interest in her story earlier in the 2016 election cycle but found there wasn't much.\n\nAsked to describe the \"Access Hollywood\" tape, which can't be shown in court, Davidson testified that it involved Trump and the show's then-host Billy Bush being recorded on a \"hot mic\" and \"some statements by both men that were troublesome.\"\n\n'HE WAS JUST SCREAMING,' LAWYER TESTIFIES OF FIRST INTERACTION WITH COHEN\n\nKeith Davidson on Tuesday testified that his first interaction with Michael Cohen related to a 2011 post on a gossip blog that stated that porn actor Stormy Daniels and Trump had \"some sort of physical or romantic interaction.\"\n\nAfter the blog post was published, Davidson said, Daniels' agent Gina Rodriguez called him and said, \"some jerk called me and was very, very aggressive and threatened to sue me.\"\n\nAsked who the \"jerk\" was, Davidson said: \"Michael Cohen.\"\n\nDavidson testified that when he called Cohen, the ex-Trump lawyer greeted him \"with a hostile barrage of insults and insinuations that went on for quite a while.\"\n\n\"I don't think he was accusing us of anything, he was just screaming,\" Davidson continued. \"Finally, after he finished, I explained to him that I was calling because my client, Stormy Daniels, did not want the story up. I wanted to see if he had done anything\" to try to get the story taken down.\n\nDavidson said he eventually sent a cease-and-desist letter to the blog after the dust up with Cohen and the story was removed.\n\nDAVIDSON SAYS HE UNDERSTOOD THE ENQUIRER WOULD NEVER PUBLISH MCDOUGAL'S STORY\n\nLawyer Keith Davidson testified on Tuesday that back-and-forth haggling took place in the selling of former Playboy model Karen McDougal's story to the National Enquirer.\n\nIn one text message shown to jurors, Davidson told Enquirer editor Dylan Howard that \"they are asking me to go back for another 25,\" meaning another $25,000. Howard responds with an expletive, adding, \"Not my money. I'll ask.\"\n\nBut even as they reached a basic framework for the deal, Davidson described his \"growing frustration with the process.\" At one point, Davidson said he was pushed to call Donald Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen directly, something he said he had been trying to avoid.\n\n\"I thought it was odd, certainly,\" Davidson said about being asked to call Cohen. \"I didn't particularly like dealing with him and that's why I was trying like hell to avoid talking to him,\" he added.\n\nDavidson testified that he understood McDougal's story would never be published and acknowledged that \"there was an unspoken understanding that there was an affiliation between David Pecker and Donald Trump and that AMI wouldn't run this story, any story related to Karen, because it would hurt Donald Trump.\"\n\nTRUMP'S ONLINE POSTS FOUND TO VIOLATE GAG ORDER HAVE BEEN REMOVED\n\nDonald Trump's online posts that on Tuesday were found to violate a gag order barring him from speaking publicly about jurors and witnesses in his criminal hush money trial were removed ahead of an afternoon deadline.\n\nThe posts in question were deleted while the court was in recess for lunch.\n\nLinks to the old Truth Social posts redirected to a \"Not found\" message, while those on Trump's website redirected to a 404 error page.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Judge Juan M. Merchan fined the former president $9,000 for the nine posts for violating the order.\n\nTEXAS AG PAXTON AMONG THOSE IN COURTROOM AS TRUMP'S TRIAL RESUMES\n\nCourt in Donald Trump's criminal trial resumed Tuesday after an early afternoon lunch break.\n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton walked into the courtroom with Trump and his entourage after posting on social media earlier in the day that he was there to support the former president. The Republican sat down in the first row of the courtroom gallery directly behind the defense table.\n\nPaxton sat just a few seats away from Trump's son Eric, who sat near the aisle alongside Susie Wiles, a Trump political operative.\n\nKeith Davidson, a lawyer who previously represented former Playboy model Karen McDougal and porn actor Stormy Daniels in hush money negotiations, was expected to returned to the witness stand.\n\nDAVIDSON SHEDS LIGHT ON SEQUENCE OF EVENTS THAT LED TO THE DEAL WITH THE ENQUIRER\n\nKeith Davidson testified Tuesday that after tipping off a National Enquirer editor about \"a blockbuster Trump story,\" he soon arranged a meeting with that editor, former Playboy model Karen McDougal and others to see whether the Enquirer's then-parent company was interested.\n\nAfter flying back to New York, Howard told him the Enquirer wasn't keen \"because Karen McDougal lacked documentary evidence of the interaction,\" Davidson testified.\n\nMcDougal had alleged that she had a year-long affair with Donald Trump years earlier.\n\nA month later, Enquirer editor Dylan Howard reached out again to Davidson, suggesting they resume discussions.\n\nAt the time, Davidson warned that the Enquirer's parent company would need to move quickly, writing in one text: \"Time is of the essence. The girl is being cornered by the estrogen mafia\"\n\nDavidson testified that McDougal was \"teetering\" at the time he sent the message and on the verge of signing a deal to tell her story to ABC News.\n\nDavidson also testified that he played the National Enquirer and ABC News against each other to get the best deal for his client. McDougal didn't want to tell her story publicly, which would've been required if she went to ABC, he said.\n\nJURY SEES TEXTS FROM LAWYER PROMISING TABLOID EDITOR A 'BLOCKBUSTER TRUMP STORY'\n\nIn his court testimony on Tuesday, attorney Keith Davidson described representing Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model, in her allegations of a year-long affair with Donald Trump.\n\nAs questioning turned toward Davidson's involvement in some of the hush money deals at the heart of the former president's criminal trial, he said he met McDougal 25 years ago through a friend. He said he started representing in 2016 \"to provide advice and counsel as to what her rights and obligations would be regarding a personal interaction that she had.\"\n\n\"With whom?\" prosecutor Joshua Steinglass asked.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"Donald Trump.\"\n\nShortly after Davidson began representing McDougal, he said, he reached out to Dylan Howard, the editor in chief of the National Enquirer, promising a \"blockbuster Trump story.\"\n\nHoward replied soon after: \"I will get you more than ANYONE for it. You know why.\"\n\nAs the text messages were displayed on screens to the jury, Davidson testified that he didn't know exactly what Howard meant at the time. But, he noted, \"I knew that Dylan's boss David Pecker and Mr. Trump were longtime friends and had a former business relationship,\" he said, adding the tabloid had effectively \"endorsed Mr. Trump's candidacy.\"\n\nSTORMY DANIELS' FORMER LAWYER CALLED TO THE STAND\n\nA lawyer who previously represented former Playboy model Karen McDougal and porn actor Stormy Daniels was the next witness called to the stand in Donald Trump's hush money trial.\n\nKeith Davidson took the stand shortly after noon Tuesday and is known for representing people trying to sell celebrity sex tapes or other embarrassing information.\n\nHe represented McDougal and Daniels in hush money negotiations with the National Enquirer and Trump's then-lawyer Michael Cohen in 2016.\n\nMcDougal claimed she had had a yearlong affair with Trump in the mid-2000s. Daniels claimed she had a one-time sexual encounter with him in 2006. Trump has denied both allegations.\n\nEXECUTIVE CALLED TO THE STAND TO VERIFY TRANSCRIPT, VIDEO OF TRUMP DEPOSITION\n\nAn executive at a company that provides stenographers and videographers for depositions -- sworn, out-of-court statements under oath -- was the next witness called to the stand in Donald Trump's criminal trial on Tuesday.\n\nPhillip Thompson was called to authenticate a transcript and video of a deposition the former president gave in one of writer E. Jean Carroll's federal defamation lawsuits against him.\n\nThe portions included Carroll's lawyer asking Trump about his Truth Social platform, the dates of his marriage to wife Melania Trump and whether he was aware of the \"Access Hollywood\" tape.\n\nThe former longtime Elle magazine advice columnist had alleged that Trump sexually assaulted her in the 1990s and then defamed her after she came forward publicly in 2019. He has said nothing happened between the two of them and called her a \"wack job\" who engineered a \"hoax\" to sell a book.\n\nAfter two federal trials last year and this winter, juries awarded Carroll over $88 million. Trump is appealing.\n\nVIDEOS OF TRUMP DENYING ALLEGATIONS AND PRAISING COHEN PLAYED IN COURT\n\nProsecutors in Donald Trump's hush money case played C-SPAN clips on Tuesday of the then-presidential candidate on the campaign trail in the final weeks leading up to the 2016 election. In the videos, Trump forcefully denied allegations made by several women after his infamous 2005 \"Access Hollywood\" tape was made public.\n\n\"The stories are total fiction. They're 100% made up, they never happened, they never would happen,\" Trump said in video from an Oct. 14, 2016 rally in North Carolina.\n\nAnother clip played for the jury, from January 2017, showed Trump praising Michael Cohen as as good lawyer and friend.\n\nTrump did not appear to react in court to the clips, which were played on monitors throughout the courtroom, including directly in front of him on the defense table.\n\nAfter confirming the veracity of the clips, Robert Browning -- the executive director of C-SPAN's archives -- was dismissed from the witness stand. Trump's attorneys declined to question him.\n\nEXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF C-SPAN ARCHIVES CALLED TO THE STAND\n\nThe next witness called to the stand Tuesday in Donald Trump's hush money trial was Robert Browning, the executive director of the C-SPAN archives.\n\nBrowning, who manages the network's video collection, was called to verify the authenticity of video of a Trump campaign event.\n\nProsecutors are calling people who are regarded as \"records custodians\" to verify evidence in the former president's criminal case.\n\nTRIAL WILL BREAK FOR 4 DAYS OVER MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND\n\nDonald Trump's hush money trial will get an extra day off for the Memorial Day weekend next month.\n\nCourt won't be in session on Friday, May 24, to accommodate a juror who has a flight that morning, Judge Juan M. Merchan said on Tuesday.\n\nThat means the trial will be off for four straight days for the holiday weekend, resuming on Tuesday, May 28. Merchan also informed jurors there will not be court on May 17, though he didn't give them a reason.\n\nThat's the day Donald Trump will be attending his son Barron's high school graduation.\n\nPROSECUTORS WANT TO QUESTION TRUMP ABOUT GAG ORDER VIOLATIONS IF HE TESTIFIES\n\nAhead of a midday break in Donald Trump's hush money case, prosecutors asked the judge to let them question the former president about his gag order violations should he choose to testify.\n\nThe request came after Judge Juan M. Merchan ruled Tuesday morning that Trump had on nine occasions violated a court mandate barring him from speaking publicly about witnesses and jurors in the case. He ultimately fined Trump $9,000 and will hold another hearing Thursday on four more alleged gag order violations.\n\nProsecutors also requested permission to introduce evidence they said shows Trump orchestrated a \"pressure campaign and intimidation effort\" against Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels.\n\nColangelo said Trump's attorney opened the door to that evidence by seeking to undermine the credibility of the two witnesses in opening statements.\n\nMerchan did not immediately rule, but said, \"the door has been opened.\"\n\nHe previously ruled to allow prosecutors to challenge Trump's credibility by questioning him about a limited number of his recent legal setbacks if he ends up taking the witness stand.\n\nTrump has said he wants to testify, but is under no obligation to do so.\n\nNO RED FLAGS ABOUT COHEN'S ACCOUNTS AT THE TIME, FARRO SAYS\n\nIn his cross examination of banker Gary Farro on Tuesday, defense attorney Todd Blanche underscored that Michael Cohen made no mention that the accounts he opened in October 2016 had anything to do with deals involving then-presidential candidate Donald Trump or his company.\n\nIf Cohen had done so, \"I would have asked questions,\" Farro said.\n\nFarro noted that he might not have opened a bank account for Cohen if he'd been told it was for what's known as a shell corporation -- one that receives and sends out money but doesn't have an underlying business.\n\nBut Cohen, the banker said, told him the account was for a real estate consulting business.\n\nNothing about it raised \"any red flags to you?\" Blanche asked.\n\n\"Not based upon the answers I was given to the questions I asked,\" Farro said.\n\nFarro's testimony shed light on his role in helping Cohen open a bank account that was later used to process a $130,000 wire transfer to a lawyer for Stormy Daniels.\n\nDEFENSE BEGINS CROSS-EXAMINATION OF FARRO\n\nDefense attorneys began their cross-examination of Gary Farro, the prosecution's third witness in Donald Trump's hush money trial, by asking the banker to describe his relationship with Michael Cohen.\n\nFarro said he first met Cohen -- then serving as the former president's personal lawyer -- in person at a meeting in Trump Tower, but primarily communicated over the phone. Pushed by Todd Blanche, Farro acknowledged that Cohen wasn't always easy to work with.\n\n\"He was a challenging client because of his desire to get things done so quickly,\" Farro said. \"Ninety percent of the time it was an urgent matter.\"\n\nPROSECUTORS WRAP QUESTIONING OF FARRO\n\nProsecutors have wrapped up questioning of Gary Farro, their third witness in Donald Trump's criminal hush money trial.\n\nFarro told prosecutors on Tuesday that Michael Cohen had indicated that a 2016 $130,000 wire payment now at the heart of the case was related to a real estate transaction -- not a political candidate, an adult film performer or buying up a potential media story.\n\n\"We might consider something like that a reputational risk,\" Farro said.\n\nWithin a day of opening the Essential Consultants LLC bank account on Oct. 26, 2016 -- and funding it with about $130,000 from his own home equity loan -- Cohen wired out $130,000 to Keith Davidson, then a lawyer for Stormy Daniels, documents showed.\n\nThe 2016 presidential election was on Nov. 8.\n\nFAMILY JOINS TRUMP IN COURT FOR THE FIRST TIME\n\nDonald Trump's son Eric joined his father in court on Tuesday, marking the first time any of the former president's family members have attended his criminal hush money trial.\n\nPrior to court proceedings resuming, Trump turned from the defense table and walked over to his son in the first row of the gallery. Trump put his hand on Eric's arm as they chatted.\n\nTrump had railed about the trial, as well as his other legal cases, to reporters on his way into the courtroom earlier in the morning.\n\nFARRO RETURNS TO THE STAND\n\nTestimony in Donald Trump's hush money trial resumed with Gary Farro, a banker who helped Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen open accounts. Cohen used one such account to buy the silence of porn performer Stormy Daniels in the weeks before the 2016 election. She alleged a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump, which he denies.\n\nCohen indicated the account, opened in late October 2016 in the name of Essential Consultants LLC, would be used for real estate consulting, according to testimony and documents shown at the trial.\n\nIn response to prosecutor Becky Mangold's questions, Farro said the bank would have asked more questions if there had been any mention of a connection to a political candidate, buying a story that was being pitched to the media or paying a porn performer.\n\nThe additional scrutiny would have delayed or even nixed opening the account, which Cohen had wanted to open right away. In particular, the adult film world \"is an industry we don't work with,\" he said.\n\nWith only real estate in the picture, the account was opened within a day -- \"very quick,\" Farro said.\n\nMERCHAN FINDS POST ABOUT COHEN AND DANIELS WAS NOT A VIOLATION\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan found that one of Donald Trump's online posts about his former lawyer Michael Cohen and porn actor Stormy Daniels did not violate a gag order barring him from speaking publicly about jurors and witnesses in his hush money case.\n\nMerchan wrote that he was finding Trump \"in criminal contempt for willfully disobeying a lawful mandate\" of the court on nine separate occasions for posts made on Truth Social and his campaign website.\n\nMerchan ruled that Trump's April 10 post referring to Cohen and Daniels as \"sleaze bags\" was not a gag order violation. He said Trump's contention that he was responding to previous posts by Cohen \"is sufficient to give\" him pause \"as to whether the People have met their burden\" as to that post.\n\nHowever, the other nine \"attack the credibility of arguably two of the more high-profile witnesses in this case.\"\n\n\"To allow such attacks upon protected witnesses with blanket assertions that they are all responses to 'political attacks' would be an exception that swallowed the rule. The Expanded Order does not contain such an exception,\" Merchan wrote.\n\nJUDGE FINDS TRUMP VIOLATED GAG ORDER, FINES HIM $9K\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan ruled Tuesday morning that Donald Trump violated a gag order barring him from making public statements about witnesses and jurors in his hush money trial nine times. He fined the former president $9,000 for the violations.\n\nProsecutors had alleged the former president had violated the order 10 times, and Merchan concurred in all but one of those instances. The judge will hold a hearing Thursday on four more alleged violations.\n\nThe former president stared down at the table in front of him as Merchan read the ruling, frowning slightly but otherwise showing no expression.\n\nMerchan wrote in his ruling that Trump \"is hereby warned that the Court will not tolerate continued willful violations of its lawful orders\" and raised the possibility of jail time if \"necessary and appropriate under the circumstances.\"\n\nJUDGE TO ALLOW TRUMP TO ATTEND SON'S GRADUATION\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan said Tuesday morning that Donald Trump's criminal hush money trial will not be held on May 17 so that the former president can attend his son's graduation.\n\n\"I don't think the May 17 date is a problem, so Mr. Trump can certainly attend that date, attend his son's graduation,\" Merchan said.\n\nTrump had previously requested the day off from court to accommodate his son Barron's high school graduation.\n\nTRUMP ARRIVES AT COURT\n\nDonald Trump's motorcade arrived Tuesday morning at the courthouse in lower Manhattan just before 9 a.m., kicking off the second week of witness testimony in the former president's hush money trial.\n\nA crowd of around 60 Trump supporters had gathered across the street from the building, waving Trump and American flags on tall poles.\n\nTRUMP LEAVES TRUMP TOWER FOR COURT\n\nDonald Trump entered his motorcade outside Trump Tower in midtown, headed to the courthouse in lower Manhattan for the second week of trial testimony.\n\nThe former president on Tuesday will be in court for testimony from the third prosecution witness, Gary Farro, a banker who helped Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen open accounts.\n\nCohen used one to buy the silence of porn performer Stormy Daniels. She alleged a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump, which he denies.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

        "text": "In the dynamic world of hospitality, where every moment counts and guest expectations evolve rapidly, staying ahead is not just a necessity but a strategic imperative. Enter P3 Hotel Software, a pioneer in revolutionizing the guest journey through innovative technology solutions. At the forefront of this revolution is P3's Online Check-in product, a game-changer in streamlining operations and enhancing the guest experience.\n\nThis Online Check-in solution was launched 4 years ago, prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, and has gone from strength to strength as the hospitality industry recovered and emerged from testing global circumstances. Conversion rates for this product are recorded based on a measurement of the total number of guests receiving the pre-check-in email and the total number of guests completing the online pre-check-in process.\n\nP3's 2024 data shows that clients implementing the company's Online Check-in product are recording an average conversion rate of 26% with rates ranging from 8% to 85% depending on hotel type and implementation strategy.\n\nP3's Online Check-in solution isn't just about simplifying front-desk operations; it's about ushering in a new era of contactless experiences tailored to each hotel's unique brand. Integrated seamlessly into the hotel's website, this solution eliminates the need for cumbersome apps or downloads, offering guests a quick and hassle-free check-in process. As a Strategic Oracle Partner, P3's Online Check-in solution is certified with Oracle Validated Integration, guaranteeing a robust and reliable experience for both hotels and guests.\n\nUnlocking the Benefits: From Efficiency to Revenue Maximization\n\nIn today's competitive landscape, where labor shortages and shifting guest demands pose significant challenges, hotels must embrace automation to remain competitive. P3's Online Check-in product offers a multitude of benefits, from streamlining operations and enabling instant online payments to enhancing brand presence and boosting direct revenue. By reducing friction points and enhancing the guest experience, hotels can achieve tangible efficiencies while maximising revenue potential.\n\nP3's conversion rate data provides intriguing insights into the adoption of online check-in across various market segments. Notably, city center locations show above-average online check-in conversion rates, despite many guests visiting for business trips, which typically lack the excitement associated with leisure travel. Rural settings also witness high online check-in rates, aligning with the enthusiasm of leisure-oriented guests keen to kickstart their vacations seamlessly.\n\nA notable disparity arises between Irish and UK hotels, however, with Irish establishments exhibiting an average online check-in conversion rate of 19%, a value 7% lower than the overall average. UK hotels, on the other hand, report an average online check-in conversion rate of 29%. Cultural differences between hospitality approaches may contribute to this contrast, however, further research is required to determine the impact of these factors on online check-in conversion rates.\n\nP3 CEO Phelim Pekaar highlights the pivotal role of effective email and SMS communication in driving online check-in conversion rates. He advocates for concise, persuasive messages with strong calls to action (CTAs) placed prominently, emphasizing benefits like skipping queues for a seamless arrival experience. Pekaar recommends sending reminder emails five and three days before the stay, coupled with a text message reminder on the morning of arrival. Additionally, ensuring guests have an email address on file and routinely cleaning mobile numbers are essential practices. Pekaar also highlights the positive correlation between guests booking directly on client hotel websites and online check-in conversion rates. Encountering a familiar branded interface, which mirrors their online booking experience with the P3 Booking Engine, makes guests feel more comfortable and encourages loyalty. This emphasizes the complementary nature of P3's products, with both the booking engine and online check-in products going hand-in-hand to drive up hotel revenue, streamline operations, and foster greater customer loyalty.\n\nThe Benefits of P3 Kiosks' \"Collect Your Key\" Feature on Online Check-in Conversion\n\nP3's integration of online check-in with self-serve kiosks, featuring the \"collect your key\" element, serves as a vital interim solution until Mobile Key technology becomes available through Apple and Google Wallet. This innovative approach has significantly improved guest experiences at one of P3's client hotel groups, streamlining the check-in process and reducing wait times across a number of properties. Notably, this client has observed a 45% increase in online check-in conversions year-on-year within a recent five-week period, highlighting the practical benefits of P3's solutions. This emphasizes the capabilities of combining online check-in with self-serve kiosks in enhancing guest satisfaction and operational efficiency.\n\nA recent innovative approach exemplified by a P3 client highlights the influence of email incentives in bridging the gap between direct bookings and those facilitated through Online Travel Agencies (OTAs). By offering OTA bookers a complimentary drink upon arrival after checking-in online, this client successfully encouraged guests to provide their contact information, thereby enriching the hotel's database for targeted marketing initiatives. The results are compelling: prior to the implementation of the incentive, OTA online check-in conversion rates lagged behind the overall conversion rates by 5.5%. However, within two months of launching the drink incentive, the gap significantly narrowed to a mere 1.25%. Taking the client's most popular London establishment as a case in point, the introduction of the incentive led to an impressive surge in OTA bookers' online check-in conversion rate by 14.87%. This evidence shows how powerful email incentives can be in boosting online check-in conversion rates, strengthening the hotel's direct booking channels, and encouraging more meaningful guest engagement.\n\nP3 Hotel Software's Online Check-in product is not only about convenience; it's about shaping the future of hospitality. By embracing contactless solutions and leveraging insightful trends, hotels can unlock new avenues for efficiency, revenue generation, and guest satisfaction. As the industry evolves, P3 remains steadfast in its commitment to empowering hotels with cutting-edge technology, ensuring that each guest journey is not just memorable but truly extraordinary.",

Housing Coalition data, which was higher than every county in the Charlotte Metropolitan area.\n\nThe difficult backdrop makes it all the more encouraging that Concord resident DeMarcus Kennedy, after being forced to move twice because of exorbitant rent prices, was able to secure a stable future for his three children when he recently became a homeowner for the first time.\n\nPeople are also reading...

        "text": "AP\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Witness testimony in Donald Trump's criminal trial advanced on Tuesday with three people taking the stand, including Keith Davidson, a lawyer who previously represented Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal in hush money negotiations involving the former president.\n\nDavidson's testimony dominated the afternoon, highlighting his interactions with Trump's ex-lawyer Michael Cohen and detailing the lead-up to a deal that ultimately came with a $130,000 payment to Daniels.\n\nTuesday's proceedings, however, kicked off with the judge holding Trump in contempt and fining him $9,000 over nine online posts that he found violated a gag order barring the former president from speaking publicly about jurors and witnesses in the case.\n\nMerchan warned that if Trump does it again, he could be jailed.\n\nWhen court resumes Thursday, another hearing will be held on four more alleged gag order violations.\n\nA New York state appeals court on Tuesday also rejected Trump's request for a stay of the trial while he appeals several pretrial rulings, including the trial judge's refusal to recuse himself.\n\nThe charges in the case center on $130,000 in payments that Trump's company made to Cohen. Prosecutors say Trump obscured the true nature of those payments and falsely recorded them as legal expenses.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.\n\nThe case is the first-ever criminal trial of a former U.S. president and the first of four prosecutions of Trump to reach a jury.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- Key players: Who's who at Donald Trump's hush money criminal trial\n\n-- The hush money case is just one of Trump's legal cases. See the others here\n\n-- Read the judge's full order on Donald Trump's gag order violations\n\n-- Trump and DeSantis meet to make peace and discuss fundraising for the former president's campaign\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nTRUMP HITS OUT AT GAG ORDER AS COURT ADJOURNS FOR THE DAY\n\nDonald Trump complained about the gag order in his hush money trial, as well as other things as he left the courthouse Tuesday following the adjournment of the day's proceedings.\n\nThe former president approached news cameras in the courthouse hallway on his way out and hit on familiar themes, including accusing Judge Juan M. Merchan of bias and of rushing the case, and also saying he should be out campaigning.\n\nTrump was found in contempt of court earlier in the day and fined $9,000 for nine violations of the gag order, which bars him from speaking publicly about witnesses and jurors in the case.\n\nDAVIDSON SAYS HE THOUGHT DANIELS' STORY WOULD 'BE A TORNADO' IF IT GOT OUT\n\nKeith Davidson and Dylan Howard, then-editor of the National Enquirer, texted each other about what Howard called an \"impending storm\" of publicity if Stormy Daniels took her story elsewhere after Michael Cohen failed to make a payment in the deal on time, according to Davidson's testimony and documents shown at the trial on Tuesday.\n\nDavidson wrote to Howard that he believed Daniels and her agent had agreed to bring her story about a sexual encounter with Donald Trump to another publication, and \"I think it'll be a full-on blitz.\"\n\n\"I just felt like there was going to be more than a flurry of activity. I felt like it was going to be a tornado,\" Davidson explained in court.\n\n\"If the story got out,\" Steinglass asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Davidson said.\n\nAsked if Cohen ever told him who he was representing in the Daniels negotiations, Davidson said that he may not have explicitly stated he was working on Trump's behalf -- but the implication was clear.\n\nCOHEN MISSED DEADLINE TO PAY $130K TO STORMY DANIELS, DAVIDSON SAYS\n\nBefore a brief afternoon break in Donald Trump's hush money trial, lawyer Keith Davidson testified Tuesday that Michael Cohen missed an agreed upon deadline for sending a $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels.\n\nAt first, Cohen offered a litany of explanations for the delay, at turns blaming broken computers, Secret Service \"firewalls,\" and the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur. \"The things he was saying didn't really make sense,\" Davidson said of Cohen.\n\nAs the excuses piled up, Davidson said he understood that Cohen \"didn't have the authority to actually spend money.\" He eventually sent an email informing Cohen that the deal involving Daniel's story about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump was off.\n\n\"I thought he was trying to kick the can down the round until after the election,\" Davidson said.\n\nAPPELLATE COURT REJECTS TRUMP'S REQUEST TO STAY HUSH MONEY TRIAL\n\nAs testimony continued in Donald Trump's hush money trial on Tuesday, a five-judge panel in New York state's mid-level appellate court rejected the former president's request for a stay of the proceedings while he appeals several pretrial rulings, including the trial judge's refusal to recuse himself.\n\nTrump had sought the stay prior to the start of jury selection. A lone judge in the appeals court had previously rejected a request for an emergency stay halting the trial.\n\nPSEUDONYMS WERE USED TO DISGUISE PARTIES INVOLVED IN ENQUIRER DEAL, LAWYER TESTIFIES\n\nIn drawing up the deal with the National Enquirer involving Stormy Daniels' story about an alleged sexual encounter with Donald Trump, Keith Davidson testified Tuesday that he used pseudonyms to disguise the parties involved.\n\nStormy Daniels became Peggy Peterson and Donald Trump became David Dennison, according to Davidson.\n\nThe alliterative code names were picked, in part, because Daniels was the plaintiff and Trump was the defendant, the lawyer testified.\n\nAsked by prosecutors in Trump's hush money case if David Dennison was a real person, Davidson said that he played on his high school hockey team.\n\n\"And how does he feel about you now?\" asked prosecutor Josh Steinglass.\n\nDavidson stifled a laugh, then answered: \"He's very upset.\"\n\n'MICHAEL COHEN STEPPED INTO AMI'S SHOES,' DAVIDSON SAYS\n\nStormy Daniels' agent reached a six-figure deal with then-National Enquirer editor Dylan Howard for the tabloid to acquire the rights to her story about a sexual encounter with Donald Trump after his \"Access Hollywood\" tape leaked, Keith Davidson testified Tuesday.\n\nBut then, according to Davidson, Howard backed out.\n\nThe editor instead told Daniels' agent, Gina Rodriguez, to call Michael Cohen and complete the deal directly with him -- but she refused to speak with Cohen after an uncomfortable prior interaction.\n\nRodriguez asked Davidson to step in and negotiate the deal with Cohen, the lawyer testified.\n\nDavidson added that he had numerous interactions with Howard over the years regarding stories. Asked if it was unusual for Howard to direct him to make a deal with a third party like Cohen, Davidson responded: \"This is the only time that ever happened.\"\n\n\"In essence, Michael Cohen stepped into AMI's shoes,\" Davidson said, referring to the name of the Enquirer's parent company at the time, American Media Inc.\n\nDavidson testified that in negotiating with Cohen, he hiked the price to $130,000 -- building in his fee for his work on the deal.\n\n'ACCESS HOLLYWOOD' TAPE LEAK MADE DANIELS' STORY MORE MARKETABLE, LAWYER SAYS\n\nStormy Daniels' story about a sexual encounter with Donald Trump became more marketable after the notorious \"Access Hollywood\" tape was leaked, Keith Davidson testified on Tuesday.\n\nDavidson, who previously represented Daniels, told prosecutors that Daniels' agent, Gina Rodriguez, had been trying to drum up interest in her story earlier in the 2016 election cycle but found there wasn't much.\n\nAsked to describe the \"Access Hollywood\" tape, which can't be shown in court, Davidson testified that it involved Trump and the show's then-host Billy Bush being recorded on a \"hot mic\" and \"some statements by both men that were troublesome.\"\n\n'HE WAS JUST SCREAMING,' LAWYER TESTIFIES OF FIRST INTERACTION WITH COHEN\n\nKeith Davidson on Tuesday testified that his first interaction with Michael Cohen related to a 2011 post on a gossip blog that stated that porn actor Stormy Daniels and Trump had \"some sort of physical or romantic interaction.\"\n\nAfter the blog post was published, Davidson said, Daniels' agent Gina Rodriguez called him and said, \"some jerk called me and was very, very aggressive and threatened to sue me.\"\n\nAsked who the \"jerk\" was, Davidson said: \"Michael Cohen.\"\n\nDavidson testified that when he called Cohen, the ex-Trump lawyer greeted him \"with a hostile barrage of insults and insinuations that went on for quite a while.\"\n\n\"I don't think he was accusing us of anything, he was just screaming,\" Davidson continued. \"Finally, after he finished, I explained to him that I was calling because my client, Stormy Daniels, did not want the story up. I wanted to see if he had done anything\" to try to get the story taken down.\n\nDavidson said he eventually sent a cease-and-desist letter to the blog after the dust up with Cohen and the story was removed.\n\nDAVIDSON SAYS HE UNDERSTOOD THE ENQUIRER WOULD NEVER PUBLISH MCDOUGAL'S STORY\n\nLawyer Keith Davidson testified on Tuesday that back-and-forth haggling took place in the selling of former Playboy model Karen McDougal's story to the National Enquirer.\n\nIn one text message shown to jurors, Davidson told Enquirer editor Dylan Howard that \"they are asking me to go back for another 25,\" meaning another $25,000. Howard responds with an expletive, adding, \"Not my money. I'll ask.\"\n\nBut even as they reached a basic framework for the deal, Davidson described his \"growing frustration with the process.\" At one point, Davidson said he was pushed to call Donald Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen directly, something he said he had been trying to avoid.\n\n\"I thought it was odd, certainly,\" Davidson said about being asked to call Cohen. \"I didn't particularly like dealing with him and that's why I was trying like hell to avoid talking to him,\" he added.\n\nDavidson testified that he understood McDougal's story would never be published and acknowledged that \"there was an unspoken understanding that there was an affiliation between David Pecker and Donald Trump and that AMI wouldn't run this story, any story related to Karen, because it would hurt Donald Trump.\"\n\nTRUMP'S ONLINE POSTS FOUND TO VIOLATE GAG ORDER HAVE BEEN REMOVED\n\nDonald Trump's online posts that on Tuesday were found to violate a gag order barring him from speaking publicly about jurors and witnesses in his criminal hush money trial were removed ahead of an afternoon deadline.\n\nThe posts in question were deleted while the court was in recess for lunch.\n\nLinks to the old Truth Social posts redirected to a \"Not found\" message, while those on Trump's website redirected to a 404 error page.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Judge Juan M. Merchan fined the former president $9,000 for the nine posts for violating the order.\n\nTEXAS AG PAXTON AMONG THOSE IN COURTROOM AS TRUMP'S TRIAL RESUMES\n\nCourt in Donald Trump's criminal trial resumed Tuesday after an early afternoon lunch break.\n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton walked into the courtroom with Trump and his entourage after posting on social media earlier in the day that he was there to support the former president. The Republican sat down in the first row of the courtroom gallery directly behind the defense table.\n\nPaxton sat just a few seats away from Trump's son Eric, who sat near the aisle alongside Susie Wiles, a Trump political operative.\n\nKeith Davidson, a lawyer who previously represented former Playboy model Karen McDougal and porn actor Stormy Daniels in hush money negotiations, was expected to returned to the witness stand.\n\nDAVIDSON SHEDS LIGHT ON SEQUENCE OF EVENTS THAT LED TO THE DEAL WITH THE ENQUIRER\n\nKeith Davidson testified Tuesday that after tipping off a National Enquirer editor about \"a blockbuster Trump story,\" he soon arranged a meeting with that editor, former Playboy model Karen McDougal and others to see whether the Enquirer's then-parent company was interested.\n\nAfter flying back to New York, Howard told him the Enquirer wasn't keen \"because Karen McDougal lacked documentary evidence of the interaction,\" Davidson testified.\n\nMcDougal had alleged that she had a year-long affair with Donald Trump years earlier.\n\nA month later, Enquirer editor Dylan Howard reached out again to Davidson, suggesting they resume discussions.\n\nAt the time, Davidson warned that the Enquirer's parent company would need to move quickly, writing in one text: \"Time is of the essence. The girl is being cornered by the estrogen mafia\"\n\nDavidson testified that McDougal was \"teetering\" at the time he sent the message and on the verge of signing a deal to tell her story to ABC News.\n\nDavidson also testified that he played the National Enquirer and ABC News against each other to get the best deal for his client. McDougal didn't want to tell her story publicly, which would've been required if she went to ABC, he said.\n\nJURY SEES TEXTS FROM LAWYER PROMISING TABLOID EDITOR A 'BLOCKBUSTER TRUMP STORY'\n\nIn his court testimony on Tuesday, attorney Keith Davidson described representing Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model, in her allegations of a year-long affair with Donald Trump.\n\nAs questioning turned toward Davidson's involvement in some of the hush money deals at the heart of the former president's criminal trial, he said he met McDougal 25 years ago through a friend. He said he started representing in 2016 \"to provide advice and counsel as to what her rights and obligations would be regarding a personal interaction that she had.\"\n\n\"With whom?\" prosecutor Joshua Steinglass asked.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"Donald Trump.\"\n\nShortly after Davidson began representing McDougal, he said, he reached out to Dylan Howard, the editor in chief of the National Enquirer, promising a \"blockbuster Trump story.\"\n\nHoward replied soon after: \"I will get you more than ANYONE for it. You know why.\"\n\nAs the text messages were displayed on screens to the jury, Davidson testified that he didn't know exactly what Howard meant at the time. But, he noted, \"I knew that Dylan's boss David Pecker and Mr. Trump were longtime friends and had a former business relationship,\" he said, adding the tabloid had effectively \"endorsed Mr. Trump's candidacy.\"\n\nSTORMY DANIELS' FORMER LAWYER CALLED TO THE STAND\n\nA lawyer who previously represented former Playboy model Karen McDougal and porn actor Stormy Daniels was the next witness called to the stand in Donald Trump's hush money trial.\n\nKeith Davidson took the stand shortly after noon Tuesday and is known for representing people trying to sell celebrity sex tapes or other embarrassing information.\n\nHe represented McDougal and Daniels in hush money negotiations with the National Enquirer and Trump's then-lawyer Michael Cohen in 2016.\n\nMcDougal claimed she had had a yearlong affair with Trump in the mid-2000s. Daniels claimed she had a one-time sexual encounter with him in 2006. Trump has denied both allegations.\n\nEXECUTIVE CALLED TO THE STAND TO VERIFY TRANSCRIPT, VIDEO OF TRUMP DEPOSITION\n\nAn executive at a company that provides stenographers and videographers for depositions -- sworn, out-of-court statements under oath -- was the next witness called to the stand in Donald Trump's criminal trial on Tuesday.\n\nPhillip Thompson was called to authenticate a transcript and video of a deposition the former president gave in one of writer E. Jean Carroll's federal defamation lawsuits against him.\n\nThe portions included Carroll's lawyer asking Trump about his Truth Social platform, the dates of his marriage to wife Melania Trump and whether he was aware of the \"Access Hollywood\" tape.\n\nThe former longtime Elle magazine advice columnist had alleged that Trump sexually assaulted her in the 1990s and then defamed her after she came forward publicly in 2019. He has said nothing happened between the two of them and called her a \"wack job\" who engineered a \"hoax\" to sell a book.\n\nAfter two federal trials last year and this winter, juries awarded Carroll over $88 million. Trump is appealing.\n\nVIDEOS OF TRUMP DENYING ALLEGATIONS AND PRAISING COHEN PLAYED IN COURT\n\nProsecutors in Donald Trump's hush money case played C-SPAN clips on Tuesday of the then-presidential candidate on the campaign trail in the final weeks leading up to the 2016 election. In the videos, Trump forcefully denied allegations made by several women after his infamous 2005 \"Access Hollywood\" tape was made public.\n\n\"The stories are total fiction. They're 100% made up, they never happened, they never would happen,\" Trump said in video from an Oct. 14, 2016 rally in North Carolina.\n\nAnother clip played for the jury, from January 2017, showed Trump praising Michael Cohen as as good lawyer and friend.\n\nTrump did not appear to react in court to the clips, which were played on monitors throughout the courtroom, including directly in front of him on the defense table.\n\nAfter confirming the veracity of the clips, Robert Browning -- the executive director of C-SPAN's archives -- was dismissed from the witness stand. Trump's attorneys declined to question him.\n\nEXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF C-SPAN ARCHIVES CALLED TO THE STAND\n\nThe next witness called to the stand Tuesday in Donald Trump's hush money trial was Robert Browning, the executive director of the C-SPAN archives.\n\nBrowning, who manages the network's video collection, was called to verify the authenticity of video of a Trump campaign event.\n\nProsecutors are calling people who are regarded as \"records custodians\" to verify evidence in the former president's criminal case.\n\nTRIAL WILL BREAK FOR 4 DAYS OVER MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND\n\nDonald Trump's hush money trial will get an extra day off for the Memorial Day weekend next month.\n\nCourt won't be in session on Friday, May 24, to accommodate a juror who has a flight that morning, Judge Juan M. Merchan said on Tuesday.\n\nThat means the trial will be off for four straight days for the holiday weekend, resuming on Tuesday, May 28. Merchan also informed jurors there will not be court on May 17, though he didn't give them a reason.\n\nThat's the day Donald Trump will be attending his son Barron's high school graduation.\n\nPROSECUTORS WANT TO QUESTION TRUMP ABOUT GAG ORDER VIOLATIONS IF HE TESTIFIES\n\nAhead of a midday break in Donald Trump's hush money case, prosecutors asked the judge to let them question the former president about his gag order violations should he choose to testify.\n\nThe request came after Judge Juan M. Merchan ruled Tuesday morning that Trump had on nine occasions violated a court mandate barring him from speaking publicly about witnesses and jurors in the case. He ultimately fined Trump $9,000 and will hold another hearing Thursday on four more alleged gag order violations.\n\nProsecutors also requested permission to introduce evidence they said shows Trump orchestrated a \"pressure campaign and intimidation effort\" against Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels.\n\nColangelo said Trump's attorney opened the door to that evidence by seeking to undermine the credibility of the two witnesses in opening statements.\n\nMerchan did not immediately rule, but said, \"the door has been opened.\"\n\nHe previously ruled to allow prosecutors to challenge Trump's credibility by questioning him about a limited number of his recent legal setbacks if he ends up taking the witness stand.\n\nTrump has said he wants to testify, but is under no obligation to do so.\n\nNO RED FLAGS ABOUT COHEN'S ACCOUNTS AT THE TIME, FARRO SAYS\n\nIn his cross examination of banker Gary Farro on Tuesday, defense attorney Todd Blanche underscored that Michael Cohen made no mention that the accounts he opened in October 2016 had anything to do with deals involving then-presidential candidate Donald Trump or his company.\n\nIf Cohen had done so, \"I would have asked questions,\" Farro said.\n\nFarro noted that he might not have opened a bank account for Cohen if he'd been told it was for what's known as a shell corporation -- one that receives and sends out money but doesn't have an underlying business.\n\nBut Cohen, the banker said, told him the account was for a real estate consulting business.\n\nNothing about it raised \"any red flags to you?\" Blanche asked.\n\n\"Not based upon the answers I was given to the questions I asked,\" Farro said.\n\nFarro's testimony shed light on his role in helping Cohen open a bank account that was later used to process a $130,000 wire transfer to a lawyer for Stormy Daniels.\n\nDEFENSE BEGINS CROSS-EXAMINATION OF FARRO\n\nDefense attorneys began their cross-examination of Gary Farro, the prosecution's third witness in Donald Trump's hush money trial, by asking the banker to describe his relationship with Michael Cohen.\n\nFarro said he first met Cohen -- then serving as the former president's personal lawyer -- in person at a meeting in Trump Tower, but primarily communicated over the phone. Pushed by Todd Blanche, Farro acknowledged that Cohen wasn't always easy to work with.\n\n\"He was a challenging client because of his desire to get things done so quickly,\" Farro said. \"Ninety percent of the time it was an urgent matter.\"\n\nPROSECUTORS WRAP QUESTIONING OF FARRO\n\nProsecutors have wrapped up questioning of Gary Farro, their third witness in Donald Trump's criminal hush money trial.\n\nFarro told prosecutors on Tuesday that Michael Cohen had indicated that a 2016 $130,000 wire payment now at the heart of the case was related to a real estate transaction -- not a political candidate, an adult film performer or buying up a potential media story.\n\n\"We might consider something like that a reputational risk,\" Farro said.\n\nWithin a day of opening the Essential Consultants LLC bank account on Oct. 26, 2016 -- and funding it with about $130,000 from his own home equity loan -- Cohen wired out $130,000 to Keith Davidson, then a lawyer for Stormy Daniels, documents showed.\n\nThe 2016 presidential election was on Nov. 8.\n\nFAMILY JOINS TRUMP IN COURT FOR THE FIRST TIME\n\nDonald Trump's son Eric joined his father in court on Tuesday, marking the first time any of the former president's family members have attended his criminal hush money trial.\n\nPrior to court proceedings resuming, Trump turned from the defense table and walked over to his son in the first row of the gallery. Trump put his hand on Eric's arm as they chatted.\n\nTrump had railed about the trial, as well as his other legal cases, to reporters on his way into the courtroom earlier in the morning.\n\nFARRO RETURNS TO THE STAND\n\nTestimony in Donald Trump's hush money trial resumed with Gary Farro, a banker who helped Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen open accounts. Cohen used one such account to buy the silence of porn performer Stormy Daniels in the weeks before the 2016 election. She alleged a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump, which he denies.\n\nCohen indicated the account, opened in late October 2016 in the name of Essential Consultants LLC, would be used for real estate consulting, according to testimony and documents shown at the trial.\n\nIn response to prosecutor Becky Mangold's questions, Farro said the bank would have asked more questions if there had been any mention of a connection to a political candidate, buying a story that was being pitched to the media or paying a porn performer.\n\nThe additional scrutiny would have delayed or even nixed opening the account, which Cohen had wanted to open right away. In particular, the adult film world \"is an industry we don't work with,\" he said.\n\nWith only real estate in the picture, the account was opened within a day -- \"very quick,\" Farro said.\n\nMERCHAN FINDS POST ABOUT COHEN AND DANIELS WAS NOT A VIOLATION\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan found that one of Donald Trump's online posts about his former lawyer Michael Cohen and porn actor Stormy Daniels did not violate a gag order barring him from speaking publicly about jurors and witnesses in his hush money case.\n\nMerchan wrote that he was finding Trump \"in criminal contempt for willfully disobeying a lawful mandate\" of the court on nine separate occasions for posts made on Truth Social and his campaign website.\n\nMerchan ruled that Trump's April 10 post referring to Cohen and Daniels as \"sleaze bags\" was not a gag order violation. He said Trump's contention that he was responding to previous posts by Cohen \"is sufficient to give\" him pause \"as to whether the People have met their burden\" as to that post.\n\nHowever, the other nine \"attack the credibility of arguably two of the more high-profile witnesses in this case.\"\n\n\"To allow such attacks upon protected witnesses with blanket assertions that they are all responses to 'political attacks' would be an exception that swallowed the rule. The Expanded Order does not contain such an exception,\" Merchan wrote.\n\nJUDGE FINDS TRUMP VIOLATED GAG ORDER, FINES HIM $9K\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan ruled Tuesday morning that Donald Trump violated a gag order barring him from making public statements about witnesses and jurors in his hush money trial nine times. He fined the former president $9,000 for the violations.\n\nProsecutors had alleged the former president had violated the order 10 times, and Merchan concurred in all but one of those instances. The judge will hold a hearing Thursday on four more alleged violations.\n\nThe former president stared down at the table in front of him as Merchan read the ruling, frowning slightly but otherwise showing no expression.\n\nMerchan wrote in his ruling that Trump \"is hereby warned that the Court will not tolerate continued willful violations of its lawful orders\" and raised the possibility of jail time if \"necessary and appropriate under the circumstances.\"\n\nJUDGE TO ALLOW TRUMP TO ATTEND SON'S GRADUATION\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan said Tuesday morning that Donald Trump's criminal hush money trial will not be held on May 17 so that the former president can attend his son's graduation.\n\n\"I don't think the May 17 date is a problem, so Mr. Trump can certainly attend that date, attend his son's graduation,\" Merchan said.\n\nTrump had previously requested the day off from court to accommodate his son Barron's high school graduation.\n\nTRUMP ARRIVES AT COURT\n\nDonald Trump's motorcade arrived Tuesday morning at the courthouse in lower Manhattan just before 9 a.m., kicking off the second week of witness testimony in the former president's hush money trial.\n\nA crowd of around 60 Trump supporters had gathered across the street from the building, waving Trump and American flags on tall poles.\n\nTRUMP LEAVES TRUMP TOWER FOR COURT\n\nDonald Trump entered his motorcade outside Trump Tower in midtown, headed to the courthouse in lower Manhattan for the second week of trial testimony.\n\nThe former president on Tuesday will be in court for testimony from the third prosecution witness, Gary Farro, a banker who helped Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen open accounts.\n\nCohen used one to buy the silence of porn performer Stormy Daniels. She alleged a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump, which he denies.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

All you have to do is invent something brilliant (like, say, the iPad), then sit back and wait for the checks to roll in. But when you grow up you learn about capitalism and investors and stock prices and realize that everything is a lot more complicated. One-off brilliance is not enough -- you need an ongoing revenue stream, and that means releasing new things on a regular basis, each preferably better than the last.\n\nFinding ways to make the iPad better every 18 months (but not so good that you can't surpass it again next time) is tricky enough, but Apple made another rod for its own back when it split the device into multiple lines: the standard iPad, the iPad mini, the iPad Air, the iPad Pro. Now you have to make sure the iPad is better than last year's model, the iPad Air is better than the iPad, and the Pro is better than the Air... but not so much better that the weaker product doesn't get any sales at all. The whole thing is an unenviable juggling act, equal parts innovation, compromise, and planned obsolescence.\n\nThanks to its inconsistent naming conventions, confusing technical differences, and intimidating range of sizes and storage capacities, Apple's iPad range has long been a nightmare for the casual buyer. But at least, up to now, the headache has been confined to the tablet range. That may soon change if we can believe a surprising new report that says the iPad Pro is about to jump from the M2 to the M4 processor. Bump the Pro to an M4 and Mac customers are going to be just as confused as...",

        "text": "Did Apple just help China retaliate against America's possible TikTok ban?\n\nApple has long invested heavily in Chinese markets, and, based on a recent report, the company is willing to exercise censorship to maintain those markets. Bloomberg reportedon April 18 that Apple Inc. had removed at least four social media services from its Chinese App Store, including two Meta-owned apps. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which Bloomberg called \"one of the world's most rigid internet censorship regimes,\" demanded that Apple remove the apps over alleged \"national security\" concerns. Apple complied just after President Joe Biden signed a bill forcing TikTok to either relinquish its Chinese communist government ties or leave the country. The process of both bans have been ongoing, however.\n\nBloomberg explained, \"The orders come on the heels of a cleanup program Chinese regulators initiated in 2023 that was expected to remove many defunct or unregistered apps from domestic iOS and Android stores.\" Mobile app developers were reportedly required to complete registration with the CCP by the end of March or be forced to cease operating. The censored apps are Meta's Threads and WhatsApp, along with Signal and Telegram.\n\nIn a statement obtained by Bloomberg, Apple claimed that it disagreed with the CCP's demands but had to follow them. \"We are obligated to follow the laws in the countries where we operate, even when we disagree. The Cyberspace Administration of China ordered the removal of these apps from the China storefront based on their national security concerns,\" Apple stated, per Bloomberg. \"These apps remain available for download on all other storefronts where they appear.\"\n\nThe dictatorial CCP's \"Great Firewall\" has long banned foreign social media apps, including Facebook and Twitter (now X). Asia-Pacific news site The Diplomat, noted that Chinese users can be sentenced to years in prison for criticizing CCP officials.\n\nAmerican companies' operations in Communist China continue to be controversial, as do the operations of Chinese companies in America. President Joe Biden signed a bill a week ago that gives TikTok's Chinese parent company ByteDance a choice between selling TikTok or having the popular app banned. The CCP owns a board seat and maintains a financial stake in ByteDance, and multiple reports claim Chinese employees have access to U.S. TikTok user data, raising national security concerns.",

(AP) -- Pennsylvania took a step Tuesday toward becoming the latest state to punish someone for using a Bluetooth-connected device to track someone without their permission.\n\nThe state House of Representatives voted 199-1 to approve legislation that would make using a tracking device to secretly track another person part of Pennsylvania's laws against stalking. The crime would be punishable as a third-degree misdemeanor, or up to 90 days in jail.\n\nThe bill goes to the Senate, where a separate bill is pending that would make the crime a second-degree misdemeanor, or punishable by up to two years in jail.\n\nMost states have a provision in state law that prohibits remote tracking, while others are adding it. Ohio is considering such legislation, Florida is increasing penalties for using such a device and Kentucky approved a new law last year.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Prosecutors say Trump obscured the true nature of those payments and falsely recorded them as legal expenses.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.\n\nThe case is the first-ever criminal trial of a former U.S. president and the first of four prosecutions of Trump to reach a jury.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- Key players: Who's who at Donald Trump's hush money criminal trial\n\n-- The hush money case is just one of Trump's legal cases. See the others here\n\n-- Read the judge's full order on Donald Trump's gag order violations\n\n-- Trump and DeSantis meet to make peace and discuss fundraising for the former president's campaign\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nTRUMP HITS OUT AT GAG ORDER AS COURT ADJOURNS FOR THE DAY\n\nDonald Trump complained about the gag order in his hush money trial, as well as other things as he left the courthouse Tuesday following the adjournment of the day's proceedings.\n\nThe former president approached news cameras in the courthouse hallway on his way out and hit on familiar themes, including accusing Judge Juan M. Merchan of bias and of rushing the case, and also saying he should be out campaigning.\n\nTrump was found in contempt of court earlier in the day and fined $9,000 for nine violations of the gag order, which bars him from speaking publicly about witnesses and jurors in the case.\n\nDAVIDSON SAYS HE THOUGHT DANIELS' STORY WOULD 'BE A TORNADO' IF IT GOT OUT\n\nKeith Davidson and Dylan Howard, then-editor of the National Enquirer, texted each other about what Howard called an \"impending storm\" of publicity if Stormy Daniels took her story elsewhere after Michael Cohen failed to make a payment in the deal on time, according to Davidson's testimony and documents shown at the trial on Tuesday.\n\nDavidson wrote to Howard that he believed Daniels and her agent had agreed to bring her story about a sexual encounter with Donald Trump to another publication, and \"I think it'll be a full-on blitz.\"\n\n\"I just felt like there was going to be more than a flurry of activity. I felt like it was going to be a tornado,\" Davidson explained in court.\n\n\"If the story got out,\" Steinglass asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Davidson said.\n\nAsked if Cohen ever told him who he was representing in the Daniels negotiations, Davidson said that he may not have explicitly stated he was working on Trump's behalf -- but the implication was clear.\n\nCOHEN MISSED DEADLINE TO PAY $130K TO STORMY DANIELS, DAVIDSON SAYS\n\nBefore a brief afternoon break in Donald Trump's hush money trial, lawyer Keith Davidson testified Tuesday that Michael Cohen missed an agreed upon deadline for sending a $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels.\n\nAt first, Cohen offered a litany of explanations for the delay, at turns blaming broken computers, Secret Service \"firewalls,\" and the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur. \"The things he was saying didn't really make sense,\" Davidson said of Cohen.\n\nAs the excuses piled up, Davidson said he understood that Cohen \"didn't have the authority to actually spend money.\" He eventually sent an email informing Cohen that the deal involving Daniel's story about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump was off.\n\n\"I thought he was trying to kick the can down the round until after the election,\" Davidson said.\n\nAPPELLATE COURT REJECTS TRUMP'S REQUEST TO STAY HUSH MONEY TRIAL\n\nAs testimony continued in Donald Trump's hush money trial on Tuesday, a five-judge panel in New York state's mid-level appellate court rejected the former president's request for a stay of the proceedings while he appeals several pretrial rulings, including the trial judge's refusal to recuse himself.\n\nTrump had sought the stay prior to the start of jury selection. A lone judge in the appeals court had previously rejected a request for an emergency stay halting the trial.\n\nPSEUDONYMS WERE USED TO DISGUISE PARTIES INVOLVED IN ENQUIRER DEAL, LAWYER TESTIFIES\n\nIn drawing up the deal with the National Enquirer involving Stormy Daniels' story about an alleged sexual encounter with Donald Trump, Keith Davidson testified Tuesday that he used pseudonyms to disguise the parties involved.\n\nStormy Daniels became Peggy Peterson and Donald Trump became David Dennison, according to Davidson.\n\nThe alliterative code names were picked, in part, because Daniels was the plaintiff and Trump was the defendant, the lawyer testified.\n\nAsked by prosecutors in Trump's hush money case if David Dennison was a real person, Davidson said that he played on his high school hockey team.\n\n\"And how does he feel about you now?\" asked prosecutor Josh Steinglass.\n\nDavidson stifled a laugh, then answered: \"He's very upset.\"\n\n'MICHAEL COHEN STEPPED INTO AMI'S SHOES,' DAVIDSON SAYS\n\nStormy Daniels' agent reached a six-figure deal with then-National Enquirer editor Dylan Howard for the tabloid to acquire the rights to her story about a sexual encounter with Donald Trump after his \"Access Hollywood\" tape leaked, Keith Davidson testified Tuesday.\n\nBut then, according to Davidson, Howard backed out.\n\nThe editor instead told Daniels' agent, Gina Rodriguez, to call Michael Cohen and complete the deal directly with him -- but she refused to speak with Cohen after an uncomfortable prior interaction.\n\nRodriguez asked Davidson to step in and negotiate the deal with Cohen, the lawyer testified.\n\nDavidson added that he had numerous interactions with Howard over the years regarding stories. Asked if it was unusual for Howard to direct him to make a deal with a third party like Cohen, Davidson responded: \"This is the only time that ever happened.\"\n\n\"In essence, Michael Cohen stepped into AMI's shoes,\" Davidson said, referring to the name of the Enquirer's parent company at the time, American Media Inc.\n\nDavidson testified that in negotiating with Cohen, he hiked the price to $130,000 -- building in his fee for his work on the deal.\n\n'ACCESS HOLLYWOOD' TAPE LEAK MADE DANIELS' STORY MORE MARKETABLE, LAWYER SAYS\n\nStormy Daniels' story about a sexual encounter with Donald Trump became more marketable after the notorious \"Access Hollywood\" tape was leaked, Keith Davidson testified on Tuesday.\n\nDavidson, who previously represented Daniels, told prosecutors that Daniels' agent, Gina Rodriguez, had been trying to drum up interest in her story earlier in the 2016 election cycle but found there wasn't much.\n\nAsked to describe the \"Access Hollywood\" tape, which can't be shown in court, Davidson testified that it involved Trump and the show's then-host Billy Bush being recorded on a \"hot mic\" and \"some statements by both men that were troublesome.\"\n\n'HE WAS JUST SCREAMING,' LAWYER TESTIFIES OF FIRST INTERACTION WITH COHEN\n\nKeith Davidson on Tuesday testified that his first interaction with Michael Cohen related to a 2011 post on a gossip blog that stated that porn actor Stormy Daniels and Trump had \"some sort of physical or romantic interaction.\"\n\nAfter the blog post was published, Davidson said, Daniels' agent Gina Rodriguez called him and said, \"some jerk called me and was very, very aggressive and threatened to sue me.\"\n\nAsked who the \"jerk\" was, Davidson said: \"Michael Cohen.\"\n\nDavidson testified that when he called Cohen, the ex-Trump lawyer greeted him \"with a hostile barrage of insults and insinuations that went on for quite a while.\"\n\n\"I don't think he was accusing us of anything, he was just screaming,\" Davidson continued. \"Finally, after he finished, I explained to him that I was calling because my client, Stormy Daniels, did not want the story up. I wanted to see if he had done anything\" to try to get the story taken down.\n\nDavidson said he eventually sent a cease-and-desist letter to the blog after the dust up with Cohen and the story was removed.\n\nDAVIDSON SAYS HE UNDERSTOOD THE ENQUIRER WOULD NEVER PUBLISH MCDOUGAL'S STORY\n\nLawyer Keith Davidson testified on Tuesday that back-and-forth haggling took place in the selling of former Playboy model Karen McDougal's story to the National Enquirer.\n\nIn one text message shown to jurors, Davidson told Enquirer editor Dylan Howard that \"they are asking me to go back for another 25,\" meaning another $25,000. Howard responds with an expletive, adding, \"Not my money. I'll ask.\"\n\nBut even as they reached a basic framework for the deal, Davidson described his \"growing frustration with the process.\" At one point, Davidson said he was pushed to call Donald Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen directly, something he said he had been trying to avoid.\n\n\"I thought it was odd, certainly,\" Davidson said about being asked to call Cohen. \"I didn't particularly like dealing with him and that's why I was trying like hell to avoid talking to him,\" he added.\n\nDavidson testified that he understood McDougal's story would never be published and acknowledged that \"there was an unspoken understanding that there was an affiliation between David Pecker and Donald Trump and that AMI wouldn't run this story, any story related to Karen, because it would hurt Donald Trump.\"\n\nTRUMP'S ONLINE POSTS FOUND TO VIOLATE GAG ORDER HAVE BEEN REMOVED\n\nDonald Trump's online posts that on Tuesday were found to violate a gag order barring him from speaking publicly about jurors and witnesses in his criminal hush money trial were removed ahead of an afternoon deadline.\n\nThe posts in question were deleted while the court was in recess for lunch.\n\nLinks to the old Truth Social posts redirected to a \"Not found\" message, while those on Trump's website redirected to a 404 error page.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Judge Juan M. Merchan fined the former president $9,000 for the nine posts for violating the order.\n\nTEXAS AG PAXTON AMONG THOSE IN COURTROOM AS TRUMP'S TRIAL RESUMES\n\nCourt in Donald Trump's criminal trial resumed Tuesday after an early afternoon lunch break.\n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton walked into the courtroom with Trump and his entourage after posting on social media earlier in the day that he was there to support the former president. The Republican sat down in the first row of the courtroom gallery directly behind the defense table.\n\nPaxton sat just a few seats away from Trump's son Eric, who sat near the aisle alongside Susie Wiles, a Trump political operative.\n\nKeith Davidson, a lawyer who previously represented former Playboy model Karen McDougal and porn actor Stormy Daniels in hush money negotiations, was expected to returned to the witness stand.\n\nDAVIDSON SHEDS LIGHT ON SEQUENCE OF EVENTS THAT LED TO THE DEAL WITH THE ENQUIRER\n\nKeith Davidson testified Tuesday that after tipping off a National Enquirer editor about \"a blockbuster Trump story,\" he soon arranged a meeting with that editor, former Playboy model Karen McDougal and others to see whether the Enquirer's then-parent company was interested.\n\nAfter flying back to New York, Howard told him the Enquirer wasn't keen \"because Karen McDougal lacked documentary evidence of the interaction,\" Davidson testified.\n\nMcDougal had alleged that she had a year-long affair with Donald Trump years earlier.\n\nA month later, Enquirer editor Dylan Howard reached out again to Davidson, suggesting they resume discussions.\n\nAt the time, Davidson warned that the Enquirer's parent company would need to move quickly, writing in one text: \"Time is of the essence. The girl is being cornered by the estrogen mafia\"\n\nDavidson testified that McDougal was \"teetering\" at the time he sent the message and on the verge of signing a deal to tell her story to ABC News.\n\nDavidson also testified that he played the National Enquirer and ABC News against each other to get the best deal for his client. McDougal didn't want to tell her story publicly, which would've been required if she went to ABC, he said.\n\nJURY SEES TEXTS FROM LAWYER PROMISING TABLOID EDITOR A 'BLOCKBUSTER TRUMP STORY'\n\nIn his court testimony on Tuesday, attorney Keith Davidson described representing Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model, in her allegations of a year-long affair with Donald Trump.\n\nAs questioning turned toward Davidson's involvement in some of the hush money deals at the heart of the former president's criminal trial, he said he met McDougal 25 years ago through a friend. He said he started representing in 2016 \"to provide advice and counsel as to what her rights and obligations would be regarding a personal interaction that she had.\"\n\n\"With whom?\" prosecutor Joshua Steinglass asked.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"Donald Trump.\"\n\nShortly after Davidson began representing McDougal, he said, he reached out to Dylan Howard, the editor in chief of the National Enquirer, promising a \"blockbuster Trump story.\"\n\nHoward replied soon after: \"I will get you more than ANYONE for it. You know why.\"\n\nAs the text messages were displayed on screens to the jury, Davidson testified that he didn't know exactly what Howard meant at the time. But, he noted, \"I knew that Dylan's boss David Pecker and Mr. Trump were longtime friends and had a former business relationship,\" he said, adding the tabloid had effectively \"endorsed Mr. Trump's candidacy.\"\n\nSTORMY DANIELS' FORMER LAWYER CALLED TO THE STAND\n\nA lawyer who previously represented former Playboy model Karen McDougal and porn actor Stormy Daniels was the next witness called to the stand in Donald Trump's hush money trial.\n\nKeith Davidson took the stand shortly after noon Tuesday and is known for representing people trying to sell celebrity sex tapes or other embarrassing information.\n\nHe represented McDougal and Daniels in hush money negotiations with the National Enquirer and Trump's then-lawyer Michael Cohen in 2016.\n\nMcDougal claimed she had had a yearlong affair with Trump in the mid-2000s. Daniels claimed she had a one-time sexual encounter with him in 2006. Trump has denied both allegations.\n\nEXECUTIVE CALLED TO THE STAND TO VERIFY TRANSCRIPT, VIDEO OF TRUMP DEPOSITION\n\nAn executive at a company that provides stenographers and videographers for depositions -- sworn, out-of-court statements under oath -- was the next witness called to the stand in Donald Trump's criminal trial on Tuesday.\n\nPhillip Thompson was called to authenticate a transcript and video of a deposition the former president gave in one of writer E. Jean Carroll's federal defamation lawsuits against him.\n\nThe portions included Carroll's lawyer asking Trump about his Truth Social platform, the dates of his marriage to wife Melania Trump and whether he was aware of the \"Access Hollywood\" tape.\n\nThe former longtime Elle magazine advice columnist had alleged that Trump sexually assaulted her in the 1990s and then defamed her after she came forward publicly in 2019. He has said nothing happened between the two of them and called her a \"wack job\" who engineered a \"hoax\" to sell a book.\n\nAfter two federal trials last year and this winter, juries awarded Carroll over $88 million. Trump is appealing.\n\nVIDEOS OF TRUMP DENYING ALLEGATIONS AND PRAISING COHEN PLAYED IN COURT\n\nProsecutors in Donald Trump's hush money case played C-SPAN clips on Tuesday of the then-presidential candidate on the campaign trail in the final weeks leading up to the 2016 election. In the videos, Trump forcefully denied allegations made by several women after his infamous 2005 \"Access Hollywood\" tape was made public.\n\n\"The stories are total fiction. They're 100% made up, they never happened, they never would happen,\" Trump said in video from an Oct. 14, 2016 rally in North Carolina.\n\nAnother clip played for the jury, from January 2017, showed Trump praising Michael Cohen as as good lawyer and friend.\n\nTrump did not appear to react in court to the clips, which were played on monitors throughout the courtroom, including directly in front of him on the defense table.\n\nAfter confirming the veracity of the clips, Robert Browning -- the executive director of C-SPAN's archives -- was dismissed from the witness stand. Trump's attorneys declined to question him.\n\nEXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF C-SPAN ARCHIVES CALLED TO THE STAND\n\nThe next witness called to the stand Tuesday in Donald Trump's hush money trial was Robert Browning, the executive director of the C-SPAN archives.\n\nBrowning, who manages the network's video collection, was called to verify the authenticity of video of a Trump campaign event.\n\nProsecutors are calling people who are regarded as \"records custodians\" to verify evidence in the former president's criminal case.\n\nTRIAL WILL BREAK FOR 4 DAYS OVER MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND\n\nDonald Trump's hush money trial will get an extra day off for the Memorial Day weekend next month.\n\nCourt won't be in session on Friday, May 24, to accommodate a juror who has a flight that morning, Judge Juan M. Merchan said on Tuesday.\n\nThat means the trial will be off for four straight days for the holiday weekend, resuming on Tuesday, May 28. Merchan also informed jurors there will not be court on May 17, though he didn't give them a reason.\n\nThat's the day Donald Trump will be attending his son Barron's high school graduation.\n\nPROSECUTORS WANT TO QUESTION TRUMP ABOUT GAG ORDER VIOLATIONS IF HE TESTIFIES\n\nAhead of a midday break in Donald Trump's hush money case, prosecutors asked the judge to let them question the former president about his gag order violations should he choose to testify.\n\nThe request came after Judge Juan M. Merchan ruled Tuesday morning that Trump had on nine occasions violated a court mandate barring him from speaking publicly about witnesses and jurors in the case. He ultimately fined Trump $9,000 and will hold another hearing Thursday on four more alleged gag order violations.\n\nProsecutors also requested permission to introduce evidence they said shows Trump orchestrated a \"pressure campaign and intimidation effort\" against Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels.\n\nColangelo said Trump's attorney opened the door to that evidence by seeking to undermine the credibility of the two witnesses in opening statements.\n\nMerchan did not immediately rule, but said, \"the door has been opened.\"\n\nHe previously ruled to allow prosecutors to challenge Trump's credibility by questioning him about a limited number of his recent legal setbacks if he ends up taking the witness stand.\n\nTrump has said he wants to testify, but is under no obligation to do so.\n\nNO RED FLAGS ABOUT COHEN'S ACCOUNTS AT THE TIME, FARRO SAYS\n\nIn his cross examination of banker Gary Farro on Tuesday, defense attorney Todd Blanche underscored that Michael Cohen made no mention that the accounts he opened in October 2016 had anything to do with deals involving then-presidential candidate Donald Trump or his company.\n\nIf Cohen had done so, \"I would have asked questions,\" Farro said.\n\nFarro noted that he might not have opened a bank account for Cohen if he'd been told it was for what's known as a shell corporation -- one that receives and sends out money but doesn't have an underlying business.\n\nBut Cohen, the banker said, told him the account was for a real estate consulting business.\n\nNothing about it raised \"any red flags to you?\" Blanche asked.\n\n\"Not based upon the answers I was given to the questions I asked,\" Farro said.\n\nFarro's testimony shed light on his role in helping Cohen open a bank account that was later used to process a $130,000 wire transfer to a lawyer for Stormy Daniels.\n\nDEFENSE BEGINS CROSS-EXAMINATION OF FARRO\n\nDefense attorneys began their cross-examination of Gary Farro, the prosecution's third witness in Donald Trump's hush money trial, by asking the banker to describe his relationship with Michael Cohen.\n\nFarro said he first met Cohen -- then serving as the former president's personal lawyer -- in person at a meeting in Trump Tower, but primarily communicated over the phone. Pushed by Todd Blanche, Farro acknowledged that Cohen wasn't always easy to work with.\n\n\"He was a challenging client because of his desire to get things done so quickly,\" Farro said. \"Ninety percent of the time it was an urgent matter.\"\n\nPROSECUTORS WRAP QUESTIONING OF FARRO\n\nProsecutors have wrapped up questioning of Gary Farro, their third witness in Donald Trump's criminal hush money trial.\n\nFarro told prosecutors on Tuesday that Michael Cohen had indicated that a 2016 $130,000 wire payment now at the heart of the case was related to a real estate transaction -- not a political candidate, an adult film performer or buying up a potential media story.\n\n\"We might consider something like that a reputational risk,\" Farro said.\n\nWithin a day of opening the Essential Consultants LLC bank account on Oct. 26, 2016 -- and funding it with about $130,000 from his own home equity loan -- Cohen wired out $130,000 to Keith Davidson, then a lawyer for Stormy Daniels, documents showed.\n\nThe 2016 presidential election was on Nov. 8.\n\nFAMILY JOINS TRUMP IN COURT FOR THE FIRST TIME\n\nDonald Trump's son Eric joined his father in court on Tuesday, marking the first time any of the former president's family members have attended his criminal hush money trial.\n\nPrior to court proceedings resuming, Trump turned from the defense table and walked over to his son in the first row of the gallery. Trump put his hand on Eric's arm as they chatted.\n\nTrump had railed about the trial, as well as his other legal cases, to reporters on his way into the courtroom earlier in the morning.\n\nFARRO RETURNS TO THE STAND\n\nTestimony in Donald Trump's hush money trial resumed with Gary Farro, a banker who helped Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen open accounts. Cohen used one such account to buy the silence of porn performer Stormy Daniels in the weeks before the 2016 election. She alleged a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump, which he denies.\n\nCohen indicated the account, opened in late October 2016 in the name of Essential Consultants LLC, would be used for real estate consulting, according to testimony and documents shown at the trial.\n\nIn response to prosecutor Becky Mangold's questions, Farro said the bank would have asked more questions if there had been any mention of a connection to a political candidate, buying a story that was being pitched to the media or paying a porn performer.\n\nThe additional scrutiny would have delayed or even nixed opening the account, which Cohen had wanted to open right away. In particular, the adult film world \"is an industry we don't work with,\" he said.\n\nWith only real estate in the picture, the account was opened within a day -- \"very quick,\" Farro said.\n\nMERCHAN FINDS POST ABOUT COHEN AND DANIELS WAS NOT A VIOLATION\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan found that one of Donald Trump's online posts about his former lawyer Michael Cohen and porn actor Stormy Daniels did not violate a gag order barring him from speaking publicly about jurors and witnesses in his hush money case.\n\nMerchan wrote that he was finding Trump \"in criminal contempt for willfully disobeying a lawful mandate\" of the court on nine separate occasions for posts made on Truth Social and his campaign website.\n\nMerchan ruled that Trump's April 10 post referring to Cohen and Daniels as \"sleaze bags\" was not a gag order violation. He said Trump's contention that he was responding to previous posts by Cohen \"is sufficient to give\" him pause \"as to whether the People have met their burden\" as to that post.\n\nHowever, the other nine \"attack the credibility of arguably two of the more high-profile witnesses in this case.\"\n\n\"To allow such attacks upon protected witnesses with blanket assertions that they are all responses to 'political attacks' would be an exception that swallowed the rule. The Expanded Order does not contain such an exception,\" Merchan wrote.\n\nJUDGE FINDS TRUMP VIOLATED GAG ORDER, FINES HIM $9K\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan ruled Tuesday morning that Donald Trump violated a gag order barring him from making public statements about witnesses and jurors in his hush money trial nine times. He fined the former president $9,000 for the violations.\n\nProsecutors had alleged the former president had violated the order 10 times, and Merchan concurred in all but one of those instances. The judge will hold a hearing Thursday on four more alleged violations.\n\nThe former president stared down at the table in front of him as Merchan read the ruling, frowning slightly but otherwise showing no expression.\n\nMerchan wrote in his ruling that Trump \"is hereby warned that the Court will not tolerate continued willful violations of its lawful orders\" and raised the possibility of jail time if \"necessary and appropriate under the circumstances.\"\n\nJUDGE TO ALLOW TRUMP TO ATTEND SON'S GRADUATION\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan said Tuesday morning that Donald Trump's criminal hush money trial will not be held on May 17 so that the former president can attend his son's graduation.\n\n\"I don't think the May 17 date is a problem, so Mr. Trump can certainly attend that date, attend his son's graduation,\" Merchan said.\n\nTrump had previously requested the day off from court to accommodate his son Barron's high school graduation.\n\nTRUMP ARRIVES AT COURT\n\nDonald Trump's motorcade arrived Tuesday morning at the courthouse in lower Manhattan just before 9 a.m., kicking off the second week of witness testimony in the former president's hush money trial.\n\nA crowd of around 60 Trump supporters had gathered across the street from the building, waving Trump and American flags on tall poles.\n\nTRUMP LEAVES TRUMP TOWER FOR COURT\n\nDonald Trump entered his motorcade outside Trump Tower in midtown, headed to the courthouse in lower Manhattan for the second week of trial testimony.\n\nThe former president on Tuesday will be in court for testimony from the third prosecution witness, Gary Farro, a banker who helped Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen open accounts.\n\nCohen used one to buy the silence of porn performer Stormy Daniels. She alleged a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump, which he denies.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

        "text": "HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Pennsylvania took a step Tuesday toward becoming the latest state to punish someone for using a Bluetooth-connected device to track someone without their permission.\n\nThe state House of Representatives voted 199-1 to approve legislation that would make using a tracking device to secretly track another person part of Pennsylvania's laws against stalking. The crime would be punishable as a third-degree misdemeanor, or up to 90 days in jail.\n\nThe bill goes to the Senate, where a separate bill is pending that would make the crime a second-degree misdemeanor, or punishable by up to two years in jail.\n\nMost states have a provision in state law that prohibits remote tracking, while others are adding it. Ohio is considering such legislation, Florida is increasing penalties for using such a device and Kentucky approved a new law last year.\n\nBluetooth-controlled devices made by various tech giants or digital apps installed on a mobile phone can secretly track the movements of another person.\n\nThe House bill's passage Tuesday comes a few weeks after a federal judge denied Apple's motion to dismiss a class-action lawsuit contending that the tech giant hasn't done enough to prevent stalkers from using its AirTag devices to track victims.\n\nApple's $29 AirTags have become popular items since their 2021 release, helping users keep tabs on the location of anything from lost keys to wallets and luggage.\n\nBut stalkers have also taken advantage of AirTags and similar tracking devices, and dozens of plaintiffs sued Apple in 2022, contending that AirTag users had stalked them. They said its safety features are inadequate and that Apple should have done more to protect victims after AirTags \"revolutionized the scope, breadth, and ease of location-based stalking.\"\n\nApple has condemned any malicious use of the product. It argued in court that it \"took proactive steps\" to deter misuse and that it shouldn't be liable for damage caused by third parties.\n\nLast year, Apple partnered with Google to set standards for fighting secret surveillance with tracking devices.",

A new Repair State feature will keep Find My enabled throughout the repair process.\n\nCode referencing the feature was originally discovered by 9to5mac in the latest iOS 17.5 beta, which was released on Tuesday to authorized developers. The new feature aims make repairs easier for both consumers and repair technicians, by eliminating the requirement for Find My removal.\n\nBefore Repair State, requiring Find My to be disabled ensured that neither Apple nor an authorized service center ends up unknowingly working on a stolen iPhone\n\nWith iOS 17.3 Apple introduced a security delay as a part of Stolen Device Protection, which requires users to wait an extra hour before FindMy can be disabled when away from significant locations. It is a feature that prevents unauthorized users from changing the user's password or accessing critical data.\n\nDealing with said time delay will no longer be necessary with the new Repair State feature, but it appears to lack a critical component -- there is currently no way of disabling the feature in the beta.\n\nHowever, that may be a feature and not a bug. Apple may not have implemented an option to exit the Repair State except by authorized repair technicians.\n\niOS 17.5 remains a relatively minor update, as Apple is expected to announce its next generation of operating systems at WWDC on June 10.",

        "text": "Hulu's new limited series \"We Were the Lucky Ones\" tells the heartbreaking story of a Polish Jewish family split up during WWII. Some go into hiding and others are forced into concentration camps. It then charts their post-war journey as the family attempts to reunite. Adapted from Georgia Hunter's 2017 book of the same name, it's a tough watch but a vital one.\n\nIt is propelled to greatness thanks to wonderful performances from the extensive cast, led by Joey King as the youngest sibling, Halina who works as a lab assistant. Critics agree, King is in top form here.\n\nProma Khosla (Indie Wire) observed: \"King stuns as the young Halina becomes skilled at lying, adapting, and running. It's she who delivers one of the series' most potent lines, when Halina faces separation from husband Adam (Sam Woolf) in later episodes: 'I cannot bear not to know our children.'\"\n\nAaron Pruner (The Wrap) stated: \"As for standouts among the cast, King is the one to watch. She again proves herself as a powerhouse actress, delivering a knockout performance as Halina.\"\n\nRobert Daniels (Roger Ebert) opined: \"King, in a more mature role than in her hit 'Kissing Booth' franchise, is a notable highlight. She never plays the character's many tragedies too broad, retaining a difficult measure of grit and tenacity that rarely dims even as the odds grow bleak.\"\n\nAs a result, King could be in contention for a second Emmy nomination for Best TV Movie/Limited Series Actress despite some tough competition this year from Oscar-winners Jodie Foster (\"True Detective: Night Country\"), Brie Larson (\"Lessons in Chemistry\"), and Kate Winslet (\"The Regime\"). King contended in this category in 2019 for \"The Act,\" however, so we already know that Emmy voters like her specifically in this category. That's a big help.\n\nKing is also starring in a period drama, which is a great way for actresses to earn nominations in this category. Anya Taylor-Joy (\"The Queen's Gambit\"), Cynthia Erivo (\"Genius: Aretha\"), Cate Blanchett (\"Mrs. America\"), Michelle Williams (\"Fosse/Verdon\"), and Michelle Dockery (\"Godless\") all reaped bids for their leading roles in period dramas.\n\nPlus, \"We Were the Lucky Ones\" is actually based on Hunter's own ancestors so there is truth to this tale. True stories do well in this category, too, with the likes of Erivo, Blanchett, Williams, Jessica Chastain (\"George & Tammy\"), Sarah Paulson (\"Impeachment: American Crime Story\"), Lily James (\"Pam & Tommy\"), and Julia Garner (\"Inventing Anna\") all earning citations for performances in limited series telling true stories.\n\nKing is likely still in that \"afterglow\" phase, too, wherein her first Emmy nomination cemented her in the minds of voters and she has remained there since. Plenty of actresses have earned follow-up nominations soon after their first bids, such as Margaret Qualley (\"Fosse/Verdon\"/\"Maid\"), Kathryn Hahn (\"Transparent\"/\"WandaVision\"/\"Tiny Beautiful Things\"), and Kerry Washington (\"Scandal\"/\"Confirmation\"/\"Little Fires Everywhere\").\n\nKing is also a up-and-coming star. This profile of performer does well in this category, with similar nominees Taylor-Joy, James, Garner, Qualley, Riley Keough (\"Daisy Jones & the Six\"), Dominque Fishback (\"Swarm\"), and Lizzy Caplan (\"Fleishman is in Trouble\").\n\nMake your predictions at Gold Derby now.

        "text": "Looking for a helping hand in the market? Members of Cash Flow Club get exclusive ideas and guidance to navigate any climate. Learn More \"\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) reported strong first-quarter earnings results. The company beat estimates easily and margins improved nicely. While the Q2 revenue growth outlook was worse than expected, Amazon's performance is still appealing from an operational perspective. On the other hand, the stock is far from cheap today; thus, investors should consider AMZN's valuation before buying.\n\nI have covered Amazon.com, Inc. several times in the past, most recently last year when the company reported its Q1 2023 results. I gave the company a neutral rating back then, which has not been the best call -- AMZN has rallied substantially since then. Thus, a bullish call would have worked out better. My main reason to stay on the sidelines a year ago was Amazon.com's high valuation, but as it turned out, the stock performed nicely despite trading at a high valuation even a year ago. In today's article, I will focus on Amazon's Q1 2024 results and what they mean for the company going forward.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. reported its most recent earnings results, for its fiscal first quarter, on Tuesday afternoon. We can see the headline results in the following screencap:\n\nThe company was able to beat results on both lines, which naturally is a strong result. Revenue came in slightly higher than expected (around 0.5%) and was up by 13% year over year. Compared to the company's results in the last couple of quarters, that was very solid -- revenue growth came in between 7% and 15% over the last two years, thus growth in Q1 was above the average over that time frame.\n\nEarnings per share also were higher than expected and were up massively year over year, despite headwinds from the value decline of Amazon's stake in electric vehicle company Rivian Automotive (RIVN). Without that non-cash loss, Amazon would have reported even higher profits for the first quarter.\n\nThe market appreciated these results, sending Amazon's shares higher by a couple of percentage points at the time of writing. This could change in the coming days, of course, as investors digest the company's results and outlook.\n\nAmazon.com has been a huge company for many years, but its profits were not huge during the vast majority of those years, as we can easily see in the following chart:\n\nCompared to the hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue that Amazon has been generating for some time, its profits always looked rather meager. Companies such as Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) have been more profitable despite generating significantly lower revenues -- GOOG generated $74 billion of net profit in 2023 with around half of the revenue Amazon is generating.\n\nThis rather low profitability was partially due to Amazon's hefty investments in its operations, but the business model also plays a role. The retail business isn't very high-margin and not comparable to the businesses of Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet, or Meta Platforms (META), which all generate much higher margins with better operating leverage in their core business units. Amazon also was hurt hard by inflation in 2022 (and, to a lesser extent, in 2023), which we can see in the above chart -- profits nosedived during that time. High fuel costs and high shipping costs due to disruptions to global trade, for example, hurt Amazon a lot more compared to its big-tech peers, where transportation and fuel costs are not really impactful.\n\nThe good news is that profitability has been improving a lot at Amazon in the very recent past. This is partially due to easing inflation worries -- fuel expenses, for example, are down compared to the peak levels seen in 2022 and 2023. Shipping costs, such as Asia-to-North America container leasing rates, are also down a lot compared to the highs seen over the last couple of years.\n\nBut apart from a more benign macro picture, Amazon also benefitted from company-specific items. The company has been focused on bringing down expenses in the recent past, which includes job cuts. Amazon has not only done these over the last two years, but kept cutting employees in different units such as Audible, AWS, and also in its healthcare unit lately. The impact of these very recent job cuts should be fully visible in the coming quarters -- investors can count on further profitability improvements in the foreseeable future, all else equal.\n\nBetween revenue growth that allowed for some operating leverage, especially in the techy, higher-margin AWS segment, and Amazon's cost-cutting programs, the company saw its profits soar over the last year. Operating profit came in at $15.3 billion, up more than 200% from $4.8 billion one year earlier. Both in absolute terms and in relative terms, Amazon is still less profitable compared to companies such as Apple (AAPL) or Alphabet, but the profitability improvements over the last year are excellent.\n\nBased on the company's guidance for the current quarter, the company's fiscal Q2, profitability will remain at an appealing level in the near term. Amazon expects revenues of around $147 billion during the current quarter, which is slightly less than the analyst consensus estimate. But the profit outlook -- Amazon expects operating profits of around $12 billion -- is compelling. After all, this would represent a major improvement of well above 50% compared to the second quarter of 2023, when Amazon's operating profit was $7.7 billion.\n\nConsidering Amazon's guidance can be conservative at times, actual results for the current quarter may be better than what the company is guiding for right now. The company had guided for $141 billion in revenue for the first quarter, for example, but actual revenues came in more than $2 billion higher. Amazon also beat its Q1 operating profit guidance by a hefty $5 billion, as Amazon had guided for \"only\" $10 billion in operating profit for the first quarter.\n\nAmazon.com has a strong brand and an excellent market position. In its core markets, including North America, Amazon is the biggest and most dominant e-commerce player by far. While the retail business isn't growing at the rates it was growing at when Amazon was a smaller and younger company, growth is still appealing. Amazon also has a strong market position in cloud computing, although it is not among the AI leaders -- others, such as Microsoft or Nvidia (NVDA), offer more exposure in that area.\n\nAmazon's recent profitability growth is highly compelling, and with ongoing headcount reductions in some areas, Amazon could see further profitability tailwinds in the coming quarters.\n\nOn the other hand, waning inflation pressures and declining fuel and shipping costs were major profit drivers in the recent past. It is far from guaranteed that fuel and shipping costs will decline further, thus profit growth in the coming quarters could be weaker compared to what we have seen in the first quarter.\n\nAmazon has a healthy balance sheet, but it is not as strong as the balance sheets of Amazon's big tech peers. Amazon's $73 billion of cash and equivalents are mostly offset by $58 billion of long-term debt, while companies such as Meta or Alphabet have significantly larger net cash positions.\n\nAmazon's shareholder returns are also not as attractive as the shareholder return programs of Amazon's peers -- Amazon does not pay any dividends and its share count continues to climb, while other big-tech companies are mostly offering dividend payments and significant buybacks as well.\n\nFrom a valuation perspective, Amazon.com, Inc. stock looks rather pricey. Shares trade for 43x net profits today, although it is possible that the earnings per share consensus estimate will rise in the next couple of days as analysts adjust their models due to Amazon's better-than-expected profitability during the first quarter. But even if the consensus estimate rises slightly, Amazon would still trade at a significant premium compared to companies such as Alphabet, Meta, or Apple, which are trading with earnings multiples in the 20s. Alphabet and Meta also have stronger business growth compared to Amazon, making them look like more favorable investments, I believe.\n\nLooking at Amazon's valuation from a cash flow perspective, we see that the company generated free cash flows of $46 billion over the last twelve months, accounting for the repayment of finance leases. The company is valued at $1.9 trillion today, making for a free cash flow multiple of roughly 40. This makes for a free cash flow yield of around 2.5% at a time when treasuries and CDs are paying way more than 2.5%. We can thus conclude that plenty of future earnings and cash flow growth is baked into Amazon's stock price already.\n\nI do not believe that Amazon is way overvalued here, but I also do not believe that the current valuation is especially attractive. Other big tech names look more compelling to me, relative to Amazon, which is why I give this retail giant a neutral rating today.",

        "text": "Your versatile home gadget can help you get more qualities zzzs.\n\nBesides everything else your smart speaker can do -- from weather forecasts to fact checks to playing music -- it's also able to help improve your sleep. That might be by playing sounds to help you drift off, for example, or by waking you up gently in the morning.\n\nThe sleep-boosting tricks we're going to cover here can be used across smart speakers made by Amazon, Google, and Apple (as well as the smart displays) -- so there should be something here that fits your smart home setup.\n\nYour smart speaker can work as a noise machine if that helps you fall asleep -- and you can even choose between several different colors of noise. If static isn't for you, smart speakers can play a variety of natural sounds as well, so you can drift off to audio of a thunderstorm or the clack-clack of a train on tracks.\n\nGetting this setup is as simple as saying \"play white noise,\" \"play pink noise,\" or \"play the sounds of a thunderstorm\" to your smart speaker, though they all work in slightly different ways in terms of how they respond. An Amazon Echo will try and find a specific app to help, for example, while a Google Nest might load up a track from YouTube -- it really depends on what you've asked for.\n\nHead into the companion app on your phone -- so the Alexa app, the Google Home app, or the Home app for iOS -- to see what's currently playing and to set options such as a sleep timer. Most sounds can be configured to keep playing all night, or to turn themselves off after a specific amount of time has passed.\n\nAnother way that smart speakers can improve your sleep health is by giving you nudges to help you stick to a routine. Every smart speaker can set reminders, for instance: Just ask for a reminder to be read out at a certain time, when you know you need to start getting ready for some shut-eye.\n\nAt the other end of the day, you can set an alarm in the same way to get you out of bed. The available alarm sounds -- which can be set through the app that accompanies your smart speaker -- include a number of gentle and soothing options. If you're using a Google Nest smart display, meanwhile, in the alarm settings you can customize what's labeled a Pre-alarm sound to come before the alarm too.\n\nSmart speakers from Amazon, Google, and Apple can all trigger routines alongside an alarm, so you can have your smart lights gradually come on for example, or start a playlist specifically designed to get you out of bed without you having to resort to the snooze button (or a snooze voice command).\n\nIn the Alexa app, tap the + (plus) button in the top right corner of the Home tab, then choose Routine. Set the time you want the routine to start (it can start with the sunrise time in your part of the world, if you want), then choose what you want the Echo to do -- some of the options include playing specific sounds, starting a playlist, and reading out the news.\n\nIn the Google Home app, head to the Automations tab, then choose + Add to get started. The options match those available on the Echo speakers pretty closely: You can pick a specific time for the routine to start or have it synced with your local sunrise time, and you can pick from a variety of sounds and audio sources to listen to, as well as control connected smart devices (so you can get your smart lights to gradually brighten to give you a more gentle wake up, for example).\n\nIf you're using a HomePod, open the Home app for iOS, head to the Home tab, then tap the + (plus) button up in the top right corner. Choose Add Scene, then Custom, and you're ready to get started: As on the Amazon and Google speakers, your options include being able to gently turn on smart lights, and broadcasting a specific playlist.\n\nThere's lots more you can get your smart speaker to do to help you wind down for bed -- just think about all the different types of audio it can cue up. In addition to putting together a specially prepared playlist, you could also have an audiobook play while you're drowsy, or perhaps run through an audio meditation session.\n\nSometimes you'll be able to do this right on the speaker -- as with the Guided Meditations skill for the Amazon Echo -- and other times you'll need to manage the audio on your phone and simply have it stream through your smart speaker (it'll certainly sound better than it does on your phone), maybe through an app like Headspace or Calm.\n\nYou can connect to Echo speakers wirelessly via Bluetooth (just say \"Alexa, pair\" to get into pairing mode), to Nest speakers via Chromecast (tap the Chromecast button in the app you're using), and to HomePod speakers via AirPlay (tap the AirPlay logo in Control Center on your iPhone). All the necessary settings, including volume and sleep timers, can then be set on your phone before you drift off.",

        "text": "Business media got all excited about the quarterly results from Amazon, which were much better than expected. However, the outlook was weaker than expected for another quarter. As a result, the shares, which had fallen more than 3% in Tuesday's sell-off, could only manage a 2.9% gain in sparse after-hours dealings.\n\nThe online giant revealed better-than-expected earnings and revenue for the first quarter, driven by growth in advertising and cloud computing, and of course, by cost-cutting.\n\nAmazon has chopped off more than 27,000 employees since late 2022, with the cuts bleeding into 2024. During the first quarter, Amazon let go hundreds of staffers in its health and AWS businesses and made significant cuts in Prime TV, Prime itself, and other businesses.\n\nRevenue rose to $US143.3 billion, up 13% from $US127.4 billion a year ago, and operating income soared more than 200% to $US15.3 billion, far outpacing revenue growth. Investors said that was the big positive from the results and a solid sign that the company's cost-cutting measures in 2022 and 2023 are now bolstering its bottom line. The cloud business, AWS, though accounted for 62% of total operating profit. Net income also more than tripled to $10.4 billion, from $US3.17 billion. Amazon said it expects a continued jump in profitability for the current second quarter but at a more measured (slower) pace. The company said operating income will be $US10 billion to $US14 billion, up from $US7.7 billion a year earlier. Revenue in the current quarter will be $US144 billion to $US149 billion, or growth of 7% to 11%. Analysts were expecting growth of 12% to $US150.1 billion, which is why the forecast was seen as a bit weak.\n\nThe rebound at AWS stood out; Amazon said sales in the division surged 17% in the first quarter to $US25 billion, topping forecasts for sales growth of 12% to $US24.5 billion. For Amazon, it was a welcome return to sales growth for AWS after a sluggish year in 2023. Demand for cloud services is being driven by AI, according to the company.\n\nDespite media hints at a dividend re-release (joining the likes of Meta, Alphabet, and Apple among the megatechs in paying dividends), there was nothing from Amazon. Also, unlike other megatechs, there was no buyback news from Amazon in its results release.",

Merchan of bias and of rushing the case, and also saying he should be out campaigning.\n\nTrump was found in contempt of court earlier in the day and fined $9,000 for nine violations of the gag order, which bars him from speaking publicly about witnesses and jurors in the case.\n\nDAVIDSON SAYS HE THOUGHT DANIELS' STORY WOULD 'BE A TORNADO' IF IT GOT OUT\n\nKeith Davidson and Dylan Howard, then-editor of the National Enquirer, texted each other about what Howard called an \"impending storm\" of publicity if Stormy Daniels took her story elsewhere after Michael Cohen failed to make a payment in the deal on time, according to Davidson's testimony and documents shown at the trial on Tuesday.\n\nDavidson wrote to Howard that he believed Daniels and her agent had agreed to bring her story about a sexual encounter with Donald Trump to another publication, and \"I think it'll be a full-on blitz.\"\n\n\"I just felt like there was going to be more than a flurry of activity. I felt like it was going to be a tornado,\" Davidson explained in court.\n\n\"If the story got out,\" Steinglass asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Davidson said.\n\nAsked if Cohen ever told him who he was representing in the Daniels negotiations, Davidson said that he may not have explicitly stated he was working on Trump's behalf -- but the implication was clear.\n\nCOHEN MISSED DEADLINE TO PAY $130K TO STORMY DANIELS, DAVIDSON SAYS\n\nBefore a brief afternoon break in Donald Trump's hush money trial, lawyer Keith Davidson testified Tuesday that Michael Cohen missed an agreed upon deadline for sending a $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels.\n\nAt first, Cohen offered a litany of explanations for the delay, at turns blaming broken computers, Secret Service \"firewalls,\" and the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur. \"The things he was saying didn't really make sense,\" Davidson said of Cohen.\n\nAs the excuses piled up, Davidson said he understood that Cohen \"didn't have the authority to actually spend money.\" He eventually sent an email informing Cohen that the deal involving Daniel's story about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump was off.\n\n\"I thought he was trying to kick the can down the round until after the election,\" Davidson said.\n\nAPPELLATE COURT REJECTS TRUMP'S REQUEST TO STAY HUSH MONEY TRIAL\n\nAs testimony continued in Donald Trump's hush money trial on Tuesday, a five-judge panel in New York state's mid-level appellate court rejected the former president's request for a stay of the proceedings while he appeals several pretrial rulings, including the trial judge's refusal to recuse himself.\n\nTrump had sought the stay prior to the start of jury selection. A lone judge in the appeals court had previously rejected a request for an emergency stay halting the trial.\n\nPSEUDONYMS WERE USED TO DISGUISE PARTIES INVOLVED IN ENQUIRER DEAL, LAWYER TESTIFIES\n\nIn drawing up the deal with the National Enquirer involving Stormy Daniels' story about an alleged sexual encounter with Donald Trump, Keith Davidson testified Tuesday that he used pseudonyms to disguise the parties involved.\n\nStormy Daniels became Peggy Peterson and Donald Trump became David Dennison, according to Davidson.\n\nThe alliterative code names were picked, in part, because Daniels was the plaintiff and Trump was the defendant, the lawyer testified.\n\nAsked by prosecutors in Trump's hush money case if David Dennison was a real person, Davidson said that he played on his high school hockey team.\n\n\"And how does he feel about you now?\" asked prosecutor Josh Steinglass.\n\nDavidson stifled a laugh, then answered: \"He's very upset.\"\n\n'MICHAEL COHEN STEPPED INTO AMI'S SHOES,' DAVIDSON SAYS\n\nStormy Daniels' agent reached a six-figure deal with then-National Enquirer editor Dylan Howard for the tabloid to acquire the rights to her story about a sexual encounter with Donald Trump after his \"Access Hollywood\" tape leaked, Keith Davidson testified Tuesday.\n\nBut then, according to Davidson, Howard backed out.\n\nThe editor instead told Daniels' agent, Gina Rodriguez, to call Michael Cohen and complete the deal directly with him -- but she refused to speak with Cohen after an uncomfortable prior interaction.\n\nRodriguez asked Davidson to step in and negotiate the deal with Cohen, the lawyer testified.\n\nDavidson added that he had numerous interactions with Howard over the years regarding stories. Asked if it was unusual for Howard to direct him to make a deal with a third party like Cohen, Davidson responded: \"This is the only time that ever happened.\"\n\n\"In essence, Michael Cohen stepped into AMI's shoes,\" Davidson said, referring to the name of the Enquirer's parent company at the time, American Media Inc.\n\nDavidson testified that in negotiating with Cohen, he hiked the price to $130,000 -- building in his fee for his work on the deal.\n\n'ACCESS HOLLYWOOD' TAPE LEAK MADE DANIELS' STORY MORE MARKETABLE, LAWYER SAYS\n\nStormy Daniels' story about a sexual encounter with Donald Trump became more marketable after the notorious \"Access Hollywood\" tape was leaked, Keith Davidson testified on Tuesday.\n\nDavidson, who previously represented Daniels, told prosecutors that Daniels' agent, Gina Rodriguez, had been trying to drum up interest in her story earlier in the 2016 election cycle but found there wasn't much.\n\nAsked to describe the \"Access Hollywood\" tape, which can't be shown in court, Davidson testified that it involved Trump and the show's then-host Billy Bush being recorded on a \"hot mic\" and \"some statements by both men that were troublesome.\"\n\n'HE WAS JUST SCREAMING,' LAWYER TESTIFIES OF FIRST INTERACTION WITH COHEN\n\nKeith Davidson on Tuesday testified that his first interaction with Michael Cohen related to a 2011 post on a gossip blog that stated that porn actor Stormy Daniels and Trump had \"some sort of physical or romantic interaction.\"\n\nAfter the blog post was published, Davidson said, Daniels' agent Gina Rodriguez called him and said, \"some jerk called me and was very, very aggressive and threatened to sue me.\"\n\nAsked who the \"jerk\" was, Davidson said: \"Michael Cohen.\"\n\nDavidson testified that when he called Cohen, the ex-Trump lawyer greeted him \"with a hostile barrage of insults and insinuations that went on for quite a while.\"\n\n\"I don't think he was accusing us of anything, he was just screaming,\" Davidson continued. \"Finally, after he finished, I explained to him that I was calling because my client, Stormy Daniels, did not want the story up. I wanted to see if he had done anything\" to try to get the story taken down.\n\nDavidson said he eventually sent a cease-and-desist letter to the blog after the dust up with Cohen and the story was removed.\n\nDAVIDSON SAYS HE UNDERSTOOD THE ENQUIRER WOULD NEVER PUBLISH MCDOUGAL'S STORY\n\nLawyer Keith Davidson testified on Tuesday that back-and-forth haggling took place in the selling of former Playboy model Karen McDougal's story to the National Enquirer.\n\nIn one text message shown to jurors, Davidson told Enquirer editor Dylan Howard that \"they are asking me to go back for another 25,\" meaning another $25,000. Howard responds with an expletive, adding, \"Not my money. I'll ask.\"\n\nBut even as they reached a basic framework for the deal, Davidson described his \"growing frustration with the process.\" At one point, Davidson said he was pushed to call Donald Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen directly, something he said he had been trying to avoid.\n\n\"I thought it was odd, certainly,\" Davidson said about being asked to call Cohen. \"I didn't particularly like dealing with him and that's why I was trying like hell to avoid talking to him,\" he added.\n\nDavidson testified that he understood McDougal's story would never be published and acknowledged that \"there was an unspoken understanding that there was an affiliation between David Pecker and Donald Trump and that AMI wouldn't run this story, any story related to Karen, because it would hurt Donald Trump.\"\n\nTRUMP'S ONLINE POSTS FOUND TO VIOLATE GAG ORDER HAVE BEEN REMOVED\n\nDonald Trump's online posts that on Tuesday were found to violate a gag order barring him from speaking publicly about jurors and witnesses in his criminal hush money trial were removed ahead of an afternoon deadline.\n\nThe posts in question were deleted while the court was in recess for lunch.\n\nLinks to the old Truth Social posts redirected to a \"Not found\" message, while those on Trump's website redirected to a 404 error page.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Judge Juan M. Merchan fined the former president $9,000 for the nine posts for violating the order.\n\nTEXAS AG PAXTON AMONG THOSE IN COURTROOM AS TRUMP'S TRIAL RESUMES\n\nCourt in Donald Trump's criminal trial resumed Tuesday after an early afternoon lunch break.\n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton walked into the courtroom with Trump and his entourage after posting on social media earlier in the day that he was there to support the former president. The Republican sat down in the first row of the courtroom gallery directly behind the defense table.\n\nPaxton sat just a few seats away from Trump's son Eric, who sat near the aisle alongside Susie Wiles, a Trump political operative.\n\nKeith Davidson, a lawyer who previously represented former Playboy model Karen McDougal and porn actor Stormy Daniels in hush money negotiations, was expected to returned to the witness stand.\n\nDAVIDSON SHEDS LIGHT ON SEQUENCE OF EVENTS THAT LED TO THE DEAL WITH THE ENQUIRER\n\nKeith Davidson testified Tuesday that after tipping off a National Enquirer editor about \"a blockbuster Trump story,\" he soon arranged a meeting with that editor, former Playboy model Karen McDougal and others to see whether the Enquirer's then-parent company was interested.\n\nAfter flying back to New York, Howard told him the Enquirer wasn't keen \"because Karen McDougal lacked documentary evidence of the interaction,\" Davidson testified.\n\nMcDougal had alleged that she had a year-long affair with Donald Trump years earlier.\n\nA month later, Enquirer editor Dylan Howard reached out again to Davidson, suggesting they resume discussions.\n\nAt the time, Davidson warned that the Enquirer's parent company would need to move quickly, writing in one text: \"Time is of the essence. The girl is being cornered by the estrogen mafia\"\n\nDavidson testified that McDougal was \"teetering\" at the time he sent the message and on the verge of signing a deal to tell her story to ABC News.\n\nDavidson also testified that he played the National Enquirer and ABC News against each other to get the best deal for his client. McDougal didn't want to tell her story publicly, which would've been required if she went to ABC, he said.\n\nJURY SEES TEXTS FROM LAWYER PROMISING TABLOID EDITOR A 'BLOCKBUSTER TRUMP STORY'\n\nIn his court testimony on Tuesday, attorney Keith Davidson described representing Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model, in her allegations of a year-long affair with Donald Trump.\n\nAs questioning turned toward Davidson's involvement in some of the hush money deals at the heart of the former president's criminal trial, he said he met McDougal 25 years ago through a friend. He said he started representing in 2016 \"to provide advice and counsel as to what her rights and obligations would be regarding a personal interaction that she had.\"\n\n\"With whom?\" prosecutor Joshua Steinglass asked.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"Donald Trump.\"\n\nShortly after Davidson began representing McDougal, he said, he reached out to Dylan Howard, the editor in chief of the National Enquirer, promising a \"blockbuster Trump story.\"\n\nHoward replied soon after: \"I will get you more than ANYONE for it. You know why.\"\n\nAs the text messages were displayed on screens to the jury, Davidson testified that he didn't know exactly what Howard meant at the time. But, he noted, \"I knew that Dylan's boss David Pecker and Mr. Trump were longtime friends and had a former business relationship,\" he said, adding the tabloid had effectively \"endorsed Mr. Trump's candidacy.\"\n\nSTORMY DANIELS' FORMER LAWYER CALLED TO THE STAND\n\nA lawyer who previously represented former Playboy model Karen McDougal and porn actor Stormy Daniels was the next witness called to the stand in Donald Trump's hush money trial.\n\nKeith Davidson took the stand shortly after noon Tuesday and is known for representing people trying to sell celebrity sex tapes or other embarrassing information.\n\nHe represented McDougal and Daniels in hush money negotiations with the National Enquirer and Trump's then-lawyer Michael Cohen in 2016.\n\nMcDougal claimed she had had a yearlong affair with Trump in the mid-2000s. Daniels claimed she had a one-time sexual encounter with him in 2006. Trump has denied both allegations.\n\nEXECUTIVE CALLED TO THE STAND TO VERIFY TRANSCRIPT, VIDEO OF TRUMP DEPOSITION\n\nAn executive at a company that provides stenographers and videographers for depositions -- sworn, out-of-court statements under oath -- was the next witness called to the stand in Donald Trump's criminal trial on Tuesday.\n\nPhillip Thompson was called to authenticate a transcript and video of a deposition the former president gave in one of writer E. Jean Carroll's federal defamation lawsuits against him.\n\nThe portions included Carroll's lawyer asking Trump about his Truth Social platform, the dates of his marriage to wife Melania Trump and whether he was aware of the \"Access Hollywood\" tape.\n\nThe former longtime Elle magazine advice columnist had alleged that Trump sexually assaulted her in the 1990s and then defamed her after she came forward publicly in 2019. He has said nothing happened between the two of them and called her a \"wack job\" who engineered a \"hoax\" to sell a book.\n\nAfter two federal trials last year and this winter, juries awarded Carroll over $88 million. Trump is appealing.\n\nVIDEOS OF TRUMP DENYING ALLEGATIONS AND PRAISING COHEN PLAYED IN COURT\n\nProsecutors in Donald Trump's hush money case played C-SPAN clips on Tuesday of the then-presidential candidate on the campaign trail in the final weeks leading up to the 2016 election. In the videos, Trump forcefully denied allegations made by several women after his infamous 2005 \"Access Hollywood\" tape was made public.\n\n\"The stories are total fiction. They're 100% made up, they never happened, they never would happen,\" Trump said in video from an Oct. 14, 2016 rally in North Carolina.\n\nAnother clip played for the jury, from January 2017, showed Trump praising Michael Cohen as as good lawyer and friend.\n\nTrump did not appear to react in court to the clips, which were played on monitors throughout the courtroom, including directly in front of him on the defense table.\n\nAfter confirming the veracity of the clips, Robert Browning -- the executive director of C-SPAN's archives -- was dismissed from the witness stand. Trump's attorneys declined to question him.\n\nEXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF C-SPAN ARCHIVES CALLED TO THE STAND\n\nThe next witness called to the stand Tuesday in Donald Trump's hush money trial was Robert Browning, the executive director of the C-SPAN archives.\n\nBrowning, who manages the network's video collection, was called to verify the authenticity of video of a Trump campaign event.\n\nProsecutors are calling people who are regarded as \"records custodians\" to verify evidence in the former president's criminal case.\n\nTRIAL WILL BREAK FOR 4 DAYS OVER MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND\n\nDonald Trump's hush money trial will get an extra day off for the Memorial Day weekend next month.\n\nCourt won't be in session on Friday, May 24, to accommodate a juror who has a flight that morning, Judge Juan M. Merchan said on Tuesday.\n\nThat means the trial will be off for four straight days for the holiday weekend, resuming on Tuesday, May 28. Merchan also informed jurors there will not be court on May 17, though he didn't give them a reason.\n\nThat's the day Donald Trump will be attending his son Barron's high school graduation.\n\nPROSECUTORS WANT TO QUESTION TRUMP ABOUT GAG ORDER VIOLATIONS IF HE TESTIFIES\n\nAhead of a midday break in Donald Trump's hush money case, prosecutors asked the judge to let them question the former president about his gag order violations should he choose to testify.\n\nThe request came after Judge Juan M. Merchan ruled Tuesday morning that Trump had on nine occasions violated a court mandate barring him from speaking publicly about witnesses and jurors in the case. He ultimately fined Trump $9,000 and will hold another hearing Thursday on four more alleged gag order violations.\n\nProsecutors also requested permission to introduce evidence they said shows Trump orchestrated a \"pressure campaign and intimidation effort\" against Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels.\n\nColangelo said Trump's attorney opened the door to that evidence by seeking to undermine the credibility of the two witnesses in opening statements.\n\nMerchan did not immediately rule, but said, \"the door has been opened.\"\n\nHe previously ruled to allow prosecutors to challenge Trump's credibility by questioning him about a limited number of his recent legal setbacks if he ends up taking the witness stand.\n\nTrump has said he wants to testify, but is under no obligation to do so.\n\nNO RED FLAGS ABOUT COHEN'S ACCOUNTS AT THE TIME, FARRO SAYS\n\nIn his cross examination of banker Gary Farro on Tuesday, defense attorney Todd Blanche underscored that Michael Cohen made no mention that the accounts he opened in October 2016 had anything to do with deals involving then-presidential candidate Donald Trump or his company.\n\nIf Cohen had done so, \"I would have asked questions,\" Farro said.\n\nFarro noted that he might not have opened a bank account for Cohen if he'd been told it was for what's known as a shell corporation -- one that receives and sends out money but doesn't have an underlying business.\n\nBut Cohen, the banker said, told him the account was for a real estate consulting business.\n\nNothing about it raised \"any red flags to you?\" Blanche asked.\n\n\"Not based upon the answers I was given to the questions I asked,\" Farro said.\n\nFarro's testimony shed light on his role in helping Cohen open a bank account that was later used to process a $130,000 wire transfer to a lawyer for Stormy Daniels.\n\nDEFENSE BEGINS CROSS-EXAMINATION OF FARRO\n\nDefense attorneys began their cross-examination of Gary Farro, the prosecution's third witness in Donald Trump's hush money trial, by asking the banker to describe his relationship with Michael Cohen.\n\nFarro said he first met Cohen -- then serving as the former president's personal lawyer -- in person at a meeting in Trump Tower, but primarily communicated over the phone. Pushed by Todd Blanche, Farro acknowledged that Cohen wasn't always easy to work with.\n\n\"He was a challenging client because of his desire to get things done so quickly,\" Farro said. \"Ninety percent of the time it was an urgent matter.\"\n\nPROSECUTORS WRAP QUESTIONING OF FARRO\n\nProsecutors have wrapped up questioning of Gary Farro, their third witness in Donald Trump's criminal hush money trial.\n\nFarro told prosecutors on Tuesday that Michael Cohen had indicated that a 2016 $130,000 wire payment now at the heart of the case was related to a real estate transaction -- not a political candidate, an adult film performer or buying up a potential media story.\n\n\"We might consider something like that a reputational risk,\" Farro said.\n\nWithin a day of opening the Essential Consultants LLC bank account on Oct. 26, 2016 -- and funding it with about $130,000 from his own home equity loan -- Cohen wired out $130,000 to Keith Davidson, then a lawyer for Stormy Daniels, documents showed.\n\nThe 2016 presidential election was on Nov. 8.\n\nFAMILY JOINS TRUMP IN COURT FOR THE FIRST TIME\n\nDonald Trump's son Eric joined his father in court on Tuesday, marking the first time any of the former president's family members have attended his criminal hush money trial.\n\nPrior to court proceedings resuming, Trump turned from the defense table and walked over to his son in the first row of the gallery. Trump put his hand on Eric's arm as they chatted.\n\nTrump had railed about the trial, as well as his other legal cases, to reporters on his way into the courtroom earlier in the morning.\n\nFARRO RETURNS TO THE STAND\n\nTestimony in Donald Trump's hush money trial resumed with Gary Farro, a banker who helped Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen open accounts. Cohen used one such account to buy the silence of porn performer Stormy Daniels in the weeks before the 2016 election. She alleged a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump, which he denies.\n\nCohen indicated the account, opened in late October 2016 in the name of Essential Consultants LLC, would be used for real estate consulting, according to testimony and documents shown at the trial.\n\nIn response to prosecutor Becky Mangold's questions, Farro said the bank would have asked more questions if there had been any mention of a connection to a political candidate, buying a story that was being pitched to the media or paying a porn performer.\n\nThe additional scrutiny would have delayed or even nixed opening the account, which Cohen had wanted to open right away. In particular, the adult film world \"is an industry we don't work with,\" he said.\n\nWith only real estate in the picture, the account was opened within a day -- \"very quick,\" Farro said.\n\nMERCHAN FINDS POST ABOUT COHEN AND DANIELS WAS NOT A VIOLATION\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan found that one of Donald Trump's online posts about his former lawyer Michael Cohen and porn actor Stormy Daniels did not violate a gag order barring him from speaking publicly about jurors and witnesses in his hush money case.\n\nMerchan wrote that he was finding Trump \"in criminal contempt for willfully disobeying a lawful mandate\" of the court on nine separate occasions for posts made on Truth Social and his campaign website.\n\nMerchan ruled that Trump's April 10 post referring to Cohen and Daniels as \"sleaze bags\" was not a gag order violation. He said Trump's contention that he was responding to previous posts by Cohen \"is sufficient to give\" him pause \"as to whether the People have met their burden\" as to that post.\n\nHowever, the other nine \"attack the credibility of arguably two of the more high-profile witnesses in this case.\"\n\n\"To allow such attacks upon protected witnesses with blanket assertions that they are all responses to 'political attacks' would be an exception that swallowed the rule. The Expanded Order does not contain such an exception,\" Merchan wrote.\n\nJUDGE FINDS TRUMP VIOLATED GAG ORDER, FINES HIM $9K\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan ruled Tuesday morning that Donald Trump violated a gag order barring him from making public statements about witnesses and jurors in his hush money trial nine times. He fined the former president $9,000 for the violations.\n\nProsecutors had alleged the former president had violated the order 10 times, and Merchan concurred in all but one of those instances. The judge will hold a hearing Thursday on four more alleged violations.\n\nThe former president stared down at the table in front of him as Merchan read the ruling, frowning slightly but otherwise showing no expression.\n\nMerchan wrote in his ruling that Trump \"is hereby warned that the Court will not tolerate continued willful violations of its lawful orders\" and raised the possibility of jail time if \"necessary and appropriate under the circumstances.\"\n\nJUDGE TO ALLOW TRUMP TO ATTEND SON'S GRADUATION\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan said Tuesday morning that Donald Trump's criminal hush money trial will not be held on May 17 so that the former president can attend his son's graduation.\n\n\"I don't think the May 17 date is a problem, so Mr. Trump can certainly attend that date, attend his son's graduation,\" Merchan said.\n\nTrump had previously requested the day off from court to accommodate his son Barron's high school graduation.\n\nTRUMP ARRIVES AT COURT\n\nDonald Trump's motorcade arrived Tuesday morning at the courthouse in lower Manhattan just before 9 a.m., kicking off the second week of witness testimony in the former president's hush money trial.\n\nA crowd of around 60 Trump supporters had gathered across the street from the building, waving Trump and American flags on tall poles.\n\nTRUMP LEAVES TRUMP TOWER FOR COURT\n\nDonald Trump entered his motorcade outside Trump Tower in midtown, headed to the courthouse in lower Manhattan for the second week of trial testimony.\n\nThe former president on Tuesday will be in court for testimony from the third prosecution witness, Gary Farro, a banker who helped Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen open accounts.\n\nCohen used one to buy the silence of porn performer Stormy Daniels. She alleged a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump, which he denies.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

        "text": "AP\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Witness testimony in Donald Trump's criminal trial advanced on Tuesday with three people taking the stand, including Keith Davidson, a lawyer who previously represented Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal in hush money negotiations involving the former president.\n\nDavidson's testimony dominated the afternoon, highlighting his interactions with Trump's ex-lawyer Michael Cohen and detailing the lead-up to a deal that ultimately came with a $130,000 payment to Daniels.\n\nTuesday's proceedings, however, kicked off with the judge holding Trump in contempt and fining him $9,000 over nine online posts that he found violated a gag order barring the former president from speaking publicly about jurors and witnesses in the case.\n\nMerchan warned that if Trump does it again, he could be jailed.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Prosecutors say Trump obscured the true nature of those payments and falsely recorded them as legal expenses.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.\n\nThe case is the first-ever criminal trial of a former U.S. president and the first of four prosecutions of Trump to reach a jury.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- Key players: Who's who at Donald Trump's hush money criminal trial\n\n-- The hush money case is just one of Trump's legal cases.

Merchan of bias and of rushing the case, and also saying he should be out campaigning.\n\nTrump was found in contempt of court earlier in the day and fined $9,000 for nine violations of the gag order, which bars him from speaking publicly about witnesses and jurors in the case.\n\nDAVIDSON SAYS HE THOUGHT DANIELS' STORY WOULD 'BE A TORNADO' IF IT GOT OUT\n\nKeith Davidson and Dylan Howard, then-editor of the National Enquirer, texted each other about what Howard called an \"impending storm\" of publicity if Stormy Daniels took her story elsewhere after Michael Cohen failed to make a payment in the deal on time, according to Davidson's testimony and documents shown at the trial on Tuesday.\n\nDavidson wrote to Howard that he believed Daniels and her agent had agreed to bring her story about a sexual encounter with Donald Trump to another publication, and \"I think it'll be a full-on blitz.\"\n\n\"I just felt like there was going to be more than a flurry of activity. I felt like it was going to be a tornado,\" Davidson explained in court.\n\n\"If the story got out,\" Steinglass asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Davidson said.\n\nAsked if Cohen ever told him who he was representing in the Daniels negotiations, Davidson said that he may not have explicitly stated he was working on Trump's behalf -- but the implication was clear.\n\nCOHEN MISSED DEADLINE TO PAY $130K TO STORMY DANIELS, DAVIDSON SAYS\n\nBefore a brief afternoon break in Donald Trump's hush money trial, lawyer Keith Davidson testified Tuesday that Michael Cohen missed an agreed upon deadline for sending a $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels.\n\nAt first, Cohen offered a litany of explanations for the delay, at turns blaming broken computers, Secret Service \"firewalls,\" and the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur. \"The things he was saying didn't really make sense,\" Davidson said of Cohen.\n\nAs the excuses piled up, Davidson said he understood that Cohen \"didn't have the authority to actually spend money.\" He eventually sent an email informing Cohen that the deal involving Daniel's story about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump was off.\n\n\"I thought he was trying to kick the can down the round until after the election,\" Davidson said.\n\nAPPELLATE COURT REJECTS TRUMP'S REQUEST TO STAY HUSH MONEY TRIAL\n\nAs testimony continued in Donald Trump's hush money trial on Tuesday, a five-judge panel in New York state's mid-level appellate court rejected the former president's request for a stay of the proceedings while he appeals several pretrial rulings, including the trial judge's refusal to recuse himself.\n\nTrump had sought the stay prior to the start of jury selection. A lone judge in the appeals court had previously rejected a request for an emergency stay halting the trial.\n\nPSEUDONYMS WERE USED TO DISGUISE PARTIES INVOLVED IN ENQUIRER DEAL, LAWYER TESTIFIES\n\nIn drawing up the deal with the National Enquirer involving Stormy Daniels' story about an alleged sexual encounter with Donald Trump, Keith Davidson testified Tuesday that he used pseudonyms to disguise the parties involved.\n\nStormy Daniels became Peggy Peterson and Donald Trump became David Dennison, according to Davidson.\n\nThe alliterative code names were picked, in part, because Daniels was the plaintiff and Trump was the defendant, the lawyer testified.\n\nAsked by prosecutors in Trump's hush money case if David Dennison was a real person, Davidson said that he played on his high school hockey team.\n\n\"And how does he feel about you now?\" asked prosecutor Josh Steinglass.\n\nDavidson stifled a laugh, then answered: \"He's very upset.\"\n\n'MICHAEL COHEN STEPPED INTO AMI'S SHOES,' DAVIDSON SAYS\n\nStormy Daniels' agent reached a six-figure deal with then-National Enquirer editor Dylan Howard for the tabloid to acquire the rights to her story about a sexual encounter with Donald Trump after his \"Access Hollywood\" tape leaked, Keith Davidson testified Tuesday.\n\nBut then, according to Davidson, Howard backed out.\n\nThe editor instead told Daniels' agent, Gina Rodriguez, to call Michael Cohen and complete the deal directly with him -- but she refused to speak with Cohen after an uncomfortable prior interaction.\n\nRodriguez asked Davidson to step in and negotiate the deal with Cohen, the lawyer testified.\n\nDavidson added that he had numerous interactions with Howard over the years regarding stories. Asked if it was unusual for Howard to direct him to make a deal with a third party like Cohen, Davidson responded: \"This is the only time that ever happened.\"\n\n\"In essence, Michael Cohen stepped into AMI's shoes,\" Davidson said, referring to the name of the Enquirer's parent company at the time, American Media Inc.\n\nDavidson testified that in negotiating with Cohen, he hiked the price to $130,000 -- building in his fee for his work on the deal.\n\n'ACCESS HOLLYWOOD' TAPE LEAK MADE DANIELS' STORY MORE MARKETABLE, LAWYER SAYS\n\nStormy Daniels' story about a sexual encounter with Donald Trump became more marketable after the notorious \"Access Hollywood\" tape was leaked, Keith Davidson testified on Tuesday.\n\nDavidson, who previously represented Daniels, told prosecutors that Daniels' agent, Gina Rodriguez, had been trying to drum up interest in her story earlier in the 2016 election cycle but found there wasn't much.\n\nAsked to describe the \"Access Hollywood\" tape, which can't be shown in court, Davidson testified that it involved Trump and the show's then-host Billy Bush being recorded on a \"hot mic\" and \"some statements by both men that were troublesome.\"\n\n'HE WAS JUST SCREAMING,' LAWYER TESTIFIES OF FIRST INTERACTION WITH COHEN\n\nKeith Davidson on Tuesday testified that his first interaction with Michael Cohen related to a 2011 post on a gossip blog that stated that porn actor Stormy Daniels and Trump had \"some sort of physical or romantic interaction.\"\n\nAfter the blog post was published, Davidson said, Daniels' agent Gina Rodriguez called him and said, \"some jerk called me and was very, very aggressive and threatened to sue me.\"\n\nAsked who the \"jerk\" was, Davidson said: \"Michael Cohen.\"\n\nDavidson testified that when he called Cohen, the ex-Trump lawyer greeted him \"with a hostile barrage of insults and insinuations that went on for quite a while.\"\n\n\"I don't think he was accusing us of anything, he was just screaming,\" Davidson continued. \"Finally, after he finished, I explained to him that I was calling because my client, Stormy Daniels, did not want the story up. I wanted to see if he had done anything\" to try to get the story taken down.\n\nDavidson said he eventually sent a cease-and-desist letter to the blog after the dust up with Cohen and the story was removed.\n\nDAVIDSON SAYS HE UNDERSTOOD THE ENQUIRER WOULD NEVER PUBLISH MCDOUGAL'S STORY\n\nLawyer Keith Davidson testified on Tuesday that back-and-forth haggling took place in the selling of former Playboy model Karen McDougal's story to the National Enquirer.\n\nIn one text message shown to jurors, Davidson told Enquirer editor Dylan Howard that \"they are asking me to go back for another 25,\" meaning another $25,000. Howard responds with an expletive, adding, \"Not my money. I'll ask.\"\n\nBut even as they reached a basic framework for the deal, Davidson described his \"growing frustration with the process.\" At one point, Davidson said he was pushed to call Donald Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen directly, something he said he had been trying to avoid.\n\n\"I thought it was odd, certainly,\" Davidson said about being asked to call Cohen. \"I didn't particularly like dealing with him and that's why I was trying like hell to avoid talking to him,\" he added.\n\nDavidson testified that he understood McDougal's story would never be published and acknowledged that \"there was an unspoken understanding that there was an affiliation between David Pecker and Donald Trump and that AMI wouldn't run this story, any story related to Karen, because it would hurt Donald Trump.\"\n\nTRUMP'S ONLINE POSTS FOUND TO VIOLATE GAG ORDER HAVE BEEN REMOVED\n\nDonald Trump's online posts that on Tuesday were found to violate a gag order barring him from speaking publicly about jurors and witnesses in his criminal hush money trial were removed ahead of an afternoon deadline.\n\nThe posts in question were deleted while the court was in recess for lunch.\n\nLinks to the old Truth Social posts redirected to a \"Not found\" message, while those on Trump's website redirected to a 404 error page.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Judge Juan M. Merchan fined the former president $9,000 for the nine posts for violating the order.\n\nTEXAS AG PAXTON AMONG THOSE IN COURTROOM AS TRUMP'S TRIAL RESUMES\n\nCourt in Donald Trump's criminal trial resumed Tuesday after an early afternoon lunch break.\n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton walked into the courtroom with Trump and his entourage after posting on social media earlier in the day that he was there to support the former president. The Republican sat down in the first row of the courtroom gallery directly behind the defense table.\n\nPaxton sat just a few seats away from Trump's son Eric, who sat near the aisle alongside Susie Wiles, a Trump political operative.\n\nKeith Davidson, a lawyer who previously represented former Playboy model Karen McDougal and porn actor Stormy Daniels in hush money negotiations, was expected to returned to the witness stand.\n\nDAVIDSON SHEDS LIGHT ON SEQUENCE OF EVENTS THAT LED TO THE DEAL WITH THE ENQUIRER\n\nKeith Davidson testified Tuesday that after tipping off a National Enquirer editor about \"a blockbuster Trump story,\" he soon arranged a meeting with that editor, former Playboy model Karen McDougal and others to see whether the Enquirer's then-parent company was interested.\n\nAfter flying back to New York, Howard told him the Enquirer wasn't keen \"because Karen McDougal lacked documentary evidence of the interaction,\" Davidson testified.\n\nMcDougal had alleged that she had a year-long affair with Donald Trump years earlier.\n\nA month later, Enquirer editor Dylan Howard reached out again to Davidson, suggesting they resume discussions.\n\nAt the time, Davidson warned that the Enquirer's parent company would need to move quickly, writing in one text: \"Time is of the essence. The girl is being cornered by the estrogen mafia\"\n\nDavidson testified that McDougal was \"teetering\" at the time he sent the message and on the verge of signing a deal to tell her story to ABC News.\n\nDavidson also testified that he played the National Enquirer and ABC News against each other to get the best deal for his client. McDougal didn't want to tell her story publicly, which would've been required if she went to ABC, he said.\n\nJURY SEES TEXTS FROM LAWYER PROMISING TABLOID EDITOR A 'BLOCKBUSTER TRUMP STORY'\n\nIn his court testimony on Tuesday, attorney Keith Davidson described representing Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model, in her allegations of a year-long affair with Donald Trump.\n\nAs questioning turned toward Davidson's involvement in some of the hush money deals at the heart of the former president's criminal trial, he said he met McDougal 25 years ago through a friend. He said he started representing in 2016 \"to provide advice and counsel as to what her rights and obligations would be regarding a personal interaction that she had.\"\n\n\"With whom?\" prosecutor Joshua Steinglass asked.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"Donald Trump.\"\n\nShortly after Davidson began representing McDougal, he said, he reached out to Dylan Howard, the editor in chief of the National Enquirer, promising a \"blockbuster Trump story.\"\n\nHoward replied soon after: \"I will get you more than ANYONE for it. You know why.\"\n\nAs the text messages were displayed on screens to the jury, Davidson testified that he didn't know exactly what Howard meant at the time. But, he noted, \"I knew that Dylan's boss David Pecker and Mr. Trump were longtime friends and had a former business relationship,\" he said, adding the tabloid had effectively \"endorsed Mr. Trump's candidacy.\"\n\nSTORMY DANIELS' FORMER LAWYER CALLED TO THE STAND\n\nA lawyer who previously represented former Playboy model Karen McDougal and porn actor Stormy Daniels was the next witness called to the stand in Donald Trump's hush money trial.\n\nKeith Davidson took the stand shortly after noon Tuesday and is known for representing people trying to sell celebrity sex tapes or other embarrassing information.\n\nHe represented McDougal and Daniels in hush money negotiations with the National Enquirer and Trump's then-lawyer Michael Cohen in 2016.\n\nMcDougal claimed she had had a yearlong affair with Trump in the mid-2000s. Daniels claimed she had a one-time sexual encounter with him in 2006. Trump has denied both allegations.\n\nEXECUTIVE CALLED TO THE STAND TO VERIFY TRANSCRIPT, VIDEO OF TRUMP DEPOSITION\n\nAn executive at a company that provides stenographers and videographers for depositions -- sworn, out-of-court statements under oath -- was the next witness called to the stand in Donald Trump's criminal trial on Tuesday.\n\nPhillip Thompson was called to authenticate a transcript and video of a deposition the former president gave in one of writer E. Jean Carroll's federal defamation lawsuits against him.\n\nThe portions included Carroll's lawyer asking Trump about his Truth Social platform, the dates of his marriage to wife Melania Trump and whether he was aware of the \"Access Hollywood\" tape.\n\nThe former longtime Elle magazine advice columnist had alleged that Trump sexually assaulted her in the 1990s and then defamed her after she came forward publicly in 2019. He has said nothing happened between the two of them and called her a \"wack job\" who engineered a \"hoax\" to sell a book.\n\nAfter two federal trials last year and this winter, juries awarded Carroll over $88 million. Trump is appealing.\n\nVIDEOS OF TRUMP DENYING ALLEGATIONS AND PRAISING COHEN PLAYED IN COURT\n\nProsecutors in Donald Trump's hush money case played C-SPAN clips on Tuesday of the then-presidential candidate on the campaign trail in the final weeks leading up to the 2016 election. In the videos, Trump forcefully denied allegations made by several women after his infamous 2005 \"Access Hollywood\" tape was made public.\n\n\"The stories are total fiction. They're 100% made up, they never happened, they never would happen,\" Trump said in video from an Oct. 14, 2016 rally in North Carolina.\n\nAnother clip played for the jury, from January 2017, showed Trump praising Michael Cohen as as good lawyer and friend.\n\nTrump did not appear to react in court to the clips, which were played on monitors throughout the courtroom, including directly in front of him on the defense table.\n\nAfter confirming the veracity of the clips, Robert Browning -- the executive director of C-SPAN's archives -- was dismissed from the witness stand. Trump's attorneys declined to question him.\n\nEXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF C-SPAN ARCHIVES CALLED TO THE STAND\n\nThe next witness called to the stand Tuesday in Donald Trump's hush money trial was Robert Browning, the executive director of the C-SPAN archives.\n\nBrowning, who manages the network's video collection, was called to verify the authenticity of video of a Trump campaign event.\n\nProsecutors are calling people who are regarded as \"records custodians\" to verify evidence in the former president's criminal case.\n\nTRIAL WILL BREAK FOR 4 DAYS OVER MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND\n\nDonald Trump's hush money trial will get an extra day off for the Memorial Day weekend next month.\n\nCourt won't be in session on Friday, May 24, to accommodate a juror who has a flight that morning, Judge Juan M. Merchan said on Tuesday.\n\nThat means the trial will be off for four straight days for the holiday weekend, resuming on Tuesday, May 28. Merchan also informed jurors there will not be court on May 17, though he didn't give them a reason.\n\nThat's the day Donald Trump will be attending his son Barron's high school graduation.\n\nPROSECUTORS WANT TO QUESTION TRUMP ABOUT GAG ORDER VIOLATIONS IF HE TESTIFIES\n\nAhead of a midday break in Donald Trump's hush money case, prosecutors asked the judge to let them question the former president about his gag order violations should he choose to testify.\n\nThe request came after Judge Juan M. Merchan ruled Tuesday morning that Trump had on nine occasions violated a court mandate barring him from speaking publicly about witnesses and jurors in the case. He ultimately fined Trump $9,000 and will hold another hearing Thursday on four more alleged gag order violations.\n\nProsecutors also requested permission to introduce evidence they said shows Trump orchestrated a \"pressure campaign and intimidation effort\" against Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels.\n\nColangelo said Trump's attorney opened the door to that evidence by seeking to undermine the credibility of the two witnesses in opening statements.\n\nMerchan did not immediately rule, but said, \"the door has been opened.\"\n\nHe previously ruled to allow prosecutors to challenge Trump's credibility by questioning him about a limited number of his recent legal setbacks if he ends up taking the witness stand.\n\nTrump has said he wants to testify, but is under no obligation to do so.\n\nNO RED FLAGS ABOUT COHEN'S ACCOUNTS AT THE TIME, FARRO SAYS\n\nIn his cross examination of banker Gary Farro on Tuesday, defense attorney Todd Blanche underscored that Michael Cohen made no mention that the accounts he opened in October 2016 had anything to do with deals involving then-presidential candidate Donald Trump or his company.\n\nIf Cohen had done so, \"I would have asked questions,\" Farro said.\n\nFarro noted that he might not have opened a bank account for Cohen if he'd been told it was for what's known as a shell corporation -- one that receives and sends out money but doesn't have an underlying business.\n\nBut Cohen, the banker said, told him the account was for a real estate consulting business.\n\nNothing about it raised \"any red flags to you?\" Blanche asked.\n\n\"Not based upon the answers I was given to the questions I asked,\" Farro said.\n\nFarro's testimony shed light on his role in helping Cohen open a bank account that was later used to process a $130,000 wire transfer to a lawyer for Stormy Daniels.\n\nDEFENSE BEGINS CROSS-EXAMINATION OF FARRO\n\nDefense attorneys began their cross-examination of Gary Farro, the prosecution's third witness in Donald Trump's hush money trial, by asking the banker to describe his relationship with Michael Cohen.\n\nFarro said he first met Cohen -- then serving as the former president's personal lawyer -- in person at a meeting in Trump Tower, but primarily communicated over the phone. Pushed by Todd Blanche, Farro acknowledged that Cohen wasn't always easy to work with.\n\n\"He was a challenging client because of his desire to get things done so quickly,\" Farro said. \"Ninety percent of the time it was an urgent matter.\"\n\nPROSECUTORS WRAP QUESTIONING OF FARRO\n\nProsecutors have wrapped up questioning of Gary Farro, their third witness in Donald Trump's criminal hush money trial.\n\nFarro told prosecutors on Tuesday that Michael Cohen had indicated that a 2016 $130,000 wire payment now at the heart of the case was related to a real estate transaction -- not a political candidate, an adult film performer or buying up a potential media story.\n\n\"We might consider something like that a reputational risk,\" Farro said.\n\nWithin a day of opening the Essential Consultants LLC bank account on Oct. 26, 2016 -- and funding it with about $130,000 from his own home equity loan -- Cohen wired out $130,000 to Keith Davidson, then a lawyer for Stormy Daniels, documents showed.\n\nThe 2016 presidential election was on Nov. 8.\n\nFAMILY JOINS TRUMP IN COURT FOR THE FIRST TIME\n\nDonald Trump's son Eric joined his father in court on Tuesday, marking the first time any of the former president's family members have attended his criminal hush money trial.\n\nPrior to court proceedings resuming, Trump turned from the defense table and walked over to his son in the first row of the gallery. Trump put his hand on Eric's arm as they chatted.\n\nTrump had railed about the trial, as well as his other legal cases, to reporters on his way into the courtroom earlier in the morning.\n\nFARRO RETURNS TO THE STAND\n\nTestimony in Donald Trump's hush money trial resumed with Gary Farro, a banker who helped Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen open accounts. Cohen used one such account to buy the silence of porn performer Stormy Daniels in the weeks before the 2016 election. She alleged a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump, which he denies.\n\nCohen indicated the account, opened in late October 2016 in the name of Essential Consultants LLC, would be used for real estate consulting, according to testimony and documents shown at the trial.\n\nIn response to prosecutor Becky Mangold's questions, Farro said the bank would have asked more questions if there had been any mention of a connection to a political candidate, buying a story that was being pitched to the media or paying a porn performer.\n\nThe additional scrutiny would have delayed or even nixed opening the account, which Cohen had wanted to open right away. In particular, the adult film world \"is an industry we don't work with,\" he said.\n\nWith only real estate in the picture, the account was opened within a day -- \"very quick,\" Farro said.\n\nMERCHAN FINDS POST ABOUT COHEN AND DANIELS WAS NOT A VIOLATION\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan found that one of Donald Trump's online posts about his former lawyer Michael Cohen and porn actor Stormy Daniels did not violate a gag order barring him from speaking publicly about jurors and witnesses in his hush money case.\n\nMerchan wrote that he was finding Trump \"in criminal contempt for willfully disobeying a lawful mandate\" of the court on nine separate occasions for posts made on Truth Social and his campaign website.\n\nMerchan ruled that Trump's April 10 post referring to Cohen and Daniels as \"sleaze bags\" was not a gag order violation. He said Trump's contention that he was responding to previous posts by Cohen \"is sufficient to give\" him pause \"as to whether the People have met their burden\" as to that post.\n\nHowever, the other nine \"attack the credibility of arguably two of the more high-profile witnesses in this case.\"\n\n\"To allow such attacks upon protected witnesses with blanket assertions that they are all responses to 'political attacks' would be an exception that swallowed the rule. The Expanded Order does not contain such an exception,\" Merchan wrote.\n\nJUDGE FINDS TRUMP VIOLATED GAG ORDER, FINES HIM $9K\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan ruled Tuesday morning that Donald Trump violated a gag order barring him from making public statements about witnesses and jurors in his hush money trial nine times. He fined the former president $9,000 for the violations.\n\nProsecutors had alleged the former president had violated the order 10 times, and Merchan concurred in all but one of those instances. The judge will hold a hearing Thursday on four more alleged violations.\n\nThe former president stared down at the table in front of him as Merchan read the ruling, frowning slightly but otherwise showing no expression.\n\nMerchan wrote in his ruling that Trump \"is hereby warned that the Court will not tolerate continued willful violations of its lawful orders\" and raised the possibility of jail time if \"necessary and appropriate under the circumstances.\"\n\nJUDGE TO ALLOW TRUMP TO ATTEND SON'S GRADUATION\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan said Tuesday morning that Donald Trump's criminal hush money trial will not be held on May 17 so that the former president can attend his son's graduation.\n\n\"I don't think the May 17 date is a problem, so Mr. Trump can certainly attend that date, attend his son's graduation,\" Merchan said.\n\nTrump had previously requested the day off from court to accommodate his son Barron's high school graduation.\n\nTRUMP ARRIVES AT COURT\n\nDonald Trump's motorcade arrived Tuesday morning at the courthouse in lower Manhattan just before 9 a.m., kicking off the second week of witness testimony in the former president's hush money trial.\n\nA crowd of around 60 Trump supporters had gathered across the street from the building, waving Trump and American flags on tall poles.\n\nTRUMP LEAVES TRUMP TOWER FOR COURT\n\nDonald Trump entered his motorcade outside Trump Tower in midtown, headed to the courthouse in lower Manhattan for the second week of trial testimony.\n\nThe former president on Tuesday will be in court for testimony from the third prosecution witness, Gary Farro, a banker who helped Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen open accounts.\n\nCohen used one to buy the silence of porn performer Stormy Daniels. She alleged a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump, which he denies.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

        "text": "WhatsApp has spared no expense in giving its users the best instant messaging experience possible, and keeping a close eye on the constant evolution seen in the beta versions is evidence enough. One could argue that the best chat app in the world already works well, but Meta engineers aren't slacking off, and have been hard at work in April giving beta testers a taste of what's coming. Stable channel users received a few updates too, so here's a look at the 11 best WhatsApp changes this month.\n\nRelated Our top 11 WhatsApp tips and tricks you need to know Improve your WhatsApp experience with these handy tips Updates for everyone\n\nApril brought three major updates for the general populace who refused to install the beta version of the app, which usually doesn't experience hiccups either. First, WhatsApp changed the UI design to move the tab switcher to the bottom of the screen, bringing back the swipe gesture to cycle through tabs we have seen in testing many times before.\n\nSource: WhatsApp\n\nWhatsApp is also rolling out support for pinning more than one message to each conversation. Unlike starred messages, pins are visible to all participants in the conversation, and you can now pin three messages instead of just one, but pins are designed to expire after 30 days at most. Speaking of ephemeral things, you only get a short while before responding to unreads becomes awkward. If you're a busy person, WhatsApp's new chat filters can help place the unreads at the top. The app also has a filter to separate your group chats from individual conversations.\n\nThe UI got big changes\n\nWhile swipeable navigation between the app's tabs is here to stay, the change is accompanied by several smaller tweaks. Most importantly, WhatsApp has switched to a persistent search bar located at the top, which wasn't perfect when the redesign was first released. The app has also switched to a white color scheme with green accents from the green header with a white WhatsApp logo.\n\nThe lighter color scheme brings a much-needed touch of modernization to the WhatsApp UI, which remained largely unchanged for several years, save for minor modifications to incorporate new features like the Communities tab, which started life as a tiny tab on the far left-hand side in the tab bar. Now, all the tabs in the bottom bar are equally wide too.\n\nFull Story WhatsApp's new colorless design is rolling out in beta Pale white is the new green Meta brings its AI chatbot to beta testers\n\nAI already feels like an overused buzzword, but most WhatsApp users haven't seen AI in the app, yet. That could change soon because Meta is testing the integration of its AI chatbot. The experiment was previously limited, but it expanded to more testers in April. Participating accounts would notice a circular blue trigger button in the upper right corner of the Chats tab, which converts the app search bar into a prompt field for the AI.\n\nRelated Meta AI: What is it, who can use it, and how? Learn about Meta AI and how you can use this free, open source artificial intelligence to chat, create images, and more Have favorites on speed dial, and new contacts too\n\nWhile AI can simplify mundane tasks, you still need to add new contacts to WhatsApp manually, and that usually involves switching to your dialer app. To curb this inconvenience, April marked the sighting of a new in-app dialer which would help users save time adding new contacts and calling them. However, the feature is still in development, and it might be a few months before we see it fully fleshed out and ready for a worldwide release.\n\nClose\n\nAdditionally, WhatsApp is testing a new way to quickly call contacts you mark as favorites. In the Calls tab, these contacts show up pinned at the top of the chronologically sequenced list of recents. The favorite contacts have quick shortcuts to initiate a voice or a video call, which are otherwise accessible in the Chats tab when you tap the contact's profile picture.\n\nProper management for favorite contacts\n\nWhile we are on the subject of favorite contacts, it would be remiss to gloss over WhatsApp's recent efforts to help billions of users properly manage favorite contacts. If this change clears testing, users could see a new option called Favorites show up in the app's main Settings menu. Here, users should be able to manage all the contacts they have marked as favorites and remove others conveniently if required. Details are scarce, so the developers might need to work on it some more before it is pushed out.\n\nRelated WhatsApp working on on a tool to help you manage favorite contacts You'll be able to add, reorder, and remove favorites all in one place WhatsApp Web gets a redesigned sidebar too\n\nSwitching between all these tabs can get a little complicated on the WhatsApp Web UI, especially if you're only habituated to the mobile version. However, Meta plans to make it simpler using a column of vertically-stacked icons in the sidebar on the left. It should offer easy access to Channels, Chats, Archive, Communities, and Starred Messages. However, the Chats tab remains the default of choice for the UI even during testing that has been ongoing for over a year now, and it is unlikely we will see that focus change anytime soon.\n\nDevelopment for People nearby continues behind closed doors\n\nWhile most of the beta changes are accessible to testers, some aren't even available for testing. One such development is a feature called People nearby. As the name suggests, it would use location and GPS permissions to find WhatsApp users near you. If other users' preferences have set them to be discoverable, you could transfer files to them wirelessly, just like when using Quick Share.\n\nRelated Nearby Share is dead, long live Quick Share Google partners with Samsung for a rebrand and subtle visual changes\n\nAlthough such an implementation would uncork a proverbial can of worms in terms of privacy, it could also save users the friction of manually exchanging contact information. Another advantage of using this would be WhatsApp's sheer popularity, helping bridge the divide between Android's Quick Share and Apple's AirDrop. April's updates suggest refinement is underway before beta testing begins.\n\nAnnotations galore, coming to an update near you\n\nWhile WhatsApp is big on convenience already, upcoming updates will add note-taking support. While this feature is primarily targeted at enterprise users and small businesses, WhatsApp will allow users to create notes for every saved contact. The app is also working on a way to add a message from the conversation to a note without tedious copy-pasting.\n\nClose\n\nThe feature should allow businesses to maintain detailed customer profiles, giving every support executive using WhatsApp immediate access to small details like a customer's pronouns, their shipping preferences, address, contact information, etc. Saved notes will only be visible to the creator, and not the saved contact.\n\nCommunities are for events\n\nWhatsApp's equivalent of a Discord server is called Communities, if you equate individual topical group chats to channels within the server. Meta has been working on an event scheduling feature for Communities since October last year, and we saw the feature again in April. The events in question can be a virtual voice or video call where participants of the community can congregate for interaction. The UI we saw this time also had a toggle for creating a WhatsApp call link besides scheduling the date and time of the event.\n\nChat lock coming to linked devices\n\nWhile some users prefer interaction, others may prefer privacy. However, WhatsApp linked devices don't support all the features you see on your primary device. One such feature is chat lock, which is available on your primary smartphone, but not on any linked smartphone, leaving confidential chats hidden on the former still visible on the linked device in a breach of user privacy. A future update could fix this because beta testers spotted chat lock on linked devices in April.\n\nFull Story WhatsApp's Chat Lock could soon get a linked devices upgrade Hide all your important chats, even on your secondary WhatsApp phone It's not all roses for WhatsApp\n\nWhile Meta developers have tested several new feature additions and UI changes, keeping the service running is critical for billions of users who rely on WhatsApp for everyday communications. Unfortunately, WhatsApp users saw a bug preventing the upload of video files recorded on their device or downloaded from the internet. The issue seemed widespread enough to bother users, but not so much so that it crippled the service for everyone. The company released a patch fixing this concern, so it should be back to business as usual for all affected users once you update the app from the Play Store.",

        "text": "AP\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Witness testimony in Donald Trump's criminal trial advanced on Tuesday with three people taking the stand, including Keith Davidson, a lawyer who previously represented Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal in hush money negotiations involving the former president.\n\nDavidson's testimony dominated the afternoon, highlighting his interactions with Trump's ex-lawyer Michael Cohen and detailing the lead-up to a deal that ultimately came with a $130,000 payment to Daniels.\n\nTuesday's proceedings, however, kicked off with the judge holding Trump in contempt and fining him $9,000 over nine online posts that he found violated a gag order barring the former president from speaking publicly about jurors and witnesses in the case.\n\nMerchan warned that if Trump does it again, he could be jailed.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Prosecutors say Trump obscured the true nature of those payments and falsely recorded them as legal expenses.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.\n\nThe case is the first-ever criminal trial of a former U.S. president and the first of four prosecutions of Trump to reach a jury.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- Key players: Who's who at Donald Trump's hush money criminal trial\n\n-- The hush money case is just one of Trump's legal cases. See the others here\n\n-- Read the judge's full order on Donald Trump's gag order violations\n\n-- Trump and DeSantis meet to make peace and discuss fundraising for the former president's campaign\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nTRUMP HITS OUT AT GAG ORDER AS COURT ADJOURNS FOR THE DAY\n\nDonald Trump complained about the gag order in his hush money trial, as well as other things as he left the courthouse Tuesday following the adjournment of the day's proceedings.\n\nThe former president approached news cameras in the courthouse hallway on his way out and hit on familiar themes, including accusing Judge Juan M. Merchan of bias and of rushing the case, and also saying he should be out campaigning.\n\nTrump was found in contempt of court earlier in the day and fined $9,000 for nine violations of the gag order, which bars him from speaking publicly about witnesses and jurors in the case.\n\nDAVIDSON SAYS HE THOUGHT DANIELS' STORY WOULD 'BE A TORNADO' IF IT GOT OUT\n\nKeith Davidson and Dylan Howard, then-editor of the National Enquirer, texted each other about what Howard called an \"impending storm\" of publicity if Stormy Daniels took her story elsewhere after Michael Cohen failed to make a payment in the deal on time, according to Davidson's testimony and documents shown at the trial on Tuesday.\n\nDavidson wrote to Howard that he believed Daniels and her agent had agreed to bring her story about a sexual encounter with Donald Trump to another publication, and \"I think it'll be a full-on blitz.\"\n\n\"I just felt like there was going to be more than a flurry of activity. I felt like it was going to be a tornado,\" Davidson explained in court.\n\n\"If the story got out,\" Steinglass asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Davidson said.\n\nAsked if Cohen ever told him who he was representing in the Daniels negotiations, Davidson said that he may not have explicitly stated he was working on Trump's behalf -- but the implication was clear.\n\nCOHEN MISSED DEADLINE TO PAY $130K TO STORMY DANIELS, DAVIDSON SAYS\n\nBefore a brief afternoon break in Donald Trump's hush money trial, lawyer Keith Davidson testified Tuesday that Michael Cohen missed an agreed upon deadline for sending a $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels.\n\nAt first, Cohen offered a litany of explanations for the delay, at turns blaming broken computers, Secret Service \"firewalls,\" and the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur. \"The things he was saying didn't really make sense,\" Davidson said of Cohen.\n\nAs the excuses piled up, Davidson said he understood that Cohen \"didn't have the authority to actually spend money.\" He eventually sent an email informing Cohen that the deal involving Daniel's story about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump was off.\n\n\"I thought he was trying to kick the can down the round until after the election,\" Davidson said.\n\nAPPELLATE COURT REJECTS TRUMP'S REQUEST TO STAY HUSH MONEY TRIAL\n\nAs testimony continued in Donald Trump's hush money trial on Tuesday, a five-judge panel in New York state's mid-level appellate court rejected the former president's request for a stay of the proceedings while he appeals several pretrial rulings, including the trial judge's refusal to recuse himself.\n\nTrump had sought the stay prior to the start of jury selection. A lone judge in the appeals court had previously rejected a request for an emergency stay halting the trial.\n\nPSEUDONYMS WERE USED TO DISGUISE PARTIES INVOLVED IN ENQUIRER DEAL, LAWYER TESTIFIES\n\nIn drawing up the deal with the National Enquirer involving Stormy Daniels' story about an alleged sexual encounter with Donald Trump, Keith Davidson testified Tuesday that he used pseudonyms to disguise the parties involved.\n\nStormy Daniels became Peggy Peterson and Donald Trump became David Dennison, according to Davidson.\n\nThe alliterative code names were picked, in part, because Daniels was the plaintiff and Trump was the defendant, the lawyer testified.\n\nAsked by prosecutors in Trump's hush money case if David Dennison was a real person, Davidson said that he played on his high school hockey team.\n\n\"And how does he feel about you now?\" asked prosecutor Josh Steinglass.\n\nDavidson stifled a laugh, then answered: \"He's very upset.\"\n\n'MICHAEL COHEN STEPPED INTO AMI'S SHOES,' DAVIDSON SAYS\n\nStormy Daniels' agent reached a six-figure deal with then-National Enquirer editor Dylan Howard for the tabloid to acquire the rights to her story about a sexual encounter with Donald Trump after his \"Access Hollywood\" tape leaked, Keith Davidson testified Tuesday.\n\nBut then, according to Davidson, Howard backed out.\n\nThe editor instead told Daniels' agent, Gina Rodriguez, to call Michael Cohen and complete the deal directly with him -- but she refused to speak with Cohen after an uncomfortable prior interaction.\n\nRodriguez asked Davidson to step in and negotiate the deal with Cohen, the lawyer testified.\n\nDavidson added that he had numerous interactions with Howard over the years regarding stories. Asked if it was unusual for Howard to direct him to make a deal with a third party like Cohen, Davidson responded: \"This is the only time that ever happened.\"\n\n\"In essence, Michael Cohen stepped into AMI's shoes,\" Davidson said, referring to the name of the Enquirer's parent company at the time, American Media Inc.\n\nDavidson testified that in negotiating with Cohen, he hiked the price to $130,000 -- building in his fee for his work on the deal.\n\n'ACCESS HOLLYWOOD' TAPE LEAK MADE DANIELS' STORY MORE MARKETABLE, LAWYER SAYS\n\nStormy Daniels' story about a sexual encounter with Donald Trump became more marketable after the notorious \"Access Hollywood\" tape was leaked, Keith Davidson testified on Tuesday.\n\nDavidson, who previously represented Daniels, told prosecutors that Daniels' agent, Gina Rodriguez, had been trying to drum up interest in her story earlier in the 2016 election cycle but found there wasn't much.\n\nAsked to describe the \"Access Hollywood\" tape, which can't be shown in court, Davidson testified that it involved Trump and the show's then-host Billy Bush being recorded on a \"hot mic\" and \"some statements by both men that were troublesome.\"\n\n'HE WAS JUST SCREAMING,' LAWYER TESTIFIES OF FIRST INTERACTION WITH COHEN\n\nKeith Davidson on Tuesday testified that his first interaction with Michael Cohen related to a 2011 post on a gossip blog that stated that porn actor Stormy Daniels and Trump had \"some sort of physical or romantic interaction.\"\n\nAfter the blog post was published, Davidson said, Daniels' agent Gina Rodriguez called him and said, \"some jerk called me and was very, very aggressive and threatened to sue me.\"\n\nAsked who the \"jerk\" was, Davidson said: \"Michael Cohen.\"\n\nDavidson testified that when he called Cohen, the ex-Trump lawyer greeted him \"with a hostile barrage of insults and insinuations that went on for quite a while.\"\n\n\"I don't think he was accusing us of anything, he was just screaming,\" Davidson continued. \"Finally, after he finished, I explained to him that I was calling because my client, Stormy Daniels, did not want the story up. I wanted to see if he had done anything\" to try to get the story taken down.\n\nDavidson said he eventually sent a cease-and-desist letter to the blog after the dust up with Cohen and the story was removed.\n\nDAVIDSON SAYS HE UNDERSTOOD THE ENQUIRER WOULD NEVER PUBLISH MCDOUGAL'S STORY\n\nLawyer Keith Davidson testified on Tuesday that back-and-forth haggling took place in the selling of former Playboy model Karen McDougal's story to the National Enquirer.\n\nIn one text message shown to jurors, Davidson told Enquirer editor Dylan Howard that \"they are asking me to go back for another 25,\" meaning another $25,000. Howard responds with an expletive, adding, \"Not my money. I'll ask.\"\n\nBut even as they reached a basic framework for the deal, Davidson described his \"growing frustration with the process.\" At one point, Davidson said he was pushed to call Donald Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen directly, something he said he had been trying to avoid.\n\n\"I thought it was odd, certainly,\" Davidson said about being asked to call Cohen. \"I didn't particularly like dealing with him and that's why I was trying like hell to avoid talking to him,\" he added.\n\nDavidson testified that he understood McDougal's story would never be published and acknowledged that \"there was an unspoken understanding that there was an affiliation between David Pecker and Donald Trump and that AMI wouldn't run this story, any story related to Karen, because it would hurt Donald Trump.\"\n\nTRUMP'S ONLINE POSTS FOUND TO VIOLATE GAG ORDER HAVE BEEN REMOVED\n\nDonald Trump's online posts that on Tuesday were found to violate a gag order barring him from speaking publicly about jurors and witnesses in his criminal hush money trial were removed ahead of an afternoon deadline.\n\nThe posts in question were deleted while the court was in recess for lunch.\n\nLinks to the old Truth Social posts redirected to a \"Not found\" message, while those on Trump's website redirected to a 404 error page.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Judge Juan M. Merchan fined the former president $9,000 for the nine posts for violating the order.\n\nTEXAS AG PAXTON AMONG THOSE IN COURTROOM AS TRUMP'S TRIAL RESUMES\n\nCourt in Donald Trump's criminal trial resumed Tuesday after an early afternoon lunch break.\n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton walked into the courtroom with Trump and his entourage after posting on social media earlier in the day that he was there to support the former president. The Republican sat down in the first row of the courtroom gallery directly behind the defense table.\n\nPaxton sat just a few seats away from Trump's son Eric, who sat near the aisle alongside Susie Wiles, a Trump political operative.\n\nKeith Davidson, a lawyer who previously represented former Playboy model Karen McDougal and porn actor Stormy Daniels in hush money negotiations, was expected to returned to the witness stand.\n\nDAVIDSON SHEDS LIGHT ON SEQUENCE OF EVENTS THAT LED TO THE DEAL WITH THE ENQUIRER\n\nKeith Davidson testified Tuesday that after tipping off a National Enquirer editor about \"a blockbuster Trump story,\" he soon arranged a meeting with that editor, former Playboy model Karen McDougal and others to see whether the Enquirer's then-parent company was interested.\n\nAfter flying back to New York, Howard told him the Enquirer wasn't keen \"because Karen McDougal lacked documentary evidence of the interaction,\" Davidson testified.\n\nMcDougal had alleged that she had a year-long affair with Donald Trump years earlier.\n\nA month later, Enquirer editor Dylan Howard reached out again to Davidson, suggesting they resume discussions.\n\nAt the time, Davidson warned that the Enquirer's parent company would need to move quickly, writing in one text: \"Time is of the essence. The girl is being cornered by the estrogen mafia\"\n\nDavidson testified that McDougal was \"teetering\" at the time he sent the message and on the verge of signing a deal to tell her story to ABC News.\n\nDavidson also testified that he played the National Enquirer and ABC News against each other to get the best deal for his client. McDougal didn't want to tell her story publicly, which would've been required if she went to ABC, he said.\n\nJURY SEES TEXTS FROM LAWYER PROMISING TABLOID EDITOR A 'BLOCKBUSTER TRUMP STORY'\n\nIn his court testimony on Tuesday, attorney Keith Davidson described representing Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model, in her allegations of a year-long affair with Donald Trump.\n\nAs questioning turned toward Davidson's involvement in some of the hush money deals at the heart of the former president's criminal trial, he said he met McDougal 25 years ago through a friend. He said he started representing in 2016 \"to provide advice and counsel as to what her rights and obligations would be regarding a personal interaction that she had.\"\n\n\"With whom?\" prosecutor Joshua Steinglass asked.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"Donald Trump.\"\n\nShortly after Davidson began representing McDougal, he said, he reached out to Dylan Howard, the editor in chief of the National Enquirer, promising a \"blockbuster Trump story.\"\n\nHoward replied soon after: \"I will get you more than ANYONE for it. You know why.\"\n\nAs the text messages were displayed on screens to the jury, Davidson testified that he didn't know exactly what Howard meant at the time. But, he noted, \"I knew that Dylan's boss David Pecker and Mr. Trump were longtime friends and had a former business relationship,\" he said, adding the tabloid had effectively \"endorsed Mr. Trump's candidacy.\"\n\nSTORMY DANIELS' FORMER LAWYER CALLED TO THE STAND\n\nA lawyer who previously represented former Playboy model Karen McDougal and porn actor Stormy Daniels was the next witness called to the stand in Donald Trump's hush money trial.\n\nKeith Davidson took the stand shortly after noon Tuesday and is known for representing people trying to sell celebrity sex tapes or other embarrassing information.\n\nHe represented McDougal and Daniels in hush money negotiations with the National Enquirer and Trump's then-lawyer Michael Cohen in 2016.\n\nMcDougal claimed she had had a yearlong affair with Trump in the mid-2000s. Daniels claimed she had a one-time sexual encounter with him in 2006. Trump has denied both allegations.\n\nEXECUTIVE CALLED TO THE STAND TO VERIFY TRANSCRIPT, VIDEO OF TRUMP DEPOSITION\n\nAn executive at a company that provides stenographers and videographers for depositions -- sworn, out-of-court statements under oath -- was the next witness called to the stand in Donald Trump's criminal trial on Tuesday.\n\nPhillip Thompson was called to authenticate a transcript and video of a deposition the former president gave in one of writer E. Jean Carroll's federal defamation lawsuits against him.\n\nThe portions included Carroll's lawyer asking Trump about his Truth Social platform, the dates of his marriage to wife Melania Trump and whether he was aware of the \"Access Hollywood\" tape.\n\nThe former longtime Elle magazine advice columnist had alleged that Trump sexually assaulted her in the 1990s and then defamed her after she came forward publicly in 2019. He has said nothing happened between the two of them and called her a \"wack job\" who engineered a \"hoax\" to sell a book.\n\nAfter two federal trials last year and this winter, juries awarded Carroll over $88 million. Trump is appealing.\n\nVIDEOS OF TRUMP DENYING ALLEGATIONS AND PRAISING COHEN PLAYED IN COURT\n\nProsecutors in Donald Trump's hush money case played C-SPAN clips on Tuesday of the then-presidential candidate on the campaign trail in the final weeks leading up to the 2016 election. In the videos, Trump forcefully denied allegations made by several women after his infamous 2005 \"Access Hollywood\" tape was made public.\n\n\"The stories are total fiction. They're 100% made up, they never happened, they never would happen,\" Trump said in video from an Oct. 14, 2016 rally in North Carolina.\n\nAnother clip played for the jury, from January 2017, showed Trump praising Michael Cohen as as good lawyer and friend.\n\nTrump did not appear to react in court to the clips, which were played on monitors throughout the courtroom, including directly in front of him on the defense table.\n\nAfter confirming the veracity of the clips, Robert Browning -- the executive director of C-SPAN's archives -- was dismissed from the witness stand. Trump's attorneys declined to question him.\n\nEXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF C-SPAN ARCHIVES CALLED TO THE STAND\n\nThe next witness called to the stand Tuesday in Donald Trump's hush money trial was Robert Browning, the executive director of the C-SPAN archives.\n\nBrowning, who manages the network's video collection, was called to verify the authenticity of video of a Trump campaign event.\n\nProsecutors are calling people who are regarded as \"records custodians\" to verify evidence in the former president's criminal case.\n\nTRIAL WILL BREAK FOR 4 DAYS OVER MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND\n\nDonald Trump's hush money trial will get an extra day off for the Memorial Day weekend next month.\n\nCourt won't be in session on Friday, May 24, to accommodate a juror who has a flight that morning, Judge Juan M. Merchan said on Tuesday.\n\nThat means the trial will be off for four straight days for the holiday weekend, resuming on Tuesday, May 28. Merchan also informed jurors there will not be court on May 17, though he didn't give them a reason.\n\nThat's the day Donald Trump will be attending his son Barron's high school graduation.\n\nPROSECUTORS WANT TO QUESTION TRUMP ABOUT GAG ORDER VIOLATIONS IF HE TESTIFIES\n\nAhead of a midday break in Donald Trump's hush money case, prosecutors asked the judge to let them question the former president about his gag order violations should he choose to testify.\n\nThe request came after Judge Juan M. Merchan ruled Tuesday morning that Trump had on nine occasions violated a court mandate barring him from speaking publicly about witnesses and jurors in the case. He ultimately fined Trump $9,000 and will hold another hearing Thursday on four more alleged gag order violations.\n\nProsecutors also requested permission to introduce evidence they said shows Trump orchestrated a \"pressure campaign and intimidation effort\" against Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels.\n\nColangelo said Trump's attorney opened the door to that evidence by seeking to undermine the credibility of the two witnesses in opening statements.\n\nMerchan did not immediately rule, but said, \"the door has been opened.\"\n\nHe previously ruled to allow prosecutors to challenge Trump's credibility by questioning him about a limited number of his recent legal setbacks if he ends up taking the witness stand.\n\nTrump has said he wants to testify, but is under no obligation to do so.\n\nNO RED FLAGS ABOUT COHEN'S ACCOUNTS AT THE TIME, FARRO SAYS\n\nIn his cross examination of banker Gary Farro on Tuesday, defense attorney Todd Blanche underscored that Michael Cohen made no mention that the accounts he opened in October 2016 had anything to do with deals involving then-presidential candidate Donald Trump or his company.\n\nIf Cohen had done so, \"I would have asked questions,\" Farro said.\n\nFarro noted that he might not have opened a bank account for Cohen if he'd been told it was for what's known as a shell corporation -- one that receives and sends out money but doesn't have an underlying business.\n\nBut Cohen, the banker said, told him the account was for a real estate consulting business.\n\nNothing about it raised \"any red flags to you?\" Blanche asked.\n\n\"Not based upon the answers I was given to the questions I asked,\" Farro said.\n\nFarro's testimony shed light on his role in helping Cohen open a bank account that was later used to process a $130,000 wire transfer to a lawyer for Stormy Daniels.\n\nDEFENSE BEGINS CROSS-EXAMINATION OF FARRO\n\nDefense attorneys began their cross-examination of Gary Farro, the prosecution's third witness in Donald Trump's hush money trial, by asking the banker to describe his relationship with Michael Cohen.\n\nFarro said he first met Cohen -- then serving as the former president's personal lawyer -- in person at a meeting in Trump Tower, but primarily communicated over the phone. Pushed by Todd Blanche, Farro acknowledged that Cohen wasn't always easy to work with.\n\n\"He was a challenging client because of his desire to get things done so quickly,\" Farro said. \"Ninety percent of the time it was an urgent matter.\"\n\nPROSECUTORS WRAP QUESTIONING OF FARRO\n\nProsecutors have wrapped up questioning of Gary Farro, their third witness in Donald Trump's criminal hush money trial.\n\nFarro told prosecutors on Tuesday that Michael Cohen had indicated that a 2016 $130,000 wire payment now at the heart of the case was related to a real estate transaction -- not a political candidate, an adult film performer or buying up a potential media story.\n\n\"We might consider something like that a reputational risk,\" Farro said.\n\nWithin a day of opening the Essential Consultants LLC bank account on Oct. 26, 2016 -- and funding it with about $130,000 from his own home equity loan -- Cohen wired out $130,000 to Keith Davidson, then a lawyer for Stormy Daniels, documents showed.\n\nThe 2016 presidential election was on Nov. 8.\n\nFAMILY JOINS TRUMP IN COURT FOR THE FIRST TIME\n\nDonald Trump's son Eric joined his father in court on Tuesday, marking the first time any of the former president's family members have attended his criminal hush money trial.\n\nPrior to court proceedings resuming, Trump turned from the defense table and walked over to his son in the first row of the gallery. Trump put his hand on Eric's arm as they chatted.\n\nTrump had railed about the trial, as well as his other legal cases, to reporters on his way into the courtroom earlier in the morning.\n\nFARRO RETURNS TO THE STAND\n\nTestimony in Donald Trump's hush money trial resumed with Gary Farro, a banker who helped Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen open accounts. Cohen used one such account to buy the silence of porn performer Stormy Daniels in the weeks before the 2016 election. She alleged a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump, which he denies.\n\nCohen indicated the account, opened in late October 2016 in the name of Essential Consultants LLC, would be used for real estate consulting, according to testimony and documents shown at the trial.\n\nIn response to prosecutor Becky Mangold's questions, Farro said the bank would have asked more questions if there had been any mention of a connection to a political candidate, buying a story that was being pitched to the media or paying a porn performer.\n\nThe additional scrutiny would have delayed or even nixed opening the account, which Cohen had wanted to open right away. In particular, the adult film world \"is an industry we don't work with,\" he said.\n\nWith only real estate in the picture, the account was opened within a day -- \"very quick,\" Farro said.\n\nMERCHAN FINDS POST ABOUT COHEN AND DANIELS WAS NOT A VIOLATION\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan found that one of Donald Trump's online posts about his former lawyer Michael Cohen and porn actor Stormy Daniels did not violate a gag order barring him from speaking publicly about jurors and witnesses in his hush money case.\n\nMerchan wrote that he was finding Trump \"in criminal contempt for willfully disobeying a lawful mandate\" of the court on nine separate occasions for posts made on Truth Social and his campaign website.\n\nMerchan ruled that Trump's April 10 post referring to Cohen and Daniels as \"sleaze bags\" was not a gag order violation. He said Trump's contention that he was responding to previous posts by Cohen \"is sufficient to give\" him pause \"as to whether the People have met their burden\" as to that post.\n\nHowever, the other nine \"attack the credibility of arguably two of the more high-profile witnesses in this case.\"\n\n\"To allow such attacks upon protected witnesses with blanket assertions that they are all responses to 'political attacks' would be an exception that swallowed the rule. The Expanded Order does not contain such an exception,\" Merchan wrote.\n\nJUDGE FINDS TRUMP VIOLATED GAG ORDER, FINES HIM $9K\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan ruled Tuesday morning that Donald Trump violated a gag order barring him from making public statements about witnesses and jurors in his hush money trial nine times. He fined the former president $9,000 for the violations.\n\nProsecutors had alleged the former president had violated the order 10 times, and Merchan concurred in all but one of those instances. The judge will hold a hearing Thursday on four more alleged violations.\n\nThe former president stared down at the table in front of him as Merchan read the ruling, frowning slightly but otherwise showing no expression.\n\nMerchan wrote in his ruling that Trump \"is hereby warned that the Court will not tolerate continued willful violations of its lawful orders\" and raised the possibility of jail time if \"necessary and appropriate under the circumstances.\"\n\nJUDGE TO ALLOW TRUMP TO ATTEND SON'S GRADUATION\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan said Tuesday morning that Donald Trump's criminal hush money trial will not be held on May 17 so that the former president can attend his son's graduation.\n\n\"I don't think the May 17 date is a problem, so Mr. Trump can certainly attend that date, attend his son's graduation,\" Merchan said.\n\nTrump had previously requested the day off from court to accommodate his son Barron's high school graduation.\n\nTRUMP ARRIVES AT COURT\n\nDonald Trump's motorcade arrived Tuesday morning at the courthouse in lower Manhattan just before 9 a.m., kicking off the second week of witness testimony in the former president's hush money trial.\n\nA crowd of around 60 Trump supporters had gathered across the street from the building, waving Trump and American flags on tall poles.\n\nTRUMP LEAVES TRUMP TOWER FOR COURT\n\nDonald Trump entered his motorcade outside Trump Tower in midtown, headed to the courthouse in lower Manhattan for the second week of trial testimony.\n\nThe former president on Tuesday will be in court for testimony from the third prosecution witness, Gary Farro, a banker who helped Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen open accounts.\n\nCohen used one to buy the silence of porn performer Stormy Daniels. She alleged a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump, which he denies.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Universally compatible, it works with just about any gadget, including Apple and Android phones and tablets. Right now, this pocket-size savior has dropped to an electrifyingly low price at Amazon.\n\nYou can get two of these chargers for this price. That's just ridiculous -- $8 apiece! That's over 45% off. You'd pay $20 or more for a single power bank from brands like Anker or Iniu, which makes snagging this deal a no-brainer.\n\nEach Loveledi power bank packs a lot of juice into its half-inch-thick frame. The battery provides about four or five full charges for your iPhone. (The Pro series of certain iPhones has larger batteries and may get only three charges.)

Prosecutors say Trump obscured the true nature of those payments and falsely recorded them as legal expenses.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.\n\nThe case is the first-ever criminal trial of a former U.S. president and the first of four prosecutions of Trump to reach a jury.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- Key players: Who's who at Donald Trump's hush money criminal trial\n\n-- The hush money case is just one of Trump's legal cases. See the others here\n\n-- Read the judge's full order on Donald Trump's gag order violations\n\n-- Trump and DeSantis meet to make peace and discuss fundraising for the former president's campaign\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nTRUMP HITS OUT AT GAG ORDER AS COURT ADJOURNS FOR THE DAY\n\nDonald Trump complained about the gag order in his hush money trial, as well as other things as he left the courthouse Tuesday following the adjournment of the day's proceedings.\n\nThe former president approached news cameras in the courthouse hallway on his way out and hit on familiar themes, including accusing Judge Juan M. Merchan of bias and of rushing the case, and also saying he should be out campaigning.\n\nTrump was found in contempt of court earlier in the day and fined $9,000 for nine violations of the gag order, which bars him from speaking publicly about witnesses and jurors in the case.\n\nDAVIDSON SAYS HE THOUGHT DANIELS' STORY WOULD 'BE A TORNADO' IF IT GOT OUT\n\nKeith Davidson and Dylan Howard, then-editor of the National Enquirer, texted each other about what Howard called an \"impending storm\" of publicity if Stormy Daniels took her story elsewhere after Michael Cohen failed to make a payment in the deal on time, according to Davidson's testimony and documents shown at the trial on Tuesday.\n\nDavidson wrote to Howard that he believed Daniels and her agent had agreed to bring her story about a sexual encounter with Donald Trump to another publication, and \"I think it'll be a full-on blitz.\"\n\n\"I just felt like there was going to be more than a flurry of activity. I felt like it was going to be a tornado,\" Davidson explained in court.\n\n\"If the story got out,\" Steinglass asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Davidson said.\n\nAsked if Cohen ever told him who he was representing in the Daniels negotiations, Davidson said that he may not have explicitly stated he was working on Trump's behalf -- but the implication was clear.\n\nCOHEN MISSED DEADLINE TO PAY $130K TO STORMY DANIELS, DAVIDSON SAYS\n\nBefore a brief afternoon break in Donald Trump's hush money trial, lawyer Keith Davidson testified Tuesday that Michael Cohen missed an agreed upon deadline for sending a $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels.\n\nAt first, Cohen offered a litany of explanations for the delay, at turns blaming broken computers, Secret Service \"firewalls,\" and the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur. \"The things he was saying didn't really make sense,\" Davidson said of Cohen.\n\nAs the excuses piled up, Davidson said he understood that Cohen \"didn't have the authority to actually spend money.\" He eventually sent an email informing Cohen that the deal involving Daniel's story about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump was off.\n\n\"I thought he was trying to kick the can down the round until after the election,\" Davidson said.\n\nAPPELLATE COURT REJECTS TRUMP'S REQUEST TO STAY HUSH MONEY TRIAL\n\nAs testimony continued in Donald Trump's hush money trial on Tuesday, a five-judge panel in New York state's mid-level appellate court rejected the former president's request for a stay of the proceedings while he appeals several pretrial rulings, including the trial judge's refusal to recuse himself.\n\nTrump had sought the stay prior to the start of jury selection. A lone judge in the appeals court had previously rejected a request for an emergency stay halting the trial.\n\nPSEUDONYMS WERE USED TO DISGUISE PARTIES INVOLVED IN ENQUIRER DEAL, LAWYER TESTIFIES\n\nIn drawing up the deal with the National Enquirer involving Stormy Daniels' story about an alleged sexual encounter with Donald Trump, Keith Davidson testified Tuesday that he used pseudonyms to disguise the parties involved.\n\nStormy Daniels became Peggy Peterson and Donald Trump became David Dennison, according to Davidson.\n\nThe alliterative code names were picked, in part, because Daniels was the plaintiff and Trump was the defendant, the lawyer testified.\n\nAsked by prosecutors in Trump's hush money case if David Dennison was a real person, Davidson said that he played on his high school hockey team.\n\n\"And how does he feel about you now?\" asked prosecutor Josh Steinglass.\n\nDavidson stifled a laugh, then answered: \"He's very upset.\"\n\n'MICHAEL COHEN STEPPED INTO AMI'S SHOES,' DAVIDSON SAYS\n\nStormy Daniels' agent reached a six-figure deal with then-National Enquirer editor Dylan Howard for the tabloid to acquire the rights to her story about a sexual encounter with Donald Trump after his \"Access Hollywood\" tape leaked, Keith Davidson testified Tuesday.\n\nBut then, according to Davidson, Howard backed out.\n\nThe editor instead told Daniels' agent, Gina Rodriguez, to call Michael Cohen and complete the deal directly with him -- but she refused to speak with Cohen after an uncomfortable prior interaction.\n\nRodriguez asked Davidson to step in and negotiate the deal with Cohen, the lawyer testified.\n\nDavidson added that he had numerous interactions with Howard over the years regarding stories. Asked if it was unusual for Howard to direct him to make a deal with a third party like Cohen, Davidson responded: \"This is the only time that ever happened.\"\n\n\"In essence, Michael Cohen stepped into AMI's shoes,\" Davidson said, referring to the name of the Enquirer's parent company at the time, American Media Inc.\n\nDavidson testified that in negotiating with Cohen, he hiked the price to $130,000 -- building in his fee for his work on the deal.\n\n'ACCESS HOLLYWOOD' TAPE LEAK MADE DANIELS' STORY MORE MARKETABLE, LAWYER SAYS\n\nStormy Daniels' story about a sexual encounter with Donald Trump became more marketable after the notorious \"Access Hollywood\" tape was leaked, Keith Davidson testified on Tuesday.\n\nDavidson, who previously represented Daniels, told prosecutors that Daniels' agent, Gina Rodriguez, had been trying to drum up interest in her story earlier in the 2016 election cycle but found there wasn't much.\n\nAsked to describe the \"Access Hollywood\" tape, which can't be shown in court, Davidson testified that it involved Trump and the show's then-host Billy Bush being recorded on a \"hot mic\" and \"some statements by both men that were troublesome.\"\n\n'HE WAS JUST SCREAMING,' LAWYER TESTIFIES OF FIRST INTERACTION WITH COHEN\n\nKeith Davidson on Tuesday testified that his first interaction with Michael Cohen related to a 2011 post on a gossip blog that stated that porn actor Stormy Daniels and Trump had \"some sort of physical or romantic interaction.\"\n\nAfter the blog post was published, Davidson said, Daniels' agent Gina Rodriguez called him and said, \"some jerk called me and was very, very aggressive and threatened to sue me.\"\n\nAsked who the \"jerk\" was, Davidson said: \"Michael Cohen.\"\n\nDavidson testified that when he called Cohen, the ex-Trump lawyer greeted him \"with a hostile barrage of insults and insinuations that went on for quite a while.\"\n\n\"I don't think he was accusing us of anything, he was just screaming,\" Davidson continued. \"Finally, after he finished, I explained to him that I was calling because my client, Stormy Daniels, did not want the story up. I wanted to see if he had done anything\" to try to get the story taken down.\n\nDavidson said he eventually sent a cease-and-desist letter to the blog after the dust up with Cohen and the story was removed.\n\nDAVIDSON SAYS HE UNDERSTOOD THE ENQUIRER WOULD NEVER PUBLISH MCDOUGAL'S STORY\n\nLawyer Keith Davidson testified on Tuesday that back-and-forth haggling took place in the selling of former Playboy model Karen McDougal's story to the National Enquirer.\n\nIn one text message shown to jurors, Davidson told Enquirer editor Dylan Howard that \"they are asking me to go back for another 25,\" meaning another $25,000. Howard responds with an expletive, adding, \"Not my money. I'll ask.\"\n\nBut even as they reached a basic framework for the deal, Davidson described his \"growing frustration with the process.\" At one point, Davidson said he was pushed to call Donald Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen directly, something he said he had been trying to avoid.\n\n\"I thought it was odd, certainly,\" Davidson said about being asked to call Cohen. \"I didn't particularly like dealing with him and that's why I was trying like hell to avoid talking to him,\" he added.\n\nDavidson testified that he understood McDougal's story would never be published and acknowledged that \"there was an unspoken understanding that there was an affiliation between David Pecker and Donald Trump and that AMI wouldn't run this story, any story related to Karen, because it would hurt Donald Trump.\"\n\nTRUMP'S ONLINE POSTS FOUND TO VIOLATE GAG ORDER HAVE BEEN REMOVED\n\nDonald Trump's online posts that on Tuesday were found to violate a gag order barring him from speaking publicly about jurors and witnesses in his criminal hush money trial were removed ahead of an afternoon deadline.\n\nThe posts in question were deleted while the court was in recess for lunch.\n\nLinks to the old Truth Social posts redirected to a \"Not found\" message, while those on Trump's website redirected to a 404 error page.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Judge Juan M. Merchan fined the former president $9,000 for the nine posts for violating the order.\n\nTEXAS AG PAXTON AMONG THOSE IN COURTROOM AS TRUMP'S TRIAL RESUMES\n\nCourt in Donald Trump's criminal trial resumed Tuesday after an early afternoon lunch break.\n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton walked into the courtroom with Trump and his entourage after posting on social media earlier in the day that he was there to support the former president. The Republican sat down in the first row of the courtroom gallery directly behind the defense table.\n\nPaxton sat just a few seats away from Trump's son Eric, who sat near the aisle alongside Susie Wiles, a Trump political operative.\n\nKeith Davidson, a lawyer who previously represented former Playboy model Karen McDougal and porn actor Stormy Daniels in hush money negotiations, was expected to returned to the witness stand.\n\nDAVIDSON SHEDS LIGHT ON SEQUENCE OF EVENTS THAT LED TO THE DEAL WITH THE ENQUIRER\n\nKeith Davidson testified Tuesday that after tipping off a National Enquirer editor about \"a blockbuster Trump story,\" he soon arranged a meeting with that editor, former Playboy model Karen McDougal and others to see whether the Enquirer's then-parent company was interested.\n\nAfter flying back to New York, Howard told him the Enquirer wasn't keen \"because Karen McDougal lacked documentary evidence of the interaction,\" Davidson testified.\n\nMcDougal had alleged that she had a year-long affair with Donald Trump years earlier.\n\nA month later, Enquirer editor Dylan Howard reached out again to Davidson, suggesting they resume discussions.\n\nAt the time, Davidson warned that the Enquirer's parent company would need to move quickly, writing in one text: \"Time is of the essence. The girl is being cornered by the estrogen mafia\"\n\nDavidson testified that McDougal was \"teetering\" at the time he sent the message and on the verge of signing a deal to tell her story to ABC News.\n\nDavidson also testified that he played the National Enquirer and ABC News against each other to get the best deal for his client. McDougal didn't want to tell her story publicly, which would've been required if she went to ABC, he said.\n\nJURY SEES TEXTS FROM LAWYER PROMISING TABLOID EDITOR A 'BLOCKBUSTER TRUMP STORY'\n\nIn his court testimony on Tuesday, attorney Keith Davidson described representing Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model, in her allegations of a year-long affair with Donald Trump.\n\nAs questioning turned toward Davidson's involvement in some of the hush money deals at the heart of the former president's criminal trial, he said he met McDougal 25 years ago through a friend. He said he started representing in 2016 \"to provide advice and counsel as to what her rights and obligations would be regarding a personal interaction that she had.\"\n\n\"With whom?\" prosecutor Joshua Steinglass asked.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"Donald Trump.\"\n\nShortly after Davidson began representing McDougal, he said, he reached out to Dylan Howard, the editor in chief of the National Enquirer, promising a \"blockbuster Trump story.\"\n\nHoward replied soon after: \"I will get you more than ANYONE for it. You know why.\"\n\nAs the text messages were displayed on screens to the jury, Davidson testified that he didn't know exactly what Howard meant at the time. But, he noted, \"I knew that Dylan's boss David Pecker and Mr. Trump were longtime friends and had a former business relationship,\" he said, adding the tabloid had effectively \"endorsed Mr. Trump's candidacy.\"\n\nSTORMY DANIELS' FORMER LAWYER CALLED TO THE STAND\n\nA lawyer who previously represented former Playboy model Karen McDougal and porn actor Stormy Daniels was the next witness called to the stand in Donald Trump's hush money trial.\n\nKeith Davidson took the stand shortly after noon Tuesday and is known for representing people trying to sell celebrity sex tapes or other embarrassing information.\n\nHe represented McDougal and Daniels in hush money negotiations with the National Enquirer and Trump's then-lawyer Michael Cohen in 2016.\n\nMcDougal claimed she had had a yearlong affair with Trump in the mid-2000s. Daniels claimed she had a one-time sexual encounter with him in 2006. Trump has denied both allegations.\n\nEXECUTIVE CALLED TO THE STAND TO VERIFY TRANSCRIPT, VIDEO OF TRUMP DEPOSITION\n\nAn executive at a company that provides stenographers and videographers for depositions -- sworn, out-of-court statements under oath -- was the next witness called to the stand in Donald Trump's criminal trial on Tuesday.\n\nPhillip Thompson was called to authenticate a transcript and video of a deposition the former president gave in one of writer E. Jean Carroll's federal defamation lawsuits against him.\n\nThe portions included Carroll's lawyer asking Trump about his Truth Social platform, the dates of his marriage to wife Melania Trump and whether he was aware of the \"Access Hollywood\" tape.\n\nThe former longtime Elle magazine advice columnist had alleged that Trump sexually assaulted her in the 1990s and then defamed her after she came forward publicly in 2019. He has said nothing happened between the two of them and called her a \"wack job\" who engineered a \"hoax\" to sell a book.\n\nAfter two federal trials last year and this winter, juries awarded Carroll over $88 million. Trump is appealing.\n\nVIDEOS OF TRUMP DENYING ALLEGATIONS AND PRAISING COHEN PLAYED IN COURT\n\nProsecutors in Donald Trump's hush money case played C-SPAN clips on Tuesday of the then-presidential candidate on the campaign trail in the final weeks leading up to the 2016 election. In the videos, Trump forcefully denied allegations made by several women after his infamous 2005 \"Access Hollywood\" tape was made public.\n\n\"The stories are total fiction. They're 100% made up, they never happened, they never would happen,\" Trump said in video from an Oct. 14, 2016 rally in North Carolina.\n\nAnother clip played for the jury, from January 2017, showed Trump praising Michael Cohen as as good lawyer and friend.\n\nTrump did not appear to react in court to the clips, which were played on monitors throughout the courtroom, including directly in front of him on the defense table.\n\nAfter confirming the veracity of the clips, Robert Browning -- the executive director of C-SPAN's archives -- was dismissed from the witness stand. Trump's attorneys declined to question him.\n\nEXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF C-SPAN ARCHIVES CALLED TO THE STAND\n\nThe next witness called to the stand Tuesday in Donald Trump's hush money trial was Robert Browning, the executive director of the C-SPAN archives.\n\nBrowning, who manages the network's video collection, was called to verify the authenticity of video of a Trump campaign event.\n\nProsecutors are calling people who are regarded as \"records custodians\" to verify evidence in the former president's criminal case.\n\nTRIAL WILL BREAK FOR 4 DAYS OVER MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND\n\nDonald Trump's hush money trial will get an extra day off for the Memorial Day weekend next month.\n\nCourt won't be in session on Friday, May 24, to accommodate a juror who has a flight that morning, Judge Juan M. Merchan said on Tuesday.\n\nThat means the trial will be off for four straight days for the holiday weekend, resuming on Tuesday, May 28. Merchan also informed jurors there will not be court on May 17, though he didn't give them a reason.\n\nThat's the day Donald Trump will be attending his son Barron's high school graduation.\n\nPROSECUTORS WANT TO QUESTION TRUMP ABOUT GAG ORDER VIOLATIONS IF HE TESTIFIES\n\nAhead of a midday break in Donald Trump's hush money case, prosecutors asked the judge to let them question the former president about his gag order violations should he choose to testify.\n\nThe request came after Judge Juan M. Merchan ruled Tuesday morning that Trump had on nine occasions violated a court mandate barring him from speaking publicly about witnesses and jurors in the case. He ultimately fined Trump $9,000 and will hold another hearing Thursday on four more alleged gag order violations.\n\nProsecutors also requested permission to introduce evidence they said shows Trump orchestrated a \"pressure campaign and intimidation effort\" against Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels.\n\nColangelo said Trump's attorney opened the door to that evidence by seeking to undermine the credibility of the two witnesses in opening statements.\n\nMerchan did not immediately rule, but said, \"the door has been opened.\"\n\nHe previously ruled to allow prosecutors to challenge Trump's credibility by questioning him about a limited number of his recent legal setbacks if he ends up taking the witness stand.\n\nTrump has said he wants to testify, but is under no obligation to do so.\n\nNO RED FLAGS ABOUT COHEN'S ACCOUNTS AT THE TIME, FARRO SAYS\n\nIn his cross examination of banker Gary Farro on Tuesday, defense attorney Todd Blanche underscored that Michael Cohen made no mention that the accounts he opened in October 2016 had anything to do with deals involving then-presidential candidate Donald Trump or his company.\n\nIf Cohen had done so, \"I would have asked questions,\" Farro said.\n\nFarro noted that he might not have opened a bank account for Cohen if he'd been told it was for what's known as a shell corporation -- one that receives and sends out money but doesn't have an underlying business.\n\nBut Cohen, the banker said, told him the account was for a real estate consulting business.\n\nNothing about it raised \"any red flags to you?\" Blanche asked.\n\n\"Not based upon the answers I was given to the questions I asked,\" Farro said.\n\nFarro's testimony shed light on his role in helping Cohen open a bank account that was later used to process a $130,000 wire transfer to a lawyer for Stormy Daniels.\n\nDEFENSE BEGINS CROSS-EXAMINATION OF FARRO\n\nDefense attorneys began their cross-examination of Gary Farro, the prosecution's third witness in Donald Trump's hush money trial, by asking the banker to describe his relationship with Michael Cohen.\n\nFarro said he first met Cohen -- then serving as the former president's personal lawyer -- in person at a meeting in Trump Tower, but primarily communicated over the phone. Pushed by Todd Blanche, Farro acknowledged that Cohen wasn't always easy to work with.\n\n\"He was a challenging client because of his desire to get things done so quickly,\" Farro said. \"Ninety percent of the time it was an urgent matter.\"\n\nPROSECUTORS WRAP QUESTIONING OF FARRO\n\nProsecutors have wrapped up questioning of Gary Farro, their third witness in Donald Trump's criminal hush money trial.\n\nFarro told prosecutors on Tuesday that Michael Cohen had indicated that a 2016 $130,000 wire payment now at the heart of the case was related to a real estate transaction -- not a political candidate, an adult film performer or buying up a potential media story.\n\n\"We might consider something like that a reputational risk,\" Farro said.\n\nWithin a day of opening the Essential Consultants LLC bank account on Oct. 26, 2016 -- and funding it with about $130,000 from his own home equity loan -- Cohen wired out $130,000 to Keith Davidson, then a lawyer for Stormy Daniels, documents showed.\n\nThe 2016 presidential election was on Nov. 8.\n\nFAMILY JOINS TRUMP IN COURT FOR THE FIRST TIME\n\nDonald Trump's son Eric joined his father in court on Tuesday, marking the first time any of the former president's family members have attended his criminal hush money trial.\n\nPrior to court proceedings resuming, Trump turned from the defense table and walked over to his son in the first row of the gallery. Trump put his hand on Eric's arm as they chatted.\n\nTrump had railed about the trial, as well as his other legal cases, to reporters on his way into the courtroom earlier in the morning.\n\nFARRO RETURNS TO THE STAND\n\nTestimony in Donald Trump's hush money trial resumed with Gary Farro, a banker who helped Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen open accounts. Cohen used one such account to buy the silence of porn performer Stormy Daniels in the weeks before the 2016 election. She alleged a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump, which he denies.\n\nCohen indicated the account, opened in late October 2016 in the name of Essential Consultants LLC, would be used for real estate consulting, according to testimony and documents shown at the trial.\n\nIn response to prosecutor Becky Mangold's questions, Farro said the bank would have asked more questions if there had been any mention of a connection to a political candidate, buying a story that was being pitched to the media or paying a porn performer.\n\nThe additional scrutiny would have delayed or even nixed opening the account, which Cohen had wanted to open right away. In particular, the adult film world \"is an industry we don't work with,\" he said.\n\nWith only real estate in the picture, the account was opened within a day -- \"very quick,\" Farro said.\n\nMERCHAN FINDS POST ABOUT COHEN AND DANIELS WAS NOT A VIOLATION\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan found that one of Donald Trump's online posts about his former lawyer Michael Cohen and porn actor Stormy Daniels did not violate a gag order barring him from speaking publicly about jurors and witnesses in his hush money case.\n\nMerchan wrote that he was finding Trump \"in criminal contempt for willfully disobeying a lawful mandate\" of the court on nine separate occasions for posts made on Truth Social and his campaign website.\n\nMerchan ruled that Trump's April 10 post referring to Cohen and Daniels as \"sleaze bags\" was not a gag order violation. He said Trump's contention that he was responding to previous posts by Cohen \"is sufficient to give\" him pause \"as to whether the People have met their burden\" as to that post.\n\nHowever, the other nine \"attack the credibility of arguably two of the more high-profile witnesses in this case.\"\n\n\"To allow such attacks upon protected witnesses with blanket assertions that they are all responses to 'political attacks' would be an exception that swallowed the rule. The Expanded Order does not contain such an exception,\" Merchan wrote.\n\nJUDGE FINDS TRUMP VIOLATED GAG ORDER, FINES HIM $9K\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan ruled Tuesday morning that Donald Trump violated a gag order barring him from making public statements about witnesses and jurors in his hush money trial nine times. He fined the former president $9,000 for the violations.\n\nProsecutors had alleged the former president had violated the order 10 times, and Merchan concurred in all but one of those instances. The judge will hold a hearing Thursday on four more alleged violations.\n\nThe former president stared down at the table in front of him as Merchan read the ruling, frowning slightly but otherwise showing no expression.\n\nMerchan wrote in his ruling that Trump \"is hereby warned that the Court will not tolerate continued willful violations of its lawful orders\" and raised the possibility of jail time if \"necessary and appropriate under the circumstances.\"\n\nJUDGE TO ALLOW TRUMP TO ATTEND SON'S GRADUATION\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan said Tuesday morning that Donald Trump's criminal hush money trial will not be held on May 17 so that the former president can attend his son's graduation.\n\n\"I don't think the May 17 date is a problem, so Mr. Trump can certainly attend that date, attend his son's graduation,\" Merchan said.\n\nTrump had previously requested the day off from court to accommodate his son Barron's high school graduation.\n\nTRUMP ARRIVES AT COURT\n\nDonald Trump's motorcade arrived Tuesday morning at the courthouse in lower Manhattan just before 9 a.m., kicking off the second week of witness testimony in the former president's hush money trial.\n\nA crowd of around 60 Trump supporters had gathered across the street from the building, waving Trump and American flags on tall poles.\n\nTRUMP LEAVES TRUMP TOWER FOR COURT\n\nDonald Trump entered his motorcade outside Trump Tower in midtown, headed to the courthouse in lower Manhattan for the second week of trial testimony.\n\nThe former president on Tuesday will be in court for testimony from the third prosecution witness, Gary Farro, a banker who helped Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen open accounts.\n\nCohen used one to buy the silence of porn performer Stormy Daniels. She alleged a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump, which he denies.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

We are making steady progress on the restructuring plan announced in January to optimize our manufacturing and distribution footprint and remain on track to achieve our objectives within our stated timeline.\"\n\nFounded in 1883, Leggett & Platt (NYSE:LEG) is a diversified manufacturer making products for various industries.\n\nA healthy housing market is good for furniture demand as more consumers are buying, renting, moving, and renovating. On the other hand, periods of economic weakness or high interest rates discourage home sales and can squelch demand. In addition, home furnishing companies must contend with shifting consumer preferences such as the growing propensity to buy goods online, including big things like mattresses and sofas that were once thought to be immune from e-commerce competition.\n\nA company's long-term performance can give signals about its business quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but many enduring ones muster years of growth. Leggett & Platt's revenue was flat over the last five years. Within consumer discretionary, product cycles are short and revenue can be hit-driven due to rapidly changing trends. That's why we also follow short-term performance. Leggett & Platt's recent history shows a reversal from its five-year trend as its revenue has shown annualized declines of 6.3% over the last two years.\n\nWe can better understand the company's revenue dynamics by analyzing its three most important segments: Bedding, FF&T, and Specialized Products, which are 40.8%, 30.4%, and 28.8% of revenue. Over the last two years, Leggett & Platt's Bedding (mattresses and foundations) and FF&T (sofa parts and tiles ) revenues averaged year-on-year declines of 14% and 6.9% while Specialized Products (automobile components) averaged 13% growth.\n\nThis quarter, Leggett & Platt missed Wall Street's estimates and reported a rather uninspiring 9.6% year-on-year revenue decline, generating $1.10 billion of revenue. Looking ahead, Wall Street expects revenue to decline 2% over the next 12 months.\n\nToday's young investors won't have read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.\n\nAlthough earnings are undoubtedly valuable for assessing company performance, we believe cash is king because you can't use accounting profits to pay the bills.\n\nOver the last two years, Leggett & Platt has shown mediocre cash profitability, putting it in a pinch as it gives the company limited opportunities to reinvest, pay down debt, or return capital to shareholders. Its free cash flow margin has averaged 7%, subpar for a consumer discretionary business.\n\nLeggett & Platt burned through $32 million of cash in Q1, equivalent to a negative 2.9% margin. This caught our eye as the company shifted from cash flow positive in the same quarter last year to cash flow negative this quarter.\n\nWe struggled to find many strong positives in these results as its revenue and EPS fell short of Wall Street's estimates. The company stated its underperformance stemmed from weak demand in its residential end markets. Additionally, operating cash flows were negative $6 million, down from $103 million in Q1 2023. This was primarily driven by lower accounts payable and earnings.\n\nLooking ahead, the company reconfirmed its revenue guidance for the full year, but its earnings forecast missed. Overall, this was a bad quarter for Leggett & Platt. The company is down 8.7% on the results and currently trades at $16.5 per share.\n\nLeggett & Platt may have had a tough quarter, but does that actually create an opportunity to invest right now? When making that decision, it's important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter. We cover that in our actionable full research report which you can read here, it's free.",

Download the app on Apple and Google Play.\n\nLos Angeles District Attorney George Gascón has abandoned victims while he fuels a culture of lawlessness. Some may call this unethical, so it's no surprise that his assistant attorney in charge of all things ethics may also be unethical.\n\nAssistant Diana Teran is being charged with 11 felonies for allegedly looking up confidential information about deputies and taking it with her when she went off to work with her buddy Gascón.\n\nLeft-wing Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascon's right-hand woman is facing nearly 11 felony charges after state prosecutors say she helped herself to confidential information about 11 deputies as far back as 2018 and took it with her when she left the sheriff's office to work for the DA three years later.\n\nDiana Teran is accused of accessing a sheriff's office database about its deputies when she worked there and then taking that information with her to the district attorney's office to work for Gascon, who was elected on an anti-police platform. Under Gascon, she \"impermissibly\" used the improperly obtained data to assist, according to the California Attorney General's Office.\n\nDuring a controversial tenure in the DA's office, she allegedly used some of that information to help criminal defendants and stifled line prosecutors under her.\n\nWho would have guessed that a DA who is so incredibly anti-police would hire someone who allegedly \"helped herself to confidential information\" to go after the police rather than the criminals?\n\nIf all that is true, which I would not be surprised if it was, then it's pretty obvious why Gascón personally trusted and hired her to be at the top of management, as all of this is truly how ethical his office seems to be.\n\n\"She illegitimately accessed the officers' files while with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department,\" Tatiana Chahoian, a deputy district attorney who told Fox News Digital in March that Gascon sent an armed plainclothes investigator to intimidate her at her home after an unrelated whistleblowing incident. \"Then she came to the district attorney's office and used all that information against the officers.\"\n\nIn one case that Chahoian prosecuted, she said a woman who took a felony plea deal after breaking another woman's clavicle in a road rage fight was involved in a separate use-of-force incident with the deputy while holding her baby.\n\nEveryone gets road rage but not everyone breaks clavicles because of it and it says all we need to know about Gascon's office, as they work to hide other cases she is involved with to decrease accountability. Because when alleged criminals start investigating alleged criminals, you get the rogue prosecutor movement.\n\nTeran allegedly withheld the entire case file as well as video evidence from the DA's office, including Chahoian, who was handling the proceedings. In bodycam video that Sheriff Robert Luna later released, a DUI suspect can be seen arguing with deputies who pulled her boyfriend over in a DUI stop and found the infant without a car seat or seat belt.\n\nThat is only one instance, there are at least 10 more incidents where these sorts of abhorrent things occurred.\n\n-- (@)\n\nIf convicted, she should go to jail. Withholding evidence as a public servant is about as corrupt as one can get, especially considering her job is meant to uphold public safety but she seems to not be concerned with any of them.\n\nThis story is further evidence that nothing good can possibly come out of the Progressive Prosecutor movement because there is nothing ethical about a Progressive Prosecutor, as all they care about is fueling lawlessness at the expense of public safety.\n\nQuestion: What is one to do when the prosecutors have allegedly turned into criminals themselves?\n\nWhen public officials truly believe that the entire justice system is evil and must be destroyed, it's not surprising that these are the sorts of things we get. Subsequently, across the country, our justice system has become unjust.",

The action-adventure game launches on iPad and iPhone on June 6, and users can pre-register now. However, not every iOS device will be able to run it.\n\nAssassin's Creed Mirage comes to iPhone and iPad on June 6\n\nAs Digital Trends reported, Assassin's Creed Mirage is a full console game, so not every iOS device can run it. Specifically, players will need an iPhone with an Apple A17 Pro chip or an iPad with an Apple A1 chip. This limits it to the iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, iPad Air, and iPad Pro. Ubisoft also recommends players use a controller for the best experience, though one is not required. The first 90 minutes are free to play after downloading it from the App Store, with the rest of the game costing $50.\n\nSet in 9th century Baghdad, Assassin's Creed Mirage follows protagonist Basim in his quest to prevent the Order of the Ancients from acquiring artifacts of great power. It's something of a back-to-basics for the series, with a smaller open world and no RPG mechanics. However, the game saw only mixed reviews, with some critics criticizing the shallow story, gameplay, and word design. The Xbox Series X/S version averaged 77 on Metacritic, with the PC and PS5 versions averaging 76.\n\nStill, the game is not without fans, and it's the first full AAA Assassin's Creed game on iOS. This puts it in a small club of recent AAA console games on iPhone. Other notable members include Resident Evil: Village, the RE4 Remake, and Death Stranding: Director's Cut.",

        "text": "The upcoming iPhone 16 series appears poised to shake up the conventional norms surrounding iPhone screen sizes, according to the latest leaks of iPhone 16 case dummies. Shared by Apple tipster Sonny Dickson and reported by PhoneArena, the images showcase all four speculated iPhone 16 models side-by-side, arranged by their perceived premium hierarchy.\n\nThe largest model, the iPhone 16 Pro Max, is supposedly set to have a 6.9-inch display, a slight increase from the last 6.7-inch screen. Similarly, the iPhone 16 Pro is also anticipated as per the rumors to see a bump in size, from 6.1 inches to 6.3 inches, while the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus are expected to maintain their sizes. Additionally, the dummies suggest a departure from the diagonal camera arrangement of the iPhone 15 series in favor of a vertical alignment for the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus.\n\nOne plausible reason for this design shift could be related to spatial video capabilities. While the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max can capture spatial video, the base models cannot due to limitations in camera configuration. By reintroducing the vertical camera layout akin to the iPhone 12 series, Apple could potentially enable spatial video recording for a wider user base, possibly to bolster sales of its Apple Vision Pro headset.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that dummy units, while indicative, may not always be entirely accurate. Nonetheless, these latest leaks align with previous ones, instilling a degree of confidence in the reported features and design changes of the iPhone 16 series.\n\nRegarding camera upgrades, the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max are expected to retain their existing camera arrangements, while benefiting from increased screen sizes. The larger screens are speculated to facilitate an ultrawide camera enhancement for the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max, along with an optical zoom range boost for the latter.\n\nDespite the excitement surrounding these leaks, it's advisable to approach them with caution until official confirmation from Apple. Nonetheless, the consistent patterns across multiple leaks provide a compelling glimpse into what consumers might expect from the iPhone 16 lineup.",

        "text": "Yarilet Perez is an experienced multimedia journalist and fact-checker with a Master of Science in Journalism. She has worked in multiple cities covering breaking news, politics, education, and more. Her expertise is in personal finance and investing, and real estate.\n\nA monopoly is a company that dominates its sector or industry, meaning that it controls the majority of the market share of its goods or services, has little to no competition, and its consumers have no real substitutes for the goods or services provided by the business.\n\nMonopolies came to colonial America well before the United States was born. In many ways, the large-scale public works that were required to build the New World were heavily reliant on large companies to carry them out.\n\nThese companies were granted exclusive contracts by the colonial governors. Even after the American Revolution, many colonial holdovers continued to function because of the contracts and land that they held.\n\nThis act banned trusts and monopolistic combinations that placed \"unreasonable\" restrictions on interstate and international trade. The act was a hammer that gave the federal government the power to shatter big companies into smaller pieces.\n\nDespite this act's passage, the next 50 years saw the formation of many domestic monopolies. At the same time, it was used to attack several monopolies, with varying levels of success. In many ways, the act sought to distinguish between \"good\" and \"bad\" monopolies.\n\nOne example of a \"good\" monopoly at the time was International Harvester, which produced cheap agricultural equipment for a largely agrarian nation and was thus considered untouchable. American Tobacco, on the other hand, was suspected of charging more than a fair price for cigarettes, which were at the time touted as a cure for everything from asthma to menstrual cramps. American Tobacco consequently became a victim of the government's wrath and was broken up in 1911.\n\nHow Did Standard Oil Become a Natural Monopoly?\n\nThe oil industry was prone to what is called a natural monopoly because of the rarity of the products that it produced. John D. Rockefeller, the founder and chair of Standard Oil, and his partners took advantage of both the rarity of oil and the revenue produced from it to set up a monopoly.\n\nThe business practices and questionable tactics that Rockefeller used to create Standard Oil would make the Enron crowd blush. But the finished product was not nearly as damaging to the economy or the environment as the industry was before Rockefeller monopolized it.\n\nIn the early days of the oil industry, many competing oil companies were eager to find a source and drilled indiscriminately, pumping waste products into rivers or straight out on the ground rather than troubling with proper disposal. They cut costs by using shoddy pipelines that were prone to leakage.\n\nBy the time Standard Oil had cornered 90% of oil production and distribution in the U.S., it had learned how to make money off even its industrial waste, with Vaseline being one of the new products that was developed.\n\nYet the benefits of having a monopoly like Standard Oil was only evident after it had built a nationwide infrastructure for oil distribution. Its sheer size and scale of resources allowed the company to avoid dependence on trains and their notoriously fluctuating costs.\n\nDespite the eventual breakup of Standard Oil in 1911, the government realized that a monopoly could build up a reliable infrastructure and deliver low-cost service to a broader base of consumers than competing firms. That lesson influenced its decision to allow the AT&T monopoly to continue until 1982.\n\nAs the history of Standard Oil shows, when a monopoly can deliver a quality product consistently at a reasonable price -- particularly when startup costs for competitors are astronomical -- the government may allow it to exist as long as it can regulate it to protect consumers.\n\nWhat Are the Limitations of a Monopoly?\n\nAndrew Carnegie had gone a long way towards creating a monopoly in the steel industry when J.P. Morgan bought his steel company and merged it into U.S. Steel to create a monstrous corporation approaching the size of Standard Oil.\n\nU.S. Steel controlled about 60% of steel production at the time, but competing firms were hungrier, more innovative, and more efficient. Eventually, U.S. Steel stagnated as smaller companies ate more and more of its market share.\n\nPart of the reason for its decline was that U.S. Steel was made up of many subgroups that did not seize on new technological innovations, such as continuous casting, which was far more cost-effective. In addition, it fought for protective tariffs against foreign steel, which allowed it to raise prices higher, which negatively impacted the customer. In this way, the U.S. Steel monopoly illustrates the limitations of monopolies due to a lack of competition in a given industry.\n\nHow Did U.S. Antitrust Regulations Evolve?\n\nFollowing the breakup of sugar, tobacco, oil, and meatpacking monopolies, big business didn't know where to turn. There were no clear guidelines about what constituted monopolistic business practices.\n\nThe founders and management of so-called \"bad\" monopolies were enraged by the hands-off approach taken with International Harvester. They argued that the Sherman Act didn't make any allowances for a specific business or product and that its execution should be universal rather than operate like a lightning bolt that struck select businesses.\n\nIn response, the Clayton Act was introduced in 1914. It set some specific examples of practices that would attract Sherman's hammer. Among these were interlocking directorships, tie-in sales, and certain mergers and acquisitions if they substantially lessened competition in a market.\n\nThe Clayton Act was followed by a succession of other acts demanding government review before any large mergers or acquisitions were finalized.\n\nThese innovations gave businesses a slightly clearer picture of what not to do but did little to curb the randomness of antitrust action. Major League Baseball even found itself under investigation in the 1920s, but escaped by claiming to be a sport rather than a business and thus not classified as interstate commerce.\n\nEnd of a Monopoly Era?\n\nThe last great American monopolies were created a century apart, and one lasted over a century. Others were very short-lived and some continue operating today, as highlighted chronologically below.\n\nAT&T\n\nAT&T Inc. (T), a government-supported monopoly, was also an essential public utility. Like Standard Oil, the AT&T monopoly made the industry more efficient. It wasn't guilty of fixing prices, but rather of the potential to fix prices.\n\nThe breakup of AT&T in the 1980s gave birth to the regional Baby Bells. Over time, many of the Baby Bells began to merge and increase in size to serve a wider area.\n\nThe breakup of AT&T may have caused a sharp reduction in service quality and even higher prices for many customers. But that is now long past, and the descendants of the Baby Bells are finding a natural balance in the market without calling down Sherman's hammer again.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nIn the 1990s, a case was brought against Microsoft centered on whether it was abusing its position as a so-called noncoercive monopoly. A noncoercive monopoly exists because brand loyalty and consumer apathy keep people from searching for an alternative.\n\nLike U.S. Steel, Microsoft couldn't dominate the market indefinitely across certain business segments because of innovative domestic and international competition. Ultimately, Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) never actually broke up even though it lost its antitrust case, which took place through the 1990s.\n\nThe Microsoft monopoly got a little chipped at the edges as rival operating systems gained ground and rival software, particularly open-source software, threatened the bundle business model that Microsoft was built upon. It also failed over time to dominate the internet browser wars. Because of this, the antitrust decision now seems irrelevant.\n\nMeta (Formerly Facebook)\n\nIn today's world, big tech companies are the new monopolistic powers, none so much as Meta Platforms (META), formerly Facebook. As of January 2024, Meta controls three of the five biggest social media platforms in the world -- Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.\n\nIn December 2020, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) sued the company, claiming that it was maintaining its social networking monopoly via anticompetitive conduct.\n\nAs part of the antitrust lawsuit, the FTC argues that Meta has done this through its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, as well as by imposing anticompetitive conditions on software developers. Furthermore, the company enjoys a significant amount of control over how personal data is shared and how advertising is allocated, raising concerns for regulators.\n\nThe FTC is calling for a breakup of Meta through the divestiture of WhatsApp and Instagram, which Meta has rejected, while stating that the case is too narrow and doesn't consider other key competitors such as Apple, Microsoft, and Google-parent, Alphabet.\n\nApple\n\nIn March 2024, the FTC accused tech giant, Apple, of monopolizing the smartphone market. The lawsuit claims that Apple uses exclusionary practices that make it challenging for competitors to integrate with its smartphones.\n\nAndroid users, for example, don't have access to the same iMessage features as iPhone users, and their messages are not encrypted. The Justice Department argues that this disincentivizes consumers from buying less expensive alternatives to Apple smartphones.\n\nToday, Apple controls over 65% of the U.S. smartphone market and is the second-largest company globally by market capitalization.\n\nThe crux of the matter is that Apple should enable rival software to work more effectively on Apple iPhones, instead of making them operate worse than the iPhone-to-iPhone interface. These restrictions, in turn, represent noncompetitive behavior and lock in consumers to buy Apple products.\n\nIn recent years, Apple has faced other antitrust issues for abusing its market power in its App store business practices -- namely, how it monopolizes its payment systems, where it takes a 27% cut from software developers across any purchase or subscription.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn the early 1900s, anyone suggesting that the government didn't need to have a hammer to smash big business would have been eyed suspiciously. But globalization and the maturity of the world economy have prompted calls for the retirement of antitrust laws.\n\nOver the years, these calls have come from people like economist Milton Friedman, former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, and everyday consumers.\n\nBut if the history of government and business is any indication, the government is more likely to increase the range and power of antitrust laws rather than relinquish such a useful weapon.",

        "text": "American monopolies date back to colonial administrators who awarded large companies exclusive contracts to help build the New World. From the late 19th to the early 20th century, these companies maintained singular control over the supply of their respective commodities. Without free-market competition, they could keep the prices of steel, oil, and tobacco high.\n\nWhat Are Examples of Early American Monopolies?\n\nMany of the most significant U.S. monopolies emerged during America's Gilded Age at a time of rapid industrial growth.\n\nOne of the leading monopolies was U.S. Steel, which had a market capitalization of $1.4 billion in 1901, equivalent to roughly $51.4 billion today. U.S. Steel was established through the merger of many major steel firms by financier J.P. Morgan. At the time, it was the world's largest company.\n\nStandard Oil, which controlled a 90% of American oil refineries in the late 1880s, is another notable juggernaut. During the oil boom, Standard Oil acquired several competitors, which allowed it to create a bottleneck in the petroleum industry supply chain. Along with this, the company negotiated favorable contracts with railroads, which further propelled its growth.\n\nYet another significant monopoly at the time was American Tobacco. In 1890, five major tobacco firms merged to create the monopoly, which allowed it to create economies of scale in a highly lucrative industry. Between 1890 and 1907, the company acquired an estimated 250 firms.\n\nAt the time, government regulation of early American monopolies was initially absent. However, the creation of antitrust regulation in the United States, in the form of the 1890 Sherman Antitrust Act, led to the eventual dismantling and restructuring of Standard Oil and American Tobacco by 1911. Like many antitrust cases brought against companies even today, it took several years for these first cases to navigate through the court system.\n\nUnlike Standard Oil and American Tobacco, U.S. Steel was challenged, but not found to be the sole supplier of steel to the U.S. market. However, it continued to possess a considerable market share for many years. In 2022, U.S. Steel was the 27th-largest producer of steel in the world, according to the World Steel Association.\n\nThe AT&T Monopoly and Antitrust Regulation\n\nA more recent monopoly to have experienced the same fate as Standard Oil and American Tobacco is the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T).\n\nSubject to many lawsuits spanning back to the 19th century, AT&T became entangled in one it no longer could escape. In 1974, the U.S. Department of Justice brought suit against the telecommunications giant, citing it had violated antitrust laws. Specifically, AT&T was accused of monopolizing the American telecommunications industry, preventing fair competition.\n\nIn 1982, AT&T finally settled with the government. It was required to divest 23 of its local telephone companies, 67% of its assets. The company split into seven regional companies, known as Baby Bells. In return, AT&T was allowed to enter the computer business.\n\nModern Day Monopolies\n\nA good example of a near-monopoly from very recent history is the De Beers Group, perhaps the best-known diamond mining, production, and retail company in the world. For almost a century, De Beers monopolized the diamond industry. However, market and regulatory factors diminished its market share from approximately 85% in the late 1980s to around 29% in 2022.\n\nAs part of the regulatory crackdown on the company, De Beers pleaded guilty to conspiring to fix industrial diamond prices and was ordered to pay $10 million in the 2004 U.S. Department of Justice vs. De Beers case.\n\nLike De Beers, Big Tech companies have faced scrutiny for having monopolies over their respective markets. Google, for instance, has faced antitrust lawsuits that allege that the company uses anticompetitive practices by giving an unfair advantage to its search platform. Similarly, Amazon has been accused of locking out its competitors through tactics that penalize sellers from setting lower prices on different sites.\n\nAs recently as 2024, Apple faces allegations of monopolizing the smartphone market in a landmark suit, with regulators claiming that the company engages in anti-competitive behavior.\n\nWhile several U.S. companies in sectors like technology, consumer products, and food and beverage manufacturing have been accused of being monopolies in the media and some in courts, it rarely has been proven.\n\nWhat Is the Role of Nationalization?\n\nMost monopolies that exist today do not necessarily dominate an entire global industry. Rather, they control major assets in one country or region. This process is called nationalization, which occurs most often in the energy, transportation, and banking sectors.\n\nThe largest such example of a nationalized major asset is Saudi Aramco, also known as the Saudi Arabian Oil Company. Headquartered in Dhahran, Aramco is Saudi Arabia's state-owned oil and natural gas company.\n\nFounded in 1933 by the Standard Oil Company of California, Aramco was taken over by the Saudi Arabian government in the 1970s. Today, most of the government's budget revenues come from Aramco's revenues.\n\nIn 2019, Aramco set a record with the world's largest IPO, raising more than $25 billion from 3 billion shares sold. Continuing its success, Aramco's market capitalization places it among the largest companies in the world, alongside giants such as Apple and Microsoft.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn many cases, monopolies have gained significant market power in sectors that have high barriers to entry and steep fixed-costs, such as steel, oil, and telecommunications industries.\n\nMonopolies often can help a country or region build or shore up its infrastructure quickly, efficiently, and effectively. But when any company becomes too dominant, leaving little room for competition, service, quality, and consumer wallets can suffer. Historically, antitrust regulation has played a key role in breaking up monopolies, although these instances have proven to be quite rare.",

        "text": "BOONE COUNTY, Ind. -- A stabbing incident involving three juveniles in Thorntown was sparked by a dispute over THC edibles, new court docs show.\n\nPolice records filed Tuesday indicate two juvenile suspects hit and possibly stabbed a juvenile victim on Sunday afternoon. The suspects were reported to be a 16-year-old boy and a 17-year-old boy.\n\nBoone County Sheriff's Deputies interviewed all three juveniles. The victim initially claimed he was on his way to hang out with some of his friends when the suspects first approached him.\n\nThe victim told police that he knew the suspects because they went to school together. He added that he tried not to associate with them because they were involved in activities like smoking THC vapes.\n\nThe victim said the suspects later began hitting him, and one of them eventually stabbed him in the back. Both the victim and his father believed the 16-year-old stabbed him because he was known to behave erratically, possess a knife collection and be a \"knife fanatic.\"\n\nAccording to court documents, the victim initially told police he thought the suspects were after his Apple AirPods when he was stabbed. During their interview with the suspects, police learned that the pair had gone after the victim because he had THC edibles.\n\nWhen deputies pressed the victim about the suspects' claims, he then clarified his story and told police he had edibles in his backpack. The juvenile claimed he was trying to get rid of the edibles and wanted to sell them to the suspects.\n\nCourt records indicate that the victim called some of his friends after he was stabbed, indicating he \"wanted to handle things on his own.\" His friends ultimately convinced him that he was in no condition to retaliate and needed to seek medical attention.\n\nThe victim's friends then helped him back to his house, where his father contacted emergency personnel.\n\nDuring their interviews with Boone County Sheriff's deputies, both suspects admitted to hitting the victim. Neither suspect, however, confessed to stabbing the victim.\n\nCourt documents show that BCSO's interview with the 17-year-old boy had to be stopped for a short time because he started acting strangely. When investigators asked the boy if he was OK, he said he was high.\n\nOne of the juveniles said that, after the incident unfolded, they went to one of their houses and ate the edibles they had stolen.\n\nPolice collected the victim's top -- a black shirt with a confederate flag and \"IT'S A SOUTHERN THANG\" printed on the front and \"Y'ALL WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND\" on the back.\n\nLaw enforcement reporting on the investigation indicates deputies did search the victim's backpack. One of the bag's front pockets was open and a portion of a knife handle with a pink paracord wrapped around it was visible. A red stain was present near where the knife was situated in the bag.\n\nCourt records indicate that the 16-year-old suspect showed deputies a message he received from another juvenile. The message sender wrote that he was going to kill the 17-year-old.\n\nAs of this article's publication, it is unknown exactly how the juvenile suspects will be charged. The offenses listed in police reports pertaining to the incident are battery resulting in serious bodily injury and robbery.",

        "text": "HONOR touts its MagicBook Pro 16 as a powerhouse, but it performs well in some areas and not so well in others -- yep, it's somewhere in the middle.\n\nQuick Links\n\nPricing and Availability Design and Build Keyboard and Trackpad Display and Audio Software, Performance, and Battery Life Verdict\n\nBefore diving into this review, I want to make one thing clear -- I've been using MacBooks for the better part of the last decade and have been using the MacBook Pro 13-inch (M1) since it debuted in 2020. So, when I got my hands on the HONOR MagicBook Pro 16, the big question on my mind was -- can this laptop replace my Mac? For any laptop to take on Apple's laptops, especially their new M-series MacBooks, it must excel in five areas: portability, build quality, display and audio quality, raw performance, and battery life.\n\nHONOR's new MagicBook Pro 16 comes ever so close to matching Apple's standards, but the machine makes one thing clear -- there's still a long way to go. With its 16-inch 165Hz screen, a powerful combination of Intel Core Ultra 7 CPU and RTX 4060 Laptop GPU, and some of the best speakers on a Windows laptop, the HONOR MagicBook Pro 16 offers a solid overall experience. However, there are some areas where it falls short. Keep reading for my detailed review to find out why and where it misses the mark.\n\nHONOR MagicBook Pro 16 Editor's Pick 8 / 10\n\nThe MagicBook Pro 16 is a sleek and powerful laptop by HONOR. It has plenty of horsepower, a big 16-inch display with a 165Hz refresh rate, a dedicated laptop GPU, and a whole load of AI features.\n\nOperating System Windows 11 CPU Intel Core Ultra 7 Processor 155H GPU NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 RAM 32GB Storage 1TB Battery 75Wh Display (Size, Resolution) 16-inch, 500 nits, 3072x1920 pixels, matte finish Speakers 6x Speakers and 2x Built-in Microphones Colors White Ports 2 x USB-C, 1 x HDMI, 1 x 3.5mm headphone jack Weight 1.86kg Connectivity Wi-Fi 5, Bluetooth 5.1 Security Fingerprint Power Button Pros Impressive build quality Excellent speakers and display for multimedia Snappy fingerprint scanner Plenty of RAM and storage Capable CPU Cons White body gets dirty quickly Gaming performance could've been better Bulky charger See at Honor\n\nPricing and Availability\n\nThe HONOR MagicBook Pro 16 was unveiled at the company's grand keynote at MWC 2024. However, in the typical HONOR fashion, the company hasn't announced the global pricing or availability just yet. In the home country China, the HONOR MagicBook Pro 16 starts at CNY 8,999 ($1,250 / €1,160) for the base model with Intel Core Ultra 5. We got our hands on the top-tier variant with the Intel Core Ultra 7, which is priced at CNY 9,999 ($1,400 / €1,290). We'll keep you posted on global availability as soon as we receive more info from the brand.\n\nDesign and Build\n\nSanuj Bhatia / Pocketnow\n\nStarting off with the design, which has been a standout feature of HONOR's products. Their Magic V2 was a \"groundbreaking\" foldable smartphone, and the Magic6 Pro brought its distinctive design to Android flagships. The MagicBook Pro 16 follows suit -- it carries on this tradition with its own flair.\n\nThe MagicBook Pro 16 comes with a pure white finish, with the outer shell given a rainbow hue. When I took out this machine out of the box, I was left amazed by this color. But, as expected, it gets dirty real fast. In fact, if you look closely, you'll see that my unit has already picked up a few permanent stains. If you're a cleaning freak, I would rather recommend you to get the outer surface laminated as soon as possible. Due to the white finish, I have been hesitant to eat near it, which is a shame given its speakers and display are exceptional for the price.\n\nBut, if you can overlook the color, it's a pretty solidly built laptop. You can get a fairly sleek design for a laptop with top-end, gaming-capable hardware. It weighs 1.86kg and measures 17.9mm in thickness -- only about 1mm thicker than the 16-inch MacBook Pro. The body features a soft brushed metal finish and is free from any overly flashy design elements. Even the outer shell features only the HONOR logo.\n\nSanuj Bhatia / Pocketnow\n\nThe placement of ports on the MagicBook Pro 16 is also thoughtfully done. There are six ports in total, with the most frequently used ones, like the 3.5mm headphone jack and two USB-C ports (one supporting PD charging), conveniently located on the left side. The right side has been left blank, while the back side of the laptop features the other ports, such as the HDMI port, two USB-A ports, and the proprietary charging port, making them less obtrusive.\n\nTo keep this thing cool, since this laptop can get a bit warm, HONOR has included air vents on all sides, including the back, bottom, and sides. However, the bottom line about the MagicBook Pro 16's build quality is that it's solid -- and this comes from someone who has been using Apple's MacBook for more than a decade. The hinge is also well-designed, opening smoothly with one hand, and with the body made mostly out of metal, the laptop feels sturdy and premium.\n\nKeyboard and Trackpad\n\nSanuj Bhatia / Pocketnow\n\nThe MagicBook Pro 16 features a full keyboard, complete with a numeric pad on the right side. This layout is great for those who value having a numeric pad, but as someone like me who's accustomed to centered keyboards, it took me a while to adapt. The fact that the keyboard has fairly small \"Enter\" and \"Shift\" buttons didn't help either.\n\nNonetheless, the overall responsiveness and feel of the keys are excellent. The keys are generously sized, offer good travel, and are relatively quiet. Once accustomed to this layout, you'll love typing on this machine. The keyboard even has backlighting. However, I found the lighting uneven and poorly visible against the white keys, and I switched off this feature on the first boot itself.\n\nSanuj Bhatia / Pocketnow\n\nThe keyboard is surrounded by the laptop's sound system on both sides. The top right key of the keyboard doubles as a power/wake button and the fingerprint scanner. The fingerprint scanner on this machine is probably the fastest I've used on a Windows laptop, unlocking the laptop almost instantly upon touch.\n\nMoving to the trackpad, the MagicBook Pro 16 offers a large trackpad with ample surface area, but this is another key area where this laptop falls short of other competitors. The trackpad feels plastic-y, and the click feedback is inconsistent, with the top half feeling stiff and the bottom overly flexible. HONOR definitely has room for improvement in this area.\n\nDisplay and Audio\n\nSanuj Bhatia / Pocketnow\n\nMoving onto the display, the MagicBook Pro comes with a large 16-inch \"FullView\" IPS LCD display with up to a 165Hz refresh rate and a resolution of 3072x1920 pixels. The display has a 16:10 aspect ratio, a matte finish, and can reach up to 500 nits of brightness. Even for someone like me who loves the glossy and colorful display of the Mac, the HONOR MagicBook Pro 16's display does a great job in maintaining excellent color reproduction and vibrancy, despite it being a matte display.\n\nThe high refresh rate makes sure Windows and overall UI look buttery smooth. And oh, did I mention the bezels? The bezels on three sides are virtually negligible and it makes for a great viewing experience when watching TV shows, movies, and sports. The screen is also TUV Rheinland certified for Low Blue Light and Flicker Free, similar to HONOR's other products. The only thing I would improve about this display is the brightness. The low 500 nits brightness means the colors take a hit when looked at from the side angles and in outdoor settings where the matte finish does not help either. Nonetheless, the overall experience is outstanding, especially considering the price.\n\nWhat complements this display beautifully is the laptop's sound system. The MagicBook Pro 16 may well have the best speakers of any Windows laptop currently on the market. For the first time in a while, I did not miss the sound system of my MacBook Pro -- which has become the industry standard at this point. The speakers deliver punchy, detailed sound across low, mid-range, and high frequencies, making for one of the best audio experiences I've had on a Windows laptop in a long time.\n\nSoftware, Performance, and Battery Life\n\nSanuj Bhatia / Pocketnow\n\nNow, moving onto performance, but let's first get the raw specs out of the way. The HONOR MagicBook Pro 16 is powered by Intel's Core Ultra 7 155H processor coupled with 32GB DDR5 RAM and 1TB SSD storage. For graphics, it includes a dedicated NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 laptop GPU with 8GB of memory and an Intel Arc built-in GPU, though it primarily relies on the RTX 4060 for graphic-intensive tasks. And, with HONOR calling this laptop an AI PC, thanks to the inclusion of two Gen3 compute engines NPU for handling AI-based tasks.\n\nAs you would expect from a laptop with this capable hardware, Windows runs fast and fluid on this device. From launching applications and booting up, to switching between browser tabs and editing documents or photos, the performance is stable and quick. The only improvement I'd suggest is streamlining Windows updates, but that's a task for Microsoft, not HONOR. But other than that, this thing flies right off the bat. Right from the moment you turn on this machine, you will feel it being buttery smooth and fast.\n\nHowever, the graphics performance does not meet the expectations for a gaming laptop. Despite setting it to performance mode and keeping it plugged in, the MagicBook Pro struggles to maintain a consistent 60fps in FIFA 23, with frame rates often dropping to between 40-43fps. I also tried to play Microsoft's Forza Horizon 5 on this machine, but found similar results with the machine failing to deliver smooth gameplay.\n\nHONOR has integrated several Apple-like cross-platform features. The MagicBook Pro comes equipped with HONOR PC Manager and HONOR WorkStation apps. PC Manager allows you to manage the laptop, including updating BIOS and drivers, backing up data, enabling spatial audio, and configuring HONOR Share.\n\nSanuj Bhatia / Pocketnow\n\nWorkStation, on the other hand, improves interoperability among HONOR devices, allowing for clipboard sharing, file transfers, screen sharing, and even using the laptop's input devices with your phone. You can also directly enable the phone's hotspot through the WorkStation app. While HONOR promises more AI features like document summarization, AI video subtitles, and more, these were not available at the time of review.\n\nRegarding battery life, the MagicBook Pro 16 falls short. The battery life is disappointing, with the laptop often running out before midday even under light use, which includes document writing and editing, web browsing, video streaming, and emailing. Additionally, the laptop comes with a bulky charger, which is cumbersome despite the option to charge via USB-C.\n\nVerdict\n\nSo, is the HONOR MagicBook Pro 16 worth it? In fairness to HONOR, it's a commendable attempt at creating a portable powerhouse. The MagicBook Pro 16 is equipped with some of the best hardware available, boasts excellent build quality, a display + sound combo that's unmatched on any Windows laptop, and delivers great performance, all for around $1000. While there are some shortcomings that make this laptop inferior against some of the competitors, these drawbacks are generally manageable for most users (even the most power users).",

        "text": "The author of the Silo novels is claiming that Season 2 of the Apple TV series is one of the best he's ever seen.\n\nSilo became a breakout hit for Apple TV+ last year - a sci-fi mystery in a dystopian setting, carried by a wonderful ensemble cast led by Rebbecca Ferguson. Given the reveals of Silo's Season 1 finale and its cliffhanger ending, fans have been waiting anxiously for Season 2 to arrive.\n\nThe 2023 Hollywood Writers' and Actors' Strikes of 2023 completely disrupted the filming of Silo Season 2, creating a very uncertain timeline for when production could be completed. Thankfully, Rebecca Ferguson recently gave fans a much-needed glimmer of hope when she revealed that Silo Season 2 had completed filming, once the strikes had ended.\n\nNow, the author of the Silo novel series (titled the \"Wool\" series) Hugh Howey, has posted a pretty titillating tease for fans of the show: \"I've seen season two and it's one of the best things I've ever seen.\"\n\nPost by @hughhowey View on Threads\n\nThat's a pretty serious endorsement; Silo Season 1 was, as stated, one of the most acclaimed and popular new TV shows to come out in 2023, so saying Season 2 is even better is a big claim, especially since sophomore seasons of TV can often stumble. Hearing the author of a book say the TV adaptation is something great is equally unique and worth noting. Then again, it's not like anyone who watches Silo Season 1 needs any endorsement or incentive to return for Season 2: the world of Howey's novels is, literally, only starting to open up.\n\n(SPOILERS) The Silo Season 1 Finale ended with Rebecca Ferguson's character Juliette Nichols, successfully venturing out of the Silo fallout shelter/community into the supposed poisonous wasteland, only to find a desolate landscape of ruined cities and many other creators, each with their own Silo. The implication being that these Silo \"communities\" are built inside former nuclear missile silos.\n\nHow Many Seasons of Silo Would There Be?\n\nHugh Howey wrote three Wool novels, which showrunner Graham Yost and co. have adapted into four seasons of the Silo TV show. The finite length of the show is something that Rebbeca Ferguson hasn't been shy about discussing:\n\n\"I believe that the show has an ending, and I know when that is,\" Ferguson said. \"So, that's the answer. You will find out when the show is done. To be honest, I don't think it's a secret. The books are the books. It's three books, and the three books are divided into four seasons. So, I believe, unless any Apple person is gonna jump on, I think we're absolutely fine with saying Season 1, we've done. Season 2 is shot and coming out, and we're now looking at green-lighting Seasons 3 and 4. And I think we would film them maybe together, and that would be the end.\"\n\nSilo Season 2 doesn't have a release date yet. Season 1 is streaming on Apple TV+.",

        "text": "DEE-ANN DURBIN Associated Press\n\nCHICAGO -- McDonald's plans to step up deals and value messaging to combat slowing sales.\n\nThe Chicago burger giant said inflation-weary customers are eating out less often in many big markets. In the first quarter, fast food traffic was flat or down in the U.S., Australia, Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom and Germany.\n\n\"The consumer is certainly being very discriminating in how they spend their dollar,\" McDonald's President and CEO Chris Kempczinski said Tuesday during a conference call with investors. \"It may be more pronounced with lower-income consumers, but its important to recognize that all income cohorts are seeking value.\"\n\nMcDonald's said its same-store sales -- or sales at stores open at least a year -- rose 1.9% worldwide in the January-March period. That was below Wall Street's forecast of a 2.1% increase, according to analysts polled by FactSet.\n\nPeople are also reading...

With grocery prices lower, many consumers are eating more meals at home. Still, the same-store sales increases the company posted in the first quarter were lower than the 3% to 4% McDonald's usually sees in a typical year.\n\nIn the U.S., same-store sales rose 2.5% in the first quarter, but that was largely due to price hikes carried over from last year.\n\nKempczinski checked his McDonald's app during the call and noted that there were multiple deals available in his area, including one Big Mac for 29 cents when you buy another. And Kempczinski said 90% of U.S. restaurants are offering meal bundles for $4 or less.\n\nBut Kempczinski said McDonald's needs a nationwide value message and marketing to back it up. In some areas, it's losing out to competitors on customers' perception of value and affordability, he said. Wendy's is currently offering free fries with the purchase of a medium burger, for example.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"There's a lot of great value out there, but everyone else has a value message too,\" Kempczinski said.\n\nThings aren't looking much brighter overseas. In McDonald's international franchised markets, same-store sales fell 0.2% in the first quarter as customers in the Middle East and Muslim-majority markets like Indonesia and Malaysia boycotted McDonald's for its perceived support of Israel. It was the first time since 2020 that quarterly same-store sales have fallen in that segment.\n\nThe boycotts began in October, after McDonald's Israeli franchisee announced it was providing free meals for Israeli troops involved in the war in Gaza. McDonald's has tried to limit the fallout. In early April, the company said it was buying Alyonal Limited, its Israeli franchisee, and taking over the country's 225 restaurants. Financial terms of the deal weren't released.\n\nKempczinski said the impact of the boycotts doesn't seem to be worsening, and some of those markets are still seeing delivery demand. But McDonald's expects the boycotts to continue for the forseeable future.\n\n\"We're not expecting to see any meaningful improvement in the impact on that until the war is over,\" he said.\n\nMcDonald's said its revenue rose 5% to $6.17 billion in the January-March period. That was in line with Wall Street's estimates.\n\nNet income was up 7% to $1.93 billion. Earnings, adjusted for restructuring charges, were $2.70 per share. That was short of analysts' forecast of $2.72.\n\nMcDonald's shares were flat in morning trading Tuesday.\n\nPhotos: Illinois State Fair political days through the years 2012 State Fair 2012 State Fair 2015 State Fair 2015 State Fair 2015 State Fair 2007 State Fair 2008 State Fair 2008 State Fair 2009 State Fair 2012 State Fair 2012 State Fair 2005 State Fair 2004 State Fair 2003 State Fair 2003 State Fair 2006 State Fair 2007 State Fair 2012 State Fair 2018 State Fair 2012 State Fair 2021 State Fair 2021 State Fair Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Trade The Economy Restaurant Industry Finance Gastronomy Armed Forces Business Stock Exchange The business news you need\n\nGet the latest local business news delivered FREE to your inbox weekly.\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.",
