The agenda for his visit includes discussions on artificial intelligence (AI) with government officials and developers.\n\nWhat Happened: Nadella's visit to Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia will focus on Microsoft's AI-related plans in the region, reported The Wall Street Journal on Thursday.\n\nThe trip is scheduled to take place after a recent visit by Apple Inc CEO Tim Cook, who expressed interest in investing in manufacturing in Indonesia.\n\nMicrosoft has a long-standing relationship with Southeast Asia, a region experiencing a surge in demand for data centers and advanced technologies to drive online commerce, digital transactions, and disruptive tech startups.\n\nThe company's Azure cloud-computing unit, which competes with Amazon, Google, and Alibaba in the region, opened its first Southeast Asia data center in Singapore in 2010.\n\nAnalysts anticipate substantial regional demand for AI-powered technology, which has already contributed to Microsoft's bottom line through its partnership with OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT. Microsoft has invested around $13 billion in OpenAI to secure a 49% stake in the startup's for-profit arm, positioning itself as a major player in the AI race.\n\nSee Also: Elon Musk Reacts As ARK Invest Analyst Says 'It's Going To Be Very Hard' For Tesla Rivals 'To Catch Up To Them' In Pricing: 'Accurate'\n\nAzure drives Microsoft's AI strategy and a series of AI software assistants called Copilot, powered by the same technology behind ChatGPT.\n\nThe company's enthusiasm for AI has continued to drive demand for its software and cloud services, with the Azure business growing 31% from a year earlier in the January-March quarter.\n\nWhy It Matters: Nadella's visit to Southeast Asia comes on the heels of a strong demand for Azure, particularly in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). During the third-quarter earnings call, Nadella highlighted Azure as a go-to platform for AI projects, which has significantly contributed to acquiring new customers.\n\nMicrosoft's third-quarter revenue increased 17% year-over-year to $61.9 billion, which beat the consensus estimate of $60.804 billion, according to Benzinga Pro. The tech giant reported quarterly earnings of $2.94 per share, which beat analyst estimates of $2.82 per share. Microsoft has now beat analyst estimates on both the top and bottom lines in five consecutive quarters, according to earnings data from Benzinga Pro.\n\nOn the same day, Nadella announced the company's record-breaking gaming performance and its expansion to Nintendo Switch and Sony PlayStation. The CEO also highlighted the successful addition of Diablo 4, the first Activision Blizzard title to the Game Pass service. Subscribers played over 10 million hours within the first 10 days, making it one of Microsoft's biggest first-party Game Pass launches ever.\n\nRead Next: Tesla Q1 Earnings Highlights: EV Giant Misses Wall Street Estimates, Makes Cost Cuts, Invests In AI, Speeds Launch Of New Models\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella.

        "text": "With recent multi-billion-dollar grants to Intel, TSMC, Samsung, and Micron, the US government has now spent over half its $39bn in Chips Act incentives. In so doing it has driven an unexpected investment boom. Chip companies and supply chain partners have announced investments totalling $327bn over the next 10 years, according to Semiconductor Industry Association calculations. US statistics show a stunning 15-fold increase in construction of manufacturing facilities for computing and electronics devices. Debate about the Chips Act has focused on delays and manufacturing difficulties, but the vast volume of investment tells a different story.\n\nPandemic-era shortages showed how small deficits of even lower-tech foundational chips could cause hundreds of billions of dollars of economic damage. The ensuing Chips Act aims to encourage construction of new chip fabrication facilities (fabs) in the US. This will reduce reliance on a small number of East Asian suppliers -- today nearly all cutting-edge processors are made in Taiwan.\n\nThe investment surge this has driven is reducing these vulnerabilities. Samsung, TSMC, and Intel -- the world's leading chipmakers -- are now building major new plants in the US. Intel will manufacture its most advanced chips there, while TSMC will introduce its cutting-edge 2-nanometre process in Arizona around two years after bringing it online in Taiwan. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo notes that by 2030, the US will probably produce around 20 per cent of the world's most advanced chips, up from zero today.\n\nThis still won't mean complete self-sufficiency, given that the US consumes over a quarter of the world's chips. Production of smartphones and consumer electronics would be disrupted in the event of a crisis in east Asia, an ever looming fear. But this production would be roughly enough for the needs of critical infrastructure like datacentres and telecoms. Chips aren't perfectly fungible, of course, and not every plant can easily produce every type, but the US will have much more scope to manage shocks.\n\nAs the pandemic-era shortages showed, it isn't only advanced chips that are economically critical. Manufacturers of autos, missiles or medical devices require large volumes of foundational chips as well. Here, too, the Chips Act is providing significant new supply. Ford and GM have announced major long-term supply deals with US chipmaker GlobalFoundries, which is expanding production with $1.5bn in Chips Act funds. Microchip, a widely used Arizona manufacturer of microcontroller chips, also received a grant to expand. Texas Instruments is building a string of new foundational chip fabs across Texas and Utah, catalysed by generous investment tax credits. Few if any of these investments would have happened without the Chips Act.\n\nProduction in allied countries is helping, too. Japan and Europe are investing in foundational chip capacity. Microchip and Analog Devices, another US chipmaker, have both announced plans to shift some production from TSMC in Taiwan to the company's new plant in Japan, providing increased resilience against China risks.\n\nCritics worry all these incentives create a subsidy race -- but this began well before the Chips Act. A 2019 OECD study found that between 2014 and 2018 at least two US companies received more money from a foreign government than from the US. That's partly why chipmaking migrated to high-subsidy locations. Now the Chips Act and similar incentives in Japan and Europe are attracting investment back.\n\nWill all these promised plants get built? Many of them already are. The scale of fab construction in the US is now stretching contractors' ability to find workers with speciality skills. TSMC plans high-volume chip production in its first Arizona plant early next year. If the chip market softens, some plants could get postponed, but the disbursement of grants is tied to progress in bringing fabs online.\n\nThere's still a risk that taxpayers are buying excess capacity if these new facilities can't find customers. However, many tech executives like OpenAI's Sam Altman are more worried about AI chip shortages than a glut. TSMC notes that its Arizona plant will work with Apple, Nvidia, Qualcomm, and AMD -- four of its largest customers. Intel recently announced a deal to manufacture AI processors for Microsoft.\n\nEquity investors will debate whether these new investments can deliver an adequate financial return. Policymakers who see the Chips Act as an insurance policy against geopolitical shocks believe it is already paying dividends.",

The results for the first three months of the year indicate that Google has bounced back after an unprecedented downturn in 2022 due to the pandemic.\n\nAlphabet also revealed plans to start paying shareholders a quarterly dividend for the first time since Google went public two decades ago. This move follows in the footsteps of tech powerhouses Microsoft and Apple, who have been paying dividends for years. Alphabet's quarterly dividend of 20 cents per share will be paid on June 17.\n\nInvesting.com analyst Thomas Monteiro hailed the decision to pay a dividend as \"a breath of fresh air for the tech market\". He suggested it could make investors more likely to back the increased spending Google will likely need for developing AI products, which could take years to yield returns.\n\nDuring the January-March period, Alphabet's revenue climbed 15% from the same time last year to $80.54billion, surpassing analysts' projections surveyed by FactSet Research. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter of accelerating year-on-year revenue growth for the Mountain View, California-based company.\n\nAlphabet earned $23.66billion, or $1.89 per share, a 57% increase from last year's comparable quarter. The earnings per share also eclipsed the analyst estimates that steer investors. \"We are incredibly well set up, given the innovation path we are on,\" Alphabet chief executive Sundar Pichai said in a conference call with analysts.\n\nGoogle's stock price surged by nearly 13% in after-hours trading following the news. The reaction contrasted sharply with investors' response to Meta Platforms' first-quarter earnings report, released earlier this week. Meta Platforms, Facebook's parent company, also reported a jump in ad revenue but offered a disappointing outlook for the April-June period, citing increased spending on AI technology as a factor that would squeeze profits.\n\nShould Alphabet's shares follow a similar trajectory during Friday's regular trading session, the stock will mark a new all-time high, pushing the company's market value above $2trillion. Digital advertising, primarily driven by Google's dominant search engine, continues to be the company's main revenue source. Google's ad revenue reached $61.66billion in the first quarter, a 13% increase from the same period last year.\n\nHowever, Google faces two major threats that could hinder its future growth. The US Department of Justice is targeting Google's search engine in a lawsuit, alleging that the tech giant has abused its power by striking lucrative deals with Apple and other firms to gain an unfair advantage over potential competitors, thereby stifling innovation and competition.\n\nFollowing a two-month trial last autumn, the closing arguments in the most significant US antitrust case in a quarter-century are set to take place next week. A federal judge is anticipated to decide by the end of this year whether Google has been violating the law.\n\nAs artificial intelligence technology developed by Google, Microsoft, and other industry heavyweights becomes more advanced, people may not need to depend as heavily on Google's search information to answer their queries and find other data. If AI gradually takes over the role that Google's search engine has played for the past 25 years, Alphabet's ad sales could also decrease.\n\nCurrently, AI is contributing to rapid growth in Google's cloud computing division, which saw its first-quarter revenue increase by 28% from last year to $9.57billion. However, the cloud division has also become a flashpoint for Google management, as dozens of employees have protested against a $1.2billion contract with the Israeli government that includes AI technology as part of Project Nimbus.\n\nThe employees protesting believe that Project Nimbus is being used lethally by the Israeli military in the Gaza war, a claim Google has refuted. The contentious issue reached a climax earlier this month during an employee sit-in at Google offices in Sunnyvale, California, and New York, resulting in over 50 workers losing their jobs.\n\nAlphabet concluded March with nearly 181,000 employees, a drop of almost 10,000 workers from the previous year. Management has gone through several rounds of mass redundancies to help increase profits while Google escalates its expenditure on AI technology.",

After the games were completed, lunch was served as a silent auction that helped the women hit the $30,000 mark.\n\nThe fundraising effort was also supported by three local sponsors - Fleur de Lis, Freeman Screen Printers and Embroidery and HOPE at the Lake Foundation.\n\nBosom Buddies said HOPE at the Lake Foundation's $5,000 sponsorship will directly support a local charity called the Marilyn Arena Foundation which benefits women and their families battling Stage 4 Breast Cancer or Metastatic Breast Cancer. The foundation identifies patients who are struggling financially due to the costs associated with metastatic breast cancer treatments and provide financial support through reimbursement of medical expenses.\n\nPeople are also reading...

I had posted on my group's social media page that I was getting ready to resume public speaking engagements, and another volunteer had asked about this. I replied I would look into doing so.\n\nI did look into it the day before I was due to speak. While it seemed fairly easy, I've worked with enough software to know nothing is as simple as it's made to appear. I set things up according to the YouTube video instructions and posted on my account that I would, hopefully, be livestreaming the event.\n\nThe good news was that almost everything about my presentation went well. The bad news was that the livestream, to the best of my knowledge, was seen by exactly no one. Next time I will recruit a twelve-year-old to help with this, but I was pleased this was the only whoopsie that occurred. It was the first time in years that I had done a public presentation.\n\nPeople are also reading...

In three trips to different national parks I've done everything from tracking elephants to capturing wild dogs. I've incorporated this work into my presentations as well.\n\nBefore the pandemic I did events regularly, sometimes staffing a display table and other times speaking about my volunteer work. I've accumulated quite a library of visual media from my endeavors and I find my audiences are usually captivated by pictures and video of elephants and other African wildlife.\n\nI had never been a public speaker, but I put a program together and ventured out to libraries, senior citizen centers, and schools. After the first few gigs my nervousness subsided and I even learned to speak extemporaneously when the audiovisual equipment failed at a couple engagements. I came to enjoy this tremendously important work. I had a full-time job but managed to hold an event at least once monthly, until the pandemic happened.\n\nI went without public speaking for three years. I did some outdoor tabling events but that was all that was possible, and over time I lost motivation for the work entailed with presentations. Once public life resumed I was hesitant to schedule a talk, but finally set up a date with the Audubon Library to speak at its newly expanded facility.\n\nIt was then that I hit the panic button -- my former presentation was no longer current, as several changes had taken place at the sanctuary, and my video materials were scattered over three computers, my phone, and several flash drives. Fortunately, I had retired from full-time work, and spent several days putting together a new presentation.\n\nFriends, family and strangers attended the presentation. The AV worked, my talk went over very well, and once again I garnered attention for my beloved elephants. I even was approached about speaking to a couple other groups, so I'm happy to say I'm back in the game.\n\nMaybe next time I'll even figure out how to livestream things.\n\n0 Comments Tags Public Speaking Volunteering Wildlife Conservation Elephants Eleambassadors Pandemic Audubon Library Av Technical Glitches Live Streaming My View Lori Duvall-jackson Job Market Ecology Armed Forces Entertainment Computer Science Internet Software Information Technology Media And Communication Catch the latest in Opinion\n\nGet opinion pieces, letters and editorials sent directly to your inbox weekly!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.",

Wallace, whose 143rd Assembly District includes Maryvale, said the final state budget provides the school district with a $1.7 million increase in need-based foundation aid. D'Angelo says the cost of educating the asylum-seekers has reached $800,000, or twice as much as the district had spent by October.\n\nThe state funding \"far exceeds any costs incurred by the district to educate the students seeking asylum,\" Wallace wrote in a news release shared on X.\n\nD'Angelo has shared his frustrations publicly - amplified in an interview with WGRZ, published in the Daily Mail and sent in a news release to local media - and directed them at New York City for its reimbursement delay. As a result of New York City's transport of about 600 asylum-seekers to Western New York late last summer due to a lack of housing, the superintendent believes New York City should bear the financial burden.\n\nPeople are also reading...

D'Angelo said no financial help has come from New York City, which Wallace now acknowledges. The legislator said she previously believed New York City had already sent 50% of the original $400,000 estimate.\n\nThe superintendent said he hopes to receive 100% reimbursement from New York City, which he said was promised initially, and not through other avenues. He said the state aid Wallace referred to is intended to fund \"operating expenses,\" not asylees. A spokesperson from the state Education Department said foundation aid can indeed be used for operating expenses, but Maryvale received extra funding because of its significant increase in English language learners.\n\nSchool aid not as bad as some school districts feared. But trouble lurks\n\nThe governor attempted to do away with save harmless, which guarantees a district would not receive less foundation aid than the previous year, but that was a non-starter for state legislators.\n\nThe asylees come predominantly from families fleeing danger in Latin American countries. They are housed temporarily in Cheektowaga and Amherst while they apply for asylum in the United States.\n\n\"We love the asylum-seekers as individuals, as students,\" D'Angelo said. \"They've enriched us.\"\n\nThe conflict, however, touches several larger themes: How politically divisive issues can seep into education, how New York State compensates school districts with unexpected swaths of high-need students, and complexities over the cost to educate new Americans.\n\nThe politics\n\nWallace interprets D'Angelo's public messaging about asylum-seekers as politically motivated. Criticism of Erie County's acceptance of asylum-seekers from New York City became a Republican rallying cry in November's race for Erie County executive, and U.S. immigration policies remain a hot-button issue.\n\n\"The more attention the school superintendent brings to it, the more it's becoming a political issue than it is providing resources for the children of Maryvale,\" Wallace said Wednesday. The legislator said she still is confident that Maryvale will be \"made whole,\" but Erie County Republicans quickly latched onto the school's message.\n\nA non-MAGA Republican and an anti-MAGA Democrat face off in race for Congress\n\nIn a heavily Democratic district, in a race that could further narrow the GOP's majority in the House, West Seneca town supervisor Gary Dickson comes across as a traditional, pre-MAGA Republican. And his opponent, State Sen. Tim Kennedy, comes across as a traditional Democrat.\n\nThe sidewalk outside Maryvale High School on Wednesday served as a Republican campaign stop. Gary Dickson, the Republican candidate running against Sen. Tim Kennedy, a Democrat, in the special election April 30 for the 26th Congressional District seat vacated by Brian Higgins, raised concerns about Maryvale's lack of compensation.\n\nDickson was flanked by Pat Chludzinski, who's running for Wallace's Assembly seat; Jack Moretti, a contender for the 63rd Senate District seat; and Michael Kracker, chair of the Erie County Republican Party.\n\n\"Are we left to hope that New York City Democrats have WNY's best interests at heart? No? So who is standing up for what we need?\" Dickson asked in a Facebook post summarizing the news conference.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nHow much should Maryvale receive?\n\nThe cost of educating 76 asylees in Maryvale has risen throughout the school year, D'Angelo said.\n\nIn October, the superintendent said the district had spent $412,000 on costs related to the asylum-seekers. Now, that total is nearly $800,000, he said, with the bulk of the costs related to staffing.\n\nWhich schools get how much state money - and why?\n\nWho gets how much money from New York State and why is a hot topic of conversation these days among school districts. It's also a bit of a\n\n\"When they first came in, we didn't know the level of services that they would need,\" D'Angelo said. \"Our teachers needed time to conduct assessments to determine the level of service\" for English language learners. \"So that assessment necessitated the hiring of staffing.\"\n\nD'Angelo said Maryvale has hired six aides specializing in teaching English as a new language, 1.6 ENL teachers with another position close to being filled and an elementary ENL coordinator.\n\nBoth Wallace and D'Angelo believe Maryvale should be compensated for educating the asylum-seekers, but the legislator said she would like more specifics on how Maryvale's costs have doubled. The legislator cited Sweet Home Schools, which has spent about $100,000 extra to educate 60 asylee students who arrived from New York City when Maryvale received its influx.\n\n\"How come Sweet Home can educate these students at a fraction of the cost?\" she asked.\n\nEnglish language learners are not new to either school. Maryvale has educated between 160 and 200 English language learners every school year since 2018, while Sweet Home has enrolled between 160 and 220 ELLs each year over the same period, according to state Education Department data.\n\nSweet Home Superintendent Michael Ginestre said his school district was well-equipped to handle late arrivals from New York City. The biggest cost has been transportation, he said. The district did not have to hire any additional teachers or aides.\n\n\"We reallocated some of our resources to help educate our new students,\" Ginestre said. \"We speak 42 different languages here at Sweet Home, so we have a network set up for all of our English language learners.\"\n\nSupport from State Education Department\n\nA key to the dispute is whether an increase in foundation aid from the state budget is an appropriate reimbursement for Maryvale and Sweet Home's education of asylum-seekers. D'Angelo is adamant the answer is \"no.\"\n\n\"Again, any Foundation Aid Maryvale receives is used to cover operational expenses, not the political decisions made by New York City,\" he said to punctuate his news release.\n\nJP O'Hare, director of communications for the state Education Department, explained how new Americans factor into these districts' foundation aid, which typically accounts for roughly two-thirds of a district's total state aid.\n\n\"As with any student, the cost of educating newly arrived immigrant students depends on the specific needs of individual students and the services that most appropriately address those identified needs. The foundation aid formula contains factors weighted for student needs. Every additional student generates state aid, but for newly arrived students who are English language learners, eligible for free- or reduced-price meals, or have a disability, the formula will generate additional funds. Enrollment in the 2023-24 school year impacts 2024-25 foundation aid, so increases in projected 2024-25 foundation aid in the enacted budget does reflect increased needs in these districts.\"\n\nIn other words, both Maryvale and Sweet Home - by educating the asylees - will receive more state funding for higher enrollment as well as for educating more high-need students. The use of foundation aid is generally unrestricted and is typically used to cover operating expenses, as both D'Angelo and Ginestre said, but the amount allotted is dictated in part by the level of need of district students. The benefits of this budget will not come until next school year, though.\n\nO'Hare said the state Education Department has helped the districts with more immediate sources of funding. He said those sources include Title III -- Part A: ELL grant money, which can be allocated for the English language instruction of low-income students.

Representatives from the state Education Department, Erie 1 BOCES, Erie County, New York City and DocGo, the health service contracted by New York City to care for asylum-seekers, have been in discussions with the districts.\n\nThe Governor's Office, which operates separately from the state Education Department, is also working on funding.\n\n\"The state continues to work closely with the federal government, State Education Department, New York City and other localities to provide the needed support and ensure school districts receive the necessary funding as they welcome younger asylum seekers into their schools,\" a spokesperson for Gov. Kathy Hochul said Wednesday.\n\nPromises will not satisfy D'Angelo until funds have been received.\n\n\"Maryvale has not yet seen any of the funds that New York City has promised as reimbursement,\" D'Angelo said, \"although it is still fighting to be made whole.\"\n\n0 Comments Tags Hospitality Facilities Social Services Politics School Systems The Economy Job Market Education Institutions Finance Trade Public Administration Business Journalism Banking Linguistics Law Government Departments And Ministries Welfare Armed Forces Transportation Get local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSubscribe to our Daily Headlines newsletter.\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.

        "text": "OpenAI, a tiny company in comparison to biggies like Meta Platforms, Alphabet, Amazon, and Apple had stolen a march on others when it rolled out its artificial intelligence-enabled ChatGPT chatbot. That it had a working relationship with tech giant Microsoft, did not detract from any of its massive achievements. Since then, everyone has been scrambling to jump on the AI bandwagon in an attempt to take the lead. Which means, what next for OpenAI to stay ahead of the pack? GPT-5 is the likely answer.\n\nGPT-5 is likely to offer significantly more features to users than previous versions did. CEO Sam Altman has already indicated the company is working on it, but has not indicated any timeline that it may be following. Its capabilities, he revealed would be \"significantly better\" than anything that has come out from its labs so far. Till recently, social media speculations had it that the company would pick Altman's birthday on April 22 to do the honours, but that has passed.\n\nNow, as to exactly what this enhanced performance and capabilities may consist of is unclear, but there is room to think ahead from what is available now, including with rivals. GPT-5, which has been undergoing training since late 2023 is likely to feature significantly more parameters or a stronger architecture, Tom's Guide reported.\n\nGPT-5 model is widely speculated to be multimodal and that may indicate it will not be limited to text-based inputs and will span images and more on the lines of what Google's Gemini models offer. It may well include voice, video functionalities too, and most importantly, Internet access by default, rather than limiting it to a previous date.\n\nNotably, the new capabilities of GPT-5 may transform the chatbot into an \"agent\" or an assistant - a smart one. In effect, it would be able to actually do tasks autonomously for the user - perhaps, carry out real-world actions. For instance, order products from shops, book airline tickets or even take calls on users' behalf.\n\nWhen is all this expected to happen? While ChatGPT is now expected to be rolled out in the summer, all these \"agent\" functionalities may not be there. There will be some, but most others will likely not be rolled out this year, Tom's Guide reports.\n\nWhen asked the question about the launch timeline on the Lix Fridman podcast, Sam Altman had said, \"I don't know. That's the honest answer.\" He followed that up with, \"We will release an amazing new model this year.\" So, at the moment, it is unclear what the launch will consist of - an upgrade to the current GPT model, or something bigger like a GPT-4.5 or even GPT-5 itself.\n\nIn summary, the buzz surrounding OpenAI's potential announcement suggests that GPT-5 could mark a significant advancement in AI capabilities, with improvements in multimodality, agent functionalities, and internet access. While specific details remain elusive, the trajectory indicates a shift towards more versatile and capable AI models, paving the way for enhanced interactions and applications across various domains.",

        "text": "At the end of March, Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi unveiled its first electric vehicle (EV), the SU7, igniting a spark of excitement. At the launch event, Xiaomi's founder and CEO Lei Jun, whose vision includes creating \"a dream car on a par with Porsche and Tesla,\" said that it was a product of pushing boundaries.\n\nThe market's positive response was immediate: the Xiaomi SU7 garnered almost 90,000 substantial orders within just 24 hours of its release; Xiaomi's stock jumped by 16 percent on its first trading day post-launch.\n\nBusiness Insider remarked, \"Apple abandoned its electric vehicle project. Now, one of its biggest rivals in China is showing how it's done.\"\n\nXiaomi's debut in the EV sector is expected to incentivize a new round of market competition. Price cuts across various brands after Xiaomi's launch, from the Huawei Aito M7 to the 2024 Xpeng G9, demonstrate the dynamic nature of China's EV market.\n\nBut the impact extends beyond China. Better and more affordable Chinese EVs are a boon for overseas consumers too. China's EV exports have seen a significant rise in recent years, with data showing a 77.6 percent increase to 1.2 million vehicles in 2023.\n\nOne of the reasons electric vehicles produced in China are popular worldwide is that they come in a wide variety of models with different prices, offering more choices for consumers. Moreover, they are equipped with rich software and hardware features, allowing consumers to fully experience the convenience and comfort that smart cars provide.\n\nDespite the initial success, Chinese EVs are facing considerable challenges abroad. Creating products that better cater to the preferences of overseas consumers can count as one. But, a bigger problem comes from protectionist policies imposed by the West, with an \"overcapacity\" rhetoric aiming to suppress Chinese industries.\n\nHowever, the fierce competition in China's new energy vehicle market, including price wars and fast quality upgrades, is not caused by the so-called \"overcapacity.\" In addition, the problems facing the EV industries in the United States and Europe stem from inefficiencies in corporate operations, not from Chinese \"overcapacity.\"\n\nChina's new energy products are competitive because they started early and have kept investing in its R&D, hence a leading edge in technology. Combined with the country's vast range of supporting industries, mega-size markets, and rich human resources, that leading edge becomes integrated competitiveness.\n\nIn a report earlier in April, Bloomberg found that no data is backing China's alleged \"overcapacity\" in the EV sector, saying that Chinese companies are more efficient rather than loaded with excess capacity. It added that Chinese companies aren't dumping EVs on global markets and Chinese EVs are not cheap overseas.\n\nFor instance, BYD's EV sedan Han is around 70,000 euros in the Netherlands, while the Tesla Model 3 long-range edition is sold at less than 60,000 euros.\n\nChina's green industry meets many countries' need to address the energy shortage and respond to climate change, and will contribute to the global green and low carbon transition.\n\nTake the European Union as an example. According to the European Green Deal, all new cars and vans registered in the EU will be zero-emission by 2035, de-facto banning cars and vans with internal combustion engines except e-fuel ones from registering and providing huge space for EV development in the bloc. By adopting these sustainably designed EVs, including those made in China, Europe can move faster toward a decarbonized economy.\n\nThe expansion of Chinese car manufacturers into global markets underscores a broader narrative of China's rise as a technological and industrial powerhouse. And, China's latest accomplishments in the EV sector are not a threat. The application of new EV technologies, ranging from battery efficiency to intelligent driving solutions, offers valuable insights and inspiration for European manufacturers.\n\nIncreased competition from China would help European carmakers produce better cars in the long run, said Ola Kaellenius, chairman of the board of management of Mercedes-Benz Group, in a recent interview with the Financial Times, adding that protectionism was \"going the wrong way.\" Chinese companies looking to export to Europe represent a \"natural progression of competition and need to be met with better products, better technology, more agility,\" he added.\n\nOver the last two decades, China's automotive sector has shifted from hosting foreign automakers' joint ventures to being pioneers in the EV domain. This evolution, as demonstrated by initiatives like Xiaomi's, is not merely about business expansion, but also a bold statement of China's commitment to sustainable development and its companies' dedication to delivering better products to consumers.",

        "text": "Apple software beta tester, \"Helps make our computers and phones work!\" - Zach's grandparents\n\nApple is expected to release iOS 17.5 to the general public in the coming weeks, but don't forget to check out all the new features the tech giant included in iOS 17.4. That update was released almost two months ago on March 5 and it brought major changes for people in the European Union, new emoji and important bug fixes to your iPhone. Apple later released iOS 17.4.1 on March 21, which patched a couple of zero-day vulnerabilities on your iPhone but didn't include any new features.\n\nApple introduced a significant change to Safari, the App Store and iOS with iOS 17.4, but only for people in Europe. With iOS 17.4, people in the EU can download an alternative app store and apps from outside the App Store. As CNET's Katie Collins reports, this marks one of the largest changes to the App Store since its inception in 2008. People in the EU will also be given new default app controls, giving them more ways to customize their iPhone experience.\n\nApple made these changes, announced in January, to comply with the EU's Digital Markets Act.\n\nRead more: Apple Will Allow Installation of Rival App Stores On iPhones In Europe\n\nApple introduced more ways to make in-app payments with iOS 17.4. If you go to Settings > Privacy & Security, you'll see an option called Contactless & NFC, or near-field communication. If you tap the new option, you'll be taken to a mostly blank page that has a small disclaimer that says the page will show apps that have requested the ability to use contactless and NFC payments in the future. Apple announced these options alongside the changes for people in the EU, and there's no word on whether this will be used by apps outside that region.\n\nApple introduced over 100 new emoji to iPhone users with iOS 17.4. Those emoji include heads shaking up and down or left and right, a phoenix and a slice of lime. These emoji were announced in 2023, and some Android devices, including the latest Samsung phones, already have them.\n\nWith iOS 17.4, your iMessage chats get a security boost to protect them from cyberattacks that involve quantum computing. According to CNET's David Lumb, Apple said it hasn't seen these kinds of cyberattacks yet, but the company wants to get ahead of the potential threat now.\n\nRead more: Apple's Next iOS Update Protects iMessage Against Future Quantum Computing Attacks\n\nIn iOS 17.4, you can read the transcripts of your favorite podcasts as you listen to them. To see the transcripts, go into the Podcasts app and start listening to a show, then tap the media player across the bottom of your screen. There's a new button in the bottom left corner of your screen that looks like a speech bubble with quotes inside it. Tap this button and you'll see the transcript of the show you're listening to.\n\nYou can search within the transcript, too, so if someone mentions a book or movie title and you only remember part of it, you can search the part you do know and find the whole title.\n\nRead more: What to Know About Podcast Transcripts on iOS 17.4\n\nYour Apple Cash gets an upgrade with iOS 17.4, too. Now you can view virtual card numbers for your Apple Cash which lets you shop at online stores that don't accept Apple Pay. This card comes with its own number, expiration date and three-digit security code, like a physical card. You can also easily request a new card number if you think your card has been compromised.\n\nRead more: How to View Your Apple Cash's Virtual Card Numbers\n\nIn iOS 17.4, Apple introduced a new digital clock app widget called City Digital. This widget displays the time as well as a set location as opposed to wherever your iPhone is at the moment. This can be helpful if you're traveling or live far from family and friends but want to keep in touch without waking them up in the middle of the night.\n\nApple introduced the digital clock widget to iPhones with the release of iOS 17.2.\n\nApple introduced a few new options in Stolen Device Protection with iOS 17.4. The new options let you choose whether you want to always require a 1-hour security delay to access certain settings or make changes, or to only require the delay when you're away from a familiar location like your home.\n\nApple introduced Stolen Device Protection with iOS 17.3 with the intent to protect some of your data if your device is stolen or falls into nefarious hands. The feature doesn't protect all your data, but Apple still recommends everyone turn it on.\n\nRead more: How to Give Your iPhone's Stolen Device Protection a Boost\n\nWith iOS 17.4, iPhone 15 models get a new Battery Health readout. If you go to Settings > Battery, you'll see a new option that tells you the status of your battery's health in a word, like Normal or Service. You can also tap this option for more details about your battery, like its cycle count and maximum capacity. Before, your iPhone would show a percentage correlating to your battery's health without any indication of what it means.\n\nRead more: iOS 17.4's New Tool Shows if Your iPhone 15's Battery Health Is Normal\n\nApple introduced a Home button in Apple Music and the Books app with iOS 17.4. If you open either app and look at the bottom of your screen, the Home button is in the far-left corner. This button replaced Listen Now in Apple Music and Read Now in Books.\n\nIf you're an Apple Music subscriber and tap the button, you're taken to a page that shows you menus, like Recently Played, and recommendations based on artists you've listened to. If you tap this button in the Books app, you see menus like Current Bestsellers and Start Reading for Free.\n\nPrevious iOS updates brought Home buttons to the Podcasts and Apple TV apps, so this change is likely Apple trying to apply some uniformity across its apps.\n\nIn iOS 17.4, Apple gave Siri the ability to read messages in multiple languages. Once enabled, Siri can read messages in languages like Spanish, dialects of Mandarin and Thai. Apple writes that this won't change the primary language Siri listens and responds in.\n\nRead more: How to Enable Siri to Read Messages in More Languages\n\nWith iOS 17.4, if you use Apple CarPlay with Maps in certain supported vehicles, you'll see a new instrument cluster.\n\n\"With supported CarPlay vehicles, Apple Maps will present a new instrument cluster experience with information about upcoming maneuvers,\" Apple wrote online. \"Users will be able to swap the desired display type between the main and instrument cluster screen by tapping the map configuration button on the upper right of the Maps main screen.\"\n\nApple didn't say which vehicles support this new feature, and the company didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nHere are the full release notes for iOS 17.4.\n\nEmoji\n\nNew mushroom, phoenix, lime, broken chain, and shaking heads emoji are now available in the emoji keyboard.\n\n18 people and body emoji add the option to face them in either direction.\n\nApple Podcasts\n\nTranscripts let you follow an episode with text that highlights in sync with the audio in English, Spanish, French and German.\n\nEpisode text can be read in full, searched for a word or phrase, tapped to play from a specific point and used with accessibility features such as Text Size, Increase Contrast and VoiceOver.\n\nThis update includes the following enhancements and bug fixes:\n\nMusic recognition lets you add songs you have identified to your Apple Music Playlists and Library, as well as Apple Music Classic.\n\nSiri has a new option to announce messages you receive in any supported language.\n\nStolen Device Protection supports the option for increased security in all locations.\n\nBattery Health in Settings shows battery cycle count, manufacture date, and first use on iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro models.\n\nCall Identification displays Apple-verified business name, logo and department name when available.\n\nBusiness updates in Messages for Business provide trusted information for order status, flight notifications, fraud alerts or other transactions you opt into.\n\nApple Cash virtual card numbers enable you to pay with Apple Cash at merchants that don't yet accept Apple Pay by typing in your number from Wallet or using Safari AutoFill.\n\nFixes an issue where contact pictures are blank in Find My.\n\nFixes an issue for Dual SIM users where the phone number changes from primary to secondary and is visible to a group they have messaged.\n\nSome features may not be available for all regions or on all Apple devices.

The Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra and the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max are two smartphones that stick out from the many other top smartphones in the world. These cellphones are full with incredible features and attributes. We have chosen the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra that comes with 200 MP quad camera whereas iPhone 15 pro comes with triple camera ( 48MP +12MP +12MP) in order to initially match the price of these two smartphones due to the high cost of the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, which is more than Rs. 1.2 lakhs. Let's look at the specifications of the two smartphones to help you make the difference between them.\n\nThis Apple model, which includes an Apple A17 Pro processor and 128 GB of internal memory, has 8 GB of RAM. iOS v17 is used by the Apple iPhone 15 Pro. This model features a 12 MP front camera with retina and a 48 MP + 12 MP + 12 MP triple rear camera with LED flash. Nonetheless, the Qualcomm 8 Gen 2 CPU powers the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra. This phone has 512 GB of internal capacity in addition to 12 GB of RAM. This gadget runs Android 13, which is its operating system.

        "text": "BEIJING (AP) -- China's vision of the future of the automobile -- electrified and digitally connected -- is on display at the ongoing Beijing auto show.\n\nOrganizers say that 117 new models are making their debut at Auto China 2024, which runs through May 4. They range from eye-poppingly cutting edge to more subtle novelties.\n\nTHE CONNECTED CAR\n\nOne of the biggest mob scenes was for the opening day presentation by Xiaomi, a major Chinese maker of smartphones and trendy, affordable smart appliances aimed at younger generations that's entering the car market for the first time.\n\nXiaomi announced that it had received more than 75,000 orders in the four weeks since the launch of its first car, the SU7, with a list price of 215,900 to 299,900 yuan ($29,800-$41,400).\n\nWhy is a phone company making a car? Analysts say connectivity. Consumer technology companies want to connect the lives of their customers across all their devices -- phones, laptops, televisions and now cars.\n\n\"It starts with the concept of the third place,\" said Beatrix Keim, the China director at German auto research center CAR. \"Because nowadays people are at the office, at home and then mainly they're spending the time in the car.\"\n\nThe approach works well in China, a highly digital society where e-payments are the norm and the convenience of connectivity trumps privacy concerns for most.\n\nChinese telecom giant Huawei has ventured into the car business too. Apple explored the idea but dropped it earlier this year.\n\nTHE CAR AS LIVING SPACE\n\nSome Chinese makers are taking the idea of a third space to new heights.\n\nZeekr unveiled the Mix, an electric vehicle with an interior that can transform into a small room while parked. The front seats swivel to face the back ones, with a table in between that a company executive told the crowd could be used to play card games or enjoy a Chinese hot-pot meal.\n\nStefan Sielaff, the design director of Zeekr, described the Mix as \"a nice experiment\" focusing on younger families.\n\n\"I wouldn't even call it a car or an MPV or a van,\" he said. \"It's more a lifestyle capsule. It's an iPod on wheels.\"\n\nIt will be the fifth model for Zeekr, a 2 1/2-year-old premium EV brand of China's Geely group, a major maker that owns Volvo and has designers in Sweden and Shanghai.\n\nThe Mix will go on sale in China by the end of June, the company said. Its selling price has not been announced.\n\nTHE HYBRID APPROACH\n\nAn EV boom in China that started three years ago has eaten into the market for gasoline-powered cars, but they are not dead yet.\n\nSo says Chery Automobile Co., China's biggest exporter, which told its auto show audience that it would continue to develop gasoline cars as well as EVs and hybrids.\n\nIts EXEED Yaoguang C-DM, a hybrid SUV launched last month, was one of four vehicles it highlighted -- two hybrids and two EVs.\n\nThe Yaoguang SUV sells for 159,800 to 225,800 yuan ($22,000-$31,000) in China and is also aimed at overseas markets, a company news release said.\n\nHybrids, which have lagged EVs in China, are now seen as a growth opportunity. Last year, 2.6 million new hybrids were sold in China, about half the number of EVs. Together, they accounted for 36% of the market.\n\nTHE LUXURY TANK\n\nChinese EV maker BYD, known for its low-cost battery technology and cars, is also going after the high-end market in China, defined as 1 million yuan ($140,000) and up.\n\nIts Yangwang brand introduced the latest version of the U8, a monster of an off-road SUV that was launched last September and is designed for survival in rugged conditions. It comes with a satellite phone in case a driver gets stuck beyond cell phone range.\n\nThe U8 is built on a platform that enables it to turn on the spot, like a tank. It's priced at 1.1 million yuan ($150,000). For 100,000 yuan ($13,800) more, buyers can add a built-in drone system.\n\nA SIMPLER APPROACH\n\nVolvo, the Swedish brand now under Geely, offered an answer for those overwhelmed by technology.\n\n\"The current EV market is marked by a prevalent trend of excess and addition,\" said Roger Yu, Volvo's managing director for sales in greater China.\n\nHe introduced the EX30 electric SUV as a user-friendly vehicle with a sophisticated sound system and a tablet screen that are both easy to use.\n\n\"By subtracting for ease of use and adding for safety, Volvo aims to give users the clearest interface, the most user-friendly operation, and the most reassuring intelligent experience,\" he said of the in-car screen.\n\nThe company announced that the EX30 would sell in China for 210,000 to 260,000 yuan ($29,000-$36,000).\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press researcher Yu Bing and video producer Olivia Zhang contributed.",

        "text": "According to recent reports, Google plans to enable the Bluetooth \"Auracast\" function in the upcoming Android 15 system. This feature will allow users to broadcast content to multiple Bluetooth-connected devices simultaneously, revolutionizing the way we share audio. Auracast, a new Bluetooth technology, enables one-to-many audio broadcasting. It allows users to stream audio to a group of Bluetooth devices, such as headphones, earbuds, or hearing aids. This feature has already been introduced by Samsung, which has added support for Auracast to its Galaxy Buds 2 Pro, smart TVs, and various other devices running One UI 6.1 or higher.\n\nDedicated Auracast Page in Android 15\n\nIn the Android 15 Developer Preview 2 update, Google has introduced an \"audio sharing\" page, which will serve as the dedicated hub for Auracast functionality. While the feature was not fully functional in the initial release, the recent Android 15 Beta 1.1 update has enabled it on Pixel 8 Pro phones.\n\nOn the \"Audio Sharing\" page, users will be able to control and manage their Auracast settings. They can choose a broadcast name and password under the \"stream settings\" heading, allowing them to customize their audio-sharing experience.\n\nAlso, users can tap on a QR icon to generate a QR code that others can scan to connect to their devices and receive the shared audio.

The iPhone has millions of users who would never consider switching to another brand. And although there are things to improve, or we would like it to have a lower price, year after year, the iPhone sweeps sales and also in the satisfaction index.\n\nFor Apple, It is very important to measure this index and thus be able to modify their next generations of iPhone, such as the iPhone 16, based on the comments and level of satisfaction of iPhone 15 users.\n\nWe begin to see the Satisfaction rates in the United States for the iPhone 15 and also the iPhone 15 Pro. The Perfectrec medium conducts a monthly survey of iPhone users, and in fact, we have very recent data about the satisfaction of the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro until February of 2024.\n\nIt is curious how, in this survey, the model with the highest satisfaction rate is the iPhone 15 Plus, while the lowest is the iPhone 15 Pro. The reasons? This year, the iPhone 15 range and iPhone 15 Plus has received very interesting improvements such as the Dynamic Island or a 48 megapixel sensor.\n\nOn the other hand, the iPhone 15 Pro It does not have the x5 zoom of the iPhone 15 Pro Max yeThe rest of the cameras are identical to its predecessor, the iPhone 14 Pro. So, yes, it is the least valued model in this table for more than obvious reasons.\n\nAlthough the United States is the country where iPhone use predominates, there is a place in the world where the satisfaction rate is extremely higher to the one mentioned above. And it is that in Mexico, Apple can be very proud.\n\nThe satisfaction index in Mexico rises to 96.4% according to the latest study by The CIU. This percentage is well above its main competitors such as Samsung, Xiaomi or Oppo. The most appreciated aspect for the Mexicans it is iPhone camera and the quality of the device materials.\n\nThese data are worth analyzing, since while Apple is facing difficulties in China or stagnates with its satisfaction rate in the United Statesthere are countries and people who perceive much more value.\n\nThis may be directly related to the device renewal rate. That is, if in Mexico the average smartphone renewal is three years and in the United States it is a year and a half, Apple users in Mexico will perceive many more improvements compared to American users.\n\nHow would you categorize your level of satisfaction with the iPhone? You can leave it to us in comments. I have an iPhone 15 Pro Max and it is the iPhone model that has left me most satisfied after the iPhone 13 Pro. So I I would give you 90% satisfaction. I appreciate the titanium material and the telephoto camera. To improve would be the maximum brightness of its screen and the ultra-wide-angle camera.",

It will also offer users more control over these new status reactions, allowing them to manage their communication according to their own preferences,\" mentions the report.\n\nRead on to find out more.\n\nYour phone's always buzzing because everyone and their neighbour reacted to your WhatsApp status?\n\nNot anymore, hopefully.\n\nWhatsApp is introducing a new feature that will allow you to manage notifications for reactions to your status updates.\n\nFor the uninitiated, WhatsApp statuses, like Instagram stories, are temporary updates that disappear after 24 hours.\n\nYou could react in likeness to each status update you see but with this upcoming feature, spotted in the latest version of WhatsApp Beta for Android (v2.24.9.29), you'll have the option to disable notifications for these reactions.\n\nNot sure if it will be available for iOS or not.\n\nHowever, saving the best for last, WhatsApp is reportedly working on an offline file-sharing feature that could revolutionize the way we exchange data.\n\nDubbed \"People nearby,\" this feature will allow you to share any content between two phones instantly and securely, thanks to end-to-end encryption.\n\nWhile the exact details of how this feat will be achieved are still under wraps, we can assume that WhatsApp might leverage Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology, similar to Google's Fast Pair-based Quick Share feature for Android phones or Apple's AirDrop for iPhones.\n\nImagine being able to share countless photos or videos without worrying about cellular data bills or slow internet connections.\n\nThis feature could be a game-changer, especially in areas with limited or unreliable internet access.\n\nAgain, not exactly sure when or if iOS users are going to get this update.\n\nUsually, what follows on Android generally makes its way to iPhone users as well, so keep your fingers crossed.\n\nWhile the feature was initially spotted in the Android beta version, it's highly likely that WhatsApp will roll it out to iOS users as well, ensuring a consistent experience across platforms.\n\nAlthough the specifics are still unknown, it's expected that WhatsApp will use Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to facilitate the seamless transfer of files between devices.\n\nUsers will need to grant WhatsApp access to their photos, media, and files, and the recipient will need to have the \"People nearby\" feature enabled to receive the content.\n\nAs of now, there is no confirmed information regarding the maximum file size that can be shared using this feature. However, given WhatsApp's focus on seamless data transfer, it's reasonable to expect that large files will be accommodated.\n\nSince the feature is still in development, it's difficult to say whether it will be available for both Android and iOS devices from the outset.\n\nHowever, given WhatsApp's cross-platform nature, it's likely that the feature will eventually be rolled out to all supported devices.\n\nAlso Read: WhatsApp Replaces SMS Two-Factor with Passkey Authentication for Android Users",

Image: Karen Dias/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nSince 2017, when Apple first started assembling its older version of iPhones in India, there have been many significant developments. The majority of the progress happened last year, following Apple CEO Tim Cook's India visit in April 2023. Apple's efforts to branch out its supply chain from China are finally bearing fruit in India. Through its contract manufacturers Foxconn, Pegatron, and Tata-owned Wistron, iPhone exports from the country have multiplied. Exports have reportedly surged from $6.27 billion in the fiscal year 2022-23 to $12.1 billion in 2023-24.\n\nApple's market share too has improved after the company's decision to move its assembly lines here. Apple's market share in India currently stands at 6.4 percent, up from 4.6 percent in 2022. The company is looking at 8 percent share this year. However, to capture more share and offer the handset at a reasonable price, the Cupertino-based company will have to go beyond just assembling the iPhones here.",

The leak also highlights some other key components of the new computer-dedicated chipset.\n\nWeibo tipster @FixedFocus predicted that the Huawei Kirin PC SoC (system on the chip) could adopt the latest Taishan V130 architecture for better performance.\n\nFurther details reveal that the chipset's multi-core performance is close enough to Apple's M3 processor. Note that M3 launched in late 2023 (October 30) and is the first 3nm chip from the American firm, designed for flagship laptops and desktops.\n\nIf true, the Kirin PC chipset will add a new performance efficiency to all upcoming Huawei notebooks. Although the latest input is still revolving in speculations and the company is yet to confirm these segments for its computer-based processor.\n\nAnother interesting detail is, Huawei could make improvements to the design and overall architecture of the chip and might follow the strategy of the Pro/Max version for Kirin PC, just like the Apple M3. Thus we may find more new variants on board.\n\nThe tipster also mentioned that the Huawei Kirin PC will use a Mali-920 GPU paired with 32GB RAM and 2TB of storage. The GPU's performance is equivalent to the M2 chip. Overall highlights of the chip are as follows:\n\nHow far these components will fit with the real specifications might be clear by September this year. Till then, we only look forward to innovative Huawei products.\n\nThis year's Kirin products are likely to be more powerful and proficient than their predecessors.

        "text": "Ever since a door plug flew off an Alaska Airlines flight midair in January, the world has awaited an answer to the Big Question:\n\nYes, when the Boeing 737 MAX 9's fuselage ripped open, a smartphone flew out and tumbled down 16,000 feet. The iPhone 14 Pro Max was found completely unharmed. Yet your phone's screen turned into a spiderweb when you accidentally nudged it off your bathroom counter.\n\nWas it because a protective case cocooned the airborne phone? Was it because it was a newer, more durable unit? Was it rescued and repaired by a family of bears?\n\nEvery year, Apple, Samsung and other smartphone makers tell us about their improved durability -- Ceramic Shield! Gorilla Armor! And still the first thing we do with a shiny new phone is shove it in a case. Do we still need to? Perhaps we should all go...naked?\n\nThere was only one way to find out: Make it rain phones.\n\nMy producer and I created the Phone-Droppin' Drone (trademark pending) and set out to drop iPhone 14 and Samsung Galaxy S23 devices from 3, 30 and 300 feet onto grass and asphalt.\n\nIt was thrilling. And the results taught us as much about physics as they did about phone durability. Let's break it down.\n\nI'd watched enough \"MythBusters\" to know I needed some key components to run these tests:\n\n* Phones: I bought iPhone 14 and Galaxy S23 models from refurbished-device company Back in the Box, which confirmed the original hardware was intact. No screens or batteries had been replaced. While not the latest models, these phones use top-of-the-line Corning glass and represent the latest durability claims made by Apple and Samsung.\n\n* Space: A 300-foot drop required landing zones of grass and asphalt -- and no innocent passersby! Thankfully, New Jersey's beautiful Sussex County Fairgrounds fit the bill.\n\n* Drone: My smartphone-testing desire has no limits, so, yes, I considered dropping the phones while skydiving. But a drone gave us more control for hitting specific heights and targets. My producer-turned-MacGyver, David Hall, rigged a contraption to release phones with the press of a button on the drone controller.\n\n* Carnage: You aren't tuning in to this to see phones survive and look pretty. You want shattered glass, you'll get shattered glass. These phones didn't give in so easily, though.\n\nThe naked iPhone and Galaxy handled the grass well, surviving both the 3-foot and 30-foot drops. I wasn't surprised.\n\nIt was the 300-foot drop that took my breath away. From so high up, the phones looked like tiny birds swooping down from the sky. Yet despite loud thumps when hitting the ground, they sustained no real damage -- only grass stains and dirt lodged in the charging ports.\n\nNow, I can hear you saying, in the words of Creed, \"Can you take me higher?!\" Except there was no need to do that.\n\n\"It doesn't matter if you drop the phone from 300 feet up or from space,\" said Mark Rober, a former NASA mechanical engineer turned YouTuber. \"It's going to be the same result because of something called terminal velocity.\"\n\nRober would know. He famously dropped an egg from 100,000 feet above the earth. (It survived.)\n\nSo, terminal velocity? It's the speed an object hits when the gravitational force equals the air resistance force.\n\nOK, OK, I wasn't paying attention in high-school physics either. I called Rhett Allain, an associate professor of physics at Southeastern Louisiana University. He explained that, because of the mass, size and shape of a smartphone, it will increase in speed until it hits about 60 miles an hour. At that point, air resistance keeps it from getting any faster.\n\nHe assured me that 300 feet in the air was enough height for all of these devices, with and without cases, to reach their terminal velocities.\n\nThere's another physics concept to take into account: deceleration, commonly called \"smashing into something.\" Rober and Allain explained that grass cushions the falling object, allowing for slower deceleration. Harder surfaces like asphalt -- or your bathroom tiles -- cause a much more abrupt deceleration.\n\nSo I repeated all those tests on asphalt -- and set all the phones to record video of their falls, of course:\n\n* The 3-foot drop: The naked iPhone and Galaxy S23 survived two drops each on the asphalt, sustaining only small nicks and dents.\n\n* The 30-foot drop: The naked iPhone slammed the asphalt hard, shattering the glass on the back. Everything else was fine. In fact, it was still recording video.\n\nOn the Samsung, the top left and bottom right of the OLED screen shattered and the screen now flickers.\n\nWhen I reattempted the 30-foot drop with durable OtterBox Defender cases on fresh iPhone 14 and Galaxy S23 models, both survived. The cases caught some damage but were still usable.\n\n* The 300-foot drop: Given the 30-foot results, I only attempted the high-up asphalt test with OtterBox Defender cases. And, oh, the sounds of them hitting the pavement! The iPhone's entire back glass cracked, including all the glass around the camera. But the iPhone itself still works! And should be repairable.\n\nThe Galaxy S23 landed so hard on the bottom right corner that the rubber case tore. The screen didn't crack, but the entire phone bent and no longer powered on.\n\nSean Bates, who discovered the fallen Alaska Airlines case-covered iPhone while on a walk in Portland, Ore., told me he found it under a bush on the grass-covered shoulder of the road. A few feet over and it could have been roadkill. The owner of that fallen phone, Cuong Tran, said he's still using it.\n\nMy physics experts told me not only does a good case provide cushion during the rapid deceleration of a phone drop, it also protects the more vulnerable contact areas.\n\n\"If you hit your phone on the corner of the phone, it's going to have a very small contact area and more likely to break,\" Allain said. \"If you hit it on the flat surface, the contact area would be larger.\"\n\nDoug Kempel, vice president of engineering at OtterBox, told me the team designed Defender cases with various plastic and rubber pieces to absorb shock before it reaches the phone.\n\nOtterBox tests its Defender Series cases by dropping them 26 times from 4 feet. Each of those 26 drops are engineered to hit on different parts of the phone -- corners, edges, etc. That sequence is repeated five times with each case.\n\nSo yes, cases can be useful when you're worried about that glass screen and back. Corning, the company that makes the durable glass in the iPhone and Galaxy, declined to talk to me.\n\nJust remember -- case or no case -- if you happen to drop your phone out of an airplane, make sure it lands on grass. It's probably not a bad idea to install a grass floor in your bathroom, too.",

The new technology significantly enhances chip logic density and performance, promising substantial improvements for high-performance computing (HPC) products and data centers.\n\nHistorically, Apple has been among the first companies to adopt new chip fabrication technologies. This past year, it was the first company to utilize TSMC's 3-nanometer node with the A17 Pro chip found in the iPhone 15 Pro and the iPhone 15 Pro Max. Apple's most advanced chip designs have historically appeared in the iPhone before making their way to the iPad and Mac lineups and ultimately trickling down to the Apple Watch and Apple TV.\n\nTSMC is noted as planning to introduce the A16 production process in 2026. The process incorporates innovative nanosheet transistors along with a novel backside power rail solution. This development is expected to provide an 8-10 percent increase in speed and a 15-20 percent reduction in power consumption at the same speeds compared to TSMC's N2P process, alongside up to a 1.10x chip density improvement.\n\nTSMC also announced the rollout of its System-on-Wafer (SoW) technology, which uses multiple dies on a single after to boost computing power while occupying less space. This, in turn, could be transformative for Apple's data center operations. TSMC's first SoW offering, which is already in production, is based on Integrated Fan-Out (InFO) technology. A more advanced chip-on-wafer version leveraging CoWoS technology is slated for readiness in 2027.\n\nTSMC is also said to be making progress towards 2-nanometer and 1.4-nanometer chips that could be used in future Apple products. Its 2nm \"N2\" node is scheduled for trial production in the second half of 2024 and mass production in late 2025, to be followed by an enhanced \"N2P\" process in late 2026. Trial production of the 2nm node will begin in the second half of 2024, with small-scale production ramping up in the second quarter of 2025. In 2027, facilities in Taiwan will start to shift toward production of \"A14\" 1.4nm chips.\n\nIt's thought that TSMC's A18 chips will be used in Apple's iPhone 16 lineup, and be based on N3E, while the \"A19\" chips slated for the 2025 iPhone models could use Apple's first 2-nanometer chip. Come 2026, Apple will likely move to an enhanced version of this 2nm node, followed by the newly announced 1.6nm process.\n\nStay tuned for additional details as they become available.",

As a producer of elasticated outre pop his output is as varied as it is frenetic, taking in everything from bass-rattling electronic workouts for cultural behemoths such as Beyoncé to celestial dreamscapes for underground newcomers, via collaborations with Caroline Polachek and longterm partner in crime, Charli XCX. Having initially steered clear of solo albums to focus on running his divisive yet hugely influential label PC Music, Cook's debut, 2020's 7G, featured 49 tracks and more than two hours of music ranging from face-melting dance experiments to a lo-fi Sia cover. Apple, a more streamlined, but no less polarising followup arrived a month later.\n\nHis hard drive somehow still not yet full, Cook is now back with his third album Britpop, a three-part, 24-song opus split into Past, Present and Future sections. As part of its promotion he's been busy creating TikToks and launching his own parody website Witchfork, billed as \"the least trusted voice in music\". \"It's obviously embracing some troll behaviour, which has always been a bit of a thread for me personally,\" he laughs.\n\nIf this all sounds like a lot of work, it makes more sense when you meet its creator. Across our hour-long video call Cook barely stops talking, with tangents taking in everything from Brexit to S Club 7's 00s TV shows (\"I'm very familiar with their version of media and reality,\" he says with genuine enthusiasm). A simple question like, \"Where are you now?\" (short version: he's in LA, but frequently returns to his home town of London) quickly unspools into a lengthy answer about his position in the pop cosmos.\n\n\"I work with people who are involved in pop music at a high level and they see me as a weirdo who's ready to inject some strange thing,\" he says, his kinetic energy making his shoulder-length hair bob about excitedly. \"Then I work with my friends who are doing club nights and they see me as the mainstream guy who has experience working with bigger artists. So for someone on that fault line, LA is a really interesting place. I can dip into different things and push my own perspective.\"\n\nThat position in the pop cosmos was assured by PC Music. Launched in 2013, the label covered the pop landscape - then dominated by beige stars such as Ed Sheeran and Emeli Sandé - in metallic neon. Cook oversaw, and often co-produced, the output of fellow oddballs such as Danny L Harle, GFOTY and Hannah Diamond, creating a synthetic, saccharine sound that was combined with stylised visual presentation to match. Unironically referencing so-called \"guilty pleasures\" of the past (90s German happy hardcore outfit Scooter, for example) while giving a taste of an unexplored future, its output was influential, helping to define and platform the burgeoning genre of hyperpop, while spreading its tentacles across pop via major label acts such as Charli XCX and Dua Lipa.\n\nAt first, though, people were suspicious. In a world of authenticity and battles over \"real music\", PC Music's artists were accused of being fake. \"The UK was very worried that we all secretly hated pop music, or that we'd enter the room just to take the piss,\" Cook says. \"That was the undertone. Whereas a lot of PC Music and affiliated artists were let into interesting places in the US: actual writing rooms, in with other producers on artist projects.\"\n\nThe argument over legitimacy feels less relevant in a pop landscape that has been flattened by the rise of streaming, with genres blended together and the pop versus indie debate all but nullified. With less to stand in opposition to, perhaps it made sense for Cook to shutter PC Music in 2023, its 10th year in operation (it will now be dedicated to special reissues). The announcement was accompanied by a special 100-minute-long playlist featuring the likes of label signees and professional noise merchants EasyFun and Umru. \"I saw it as the most PC Music thing to do ... To put out an emblematic statement with old and new music and start planting the seeds of some collaborations with other organisations, even on a museum level, or an artist level, or on a gig level.\"\n\nIn any case, Cook doesn't really have time to be a label head any more. He's been heavily involved in Charli XCX's forthcoming album Brat, continuing a creative relationship that started in 2017, plus he's keen to do more ad-hoc production for pop's biggest megastars - even if it means working in some quite unusual conditions. His involvement in Beyoncé's album Renaissance certainly was that: done remotely, it involved him being asked to sign an NDA (which ultimately never materialised) and then not knowing whether his contribution to the track All Up in Your Mind would even be used until days before the album's release: \"It was fascinating, and it led to me being Grammy nominated, but it was really a window into something from a very strange vantage point.\"\n\nThe idea for Cook's new album was formulated while he was living in remote Montana during the pandemic with his American musician girlfriend, Alaska Reid. \"I was the only British person there and having that sense of being a bit of an alien,\" he explains. He became fascinated with the British references that would still emerge, from the heraldry on a ranch cowboy belt that nodded to \"the Arthurian ideal\", to seminal American authors such as Steinbeck \"tapping into an imagined version of Britain, or England\". Suddenly geographical and historical boundaries were exploded. \"So a way of digging into what an AG Cook album could be was to use this as a strange launching pad, finding this thing that's slightly too loaded.\"\n\nIn fact, events back home made him question the title. \"There's Brexit, which is obviously fucked, and even when the Queen died I was like, 'OK, is this going to be too loaded, what is this?' And let alone people who are fans of OG Britpop.\" (For the record, Cook, who was born in 1990, prefers Blur over Oasis.) But the title was more about exploring semantics than jingoism. \"What I liked about Britpop as a word is that both sides of it are paradoxical,\" he says. \"People can't agree on what pop is, and then there's obviously Britain, and this constant ambiguity. You have the UK, Britain, the British Isles, all of these paradoxical territories and the strange history of all of that. It's an interesting word to hijack.\"\n\nFor all of Cook's mastery in conjuring up aural chaos - new songs such as Prismatic and Emerald sound like the noises you might hear if you spilled Sunny Delight on a circuit board - it's in Britpop's Present disc, which mainly features guitar and Cook's delicate, close-mic vocal, that the wizard behind the curtain is revealed. Its most revealing track is Without, a tender ode to the Grammy-nominated producer Sophie, Cook's close friend and collaborator who died suddenly in 2021. Sophie shared PC Music's love for synapse-snapping uber-pop, and rather than reflect on their friendship via an all-out sonic assault, Cook chose to make something akin to their early writing sessions, when songs were created over bare-boned backing tracks.\n\n\"Without was me trying to re-map out different memories, creating a mental shrine. It was such a strange and difficult time, really, but those things are so important to really process.\" He takes a sip of water. \"The conclusion was that I was ultimately so lucky to have spent so much time with someone who would resonate from such a different perspective. And obviously changed my life. That song was about processing that.\" Lost in thought, he answers a question I haven't asked. \"Sometimes it's weird when a Sophie song comes on in a club, but a lot of the time I'm just like: 'This is amazing music to celebrate to.' The music is so powerful it hasn't been tarnished by some of the pain I've had to go through to even think about it again.\"\n\nRelated: Charli XCX: 'People who take it too far are better than people who don't'\n\nIt is paradoxical in a very AG Cook way for there to be a portion of Britpop given over to the idea of \"real\" music, AKA a man and his guitar exploring emotions. To the naysayers, the playful electronic music, presented in fun ways, that is his stock in trade is anathema. For Cook growing up, however, it was the only way to grab his attention. An only child, he was obsessed with visual media, often reading instruction manuals, just \"fascinated by complexity and these exploded diagrams\". The only music that really cut through came via visually distinct worlds, such as those created by Gorillaz and Daft Punk. Having mastered visual software he then got into GarageBand, which meant he would often record and produce his friends' bands.\n\n\"Friends would be talking about how it wasn't like this other music, which is authentic, and has someone mastering their instrument,\" he laughs. \"Anyone involved in PC Music shared the same gripe about guilty pleasures, authenticity, all that stuff.\"\n\nDespite all the collaborations with pop megastars and like-minded oddballs, for now the indefatigable Cook's focus is purely on Britpop and the extended world he's building via Witchfork (sample news story: \"Travis' Fran Healy Says He Inspired David Beckham's 'Hoxton Fin' Mohawk\" by Pat Stool); his social media presence (one TikTok features him morphing into trite British signifiers such as a red bus); and the artwork's fantastical reimagining of the union jack. It's all part of where he sees pop going: branching off into diametrically opposed lanes of functionality on one side and theatre on the other. \"An unpredictable album, or something that only exists between albums, or the album becomes the entry but the true version is the campaign itself,\" he says, eyes widening at the thought of more mischief. \"Things that create this x and y axis of: 'What is going on?!'\"\n\nCreating moments of glorious confusion? It's something AG Cook is still exhaustively perfecting.",

        "text": "By complying with the decisions of European legislators, Apple would seem to be weakening its control over the creation and distribution of OS applications, but in reality it retains control levers. Let's take a closer look.\n\nWhile Google has always allowed Android users to install apps not only from the official Google Play Store, but also from third-party stores or via an APK file downloaded from a web, Apple is known for its closed iOS system that only works with apps from the App Store. Until now, it was impossible to install an app directly on an iPhone without getting it from the App Store or from one of Apple's approved marketplaces. However, the entry into force of new EU legislation on digital marketplaces is forcing Apple to become more flexible. What can the Cupertino corporation give up?\n\nIn fact, we are talking about Apple starting to follow Google's practices, at least on the European continent. Following alternative stores selling iPhones, iPads and other Apple products, the company announced the ability to install some applications directly from developer sites, without going through the Apple Store. With the iOS 17.4 update, which has been rolling out in the EU countries, Apple is allowing developers to provide third-party app stores that are direct competitors to the App Store. Direct installation will soon be possible.\n\nEligible developers will have access to Apple tools to make it easier to integrate their apps into iOS. \"Web Distribution, available in a software update later this spring, will let authorized developers distribute their iOS apps to EU users directly from a website the developer owns and operates. Apple will provide access to APIs that facilitate the distribution of developers' apps from the web, integrate with system functionality, back up and restore users' apps, and more,\" Apple said in an official announcement.\n\nThe changes in Apple's policy should not be understood in such a way that developers have complete freedom. The corporation will certainly strive to maintain maximum control over the distribution of applications on its operating system, and in particular to ensure that they comply with security requirements. Developers will be subject to the following membership criteria:\n\nIn addition, the iOS developer will also be required to contribute to the Apple Developer Program if the app sales exceed one million first annual installs per year, and, as well as aa CTF of €0.50 for each first annual install over one million in the past 12 months. Non-profit and educational only institutions or public institutions of the European Union will be exempt from these contributions.",

        "text": "Technology stocks had a great run in 2023. This year, not so much. In the past month, the tech-laden Nasdaq composite index has fallen 5%. Mega-cap tech stocks such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) have faltered badly amid escalating concerns that interest rates will remain higher for longer. Possibly much longer. At the same time, notable tech leaders such as Apple appear in rapid decline, having lost their competitive edge and market share.\n\nIn time, the market and tech stocks will almost certainly get their mojo back. However, there look to be some technology companies that are facing existential threats that could eventually see them pushed out of business. Threats are taking the form of increased competition, disruptive technologies, and changing consumer tastes. History is littered with once mighty companies that lost their edge and never regained it.\n\nHere are three tech stocks that could be heading six-feet under.\n\nThe stock of Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) hasn't been the same since privately held OpenAI (the company behind ChatGPT) introduced Sora, an AI platform that can generate videos based on written descriptions. OpenAI's Sora platform competes directly against many of Adobe's creative software products and concerns are mounting that AI will ultimately put the company out of business. ADBE stock is down nearly 20% on the year following Sora's debut and after the company issued weak forward guidance.\n\nAdobe, whose suite of creative software products includes Photoshop and Illustrator, did manage to beat Wall Street forecasts with its latest earnings. However, the company forecast earnings of $4.35 to $4.40 a share and revenue of $5.25 billion to $5.30 billion for the current second quarter. That fell short of expected earnings of $4.38 a share and $5.31 billion in revenue, sending ADBE stock down 12% in a single trading session. Adobe is adding AI where it can, unveiling a new AI assistant for its Reader and Acrobat apps.\n\nIn a move that looks like it is waving the white flag, Adobe is reportedly now exploring a partnership with OpenAI and looking to add Sora's technology to its products. The question is: will it be enough?\n\nAre things suddenly better at Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)? On the day of this writing, TSLA stock is up 12% as investors cheer the company's plan to rush a more affordable electric vehicle to market. However, the euphoria over a cheaper electric car overlooks the fact that Tesla's latest earnings print was terrible and showed that things are getting worse at the company. Much worse. For this year's first quarter, Tesla reported its biggest revenue decline since 2012 as it missed Wall Street's targets across the board.\n\nSales were down 9% from a year ago, while Tesla's net income plunged 55% year-over-year. Tesla also issued a dismal outlook for the remainder of the year, stating that its \"volume growth rate may be notably lower than the growth rate achieved in 2023.\" Tesla continues to struggle with slowing electric vehicle sales and rising competition that has forced it to slash prices at the expense of profit margins. As for the more affordable EV, Tesla is famous for overpromising and underdelivering. Any sign of the \"Tesla Bot\" yet?\n\nDespite the post-earnings lift, TSLA stock remains down 35% on the year and continues to be one of the worst performing stocks in the benchmark S&P 500 index.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD) has been trying to merge with another entertainment company or possibly sell itself as its stock slides lower. At the start of this year, the company was in merger talks with Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA), although the negotiations were called off in February. Warner Bros. is trying to achieve economies of scale as it struggles to earn profits from streaming while grappling with a decline in advertising revenue at its linear TV stations and dwindling audience attendance at movie theaters.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery is also labouring under a crushing debt load. While the company paid down $5.4 billion of debt in 2023, it still has $44.20 billion of debt remaining following its 2022 merger with Discovery Inc. Warner Bros. most recent earnings print was bad, with the company reporting a loss of 16 cents a share compared to a loss of 7 cents that was expected among analysts. Revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 came in at $10.28 billion, which was below forecasts of $10.35 billion.\n\nThe litany of problems has weighed heavily on WBD stock, which is down 66% in the two years since Warner Bros Discovery was formed.",

You're not alone.\n\nThe majority of iOS users will now see that the layout of WhatsApp on their phones are green-themed - a change that has been made 15 years after its introduction to the Apple Store.\n\nAndroid fans will be left unbothered though, as they have always had a green interface - iPhone was known for having a deep blue theme, keeping in line with the general interface colours on Apple products.\n\nThe chat-list window, the status bar, notifications in your settings, it's all gone through a major revamp, now donning the green that is associated with the messaging app.\n\nTo add more insult to injury, even links that are sent in chats will be green coloured, instead of the old blue - this might be a step too far.\n\nThough, Meta previously stated that they were going to bring a 'modern, new experience to WhatsApp and make it more accessible as well as easier to use,' through its changes.\n\nThey also said in a report: \"We've made some changes to how WhatsApp looks and feels, including spacing, colours, icons and more.\"\n\nAs expected, the meltdown on social media has ensued, with several users making their annoyance at the changes known on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nOne user posted: \"That new green for whatsapp is ugly especially in dark mode!! Change back to Blue please,\" with a crying emoji.\n\nAnother put: \"I miss my blue WhatsApp, this green version is just irritating.\"\n\nA third said: \"With this new green update on WhatsApp, it feels like everyone from my local plumber to extended family has added me in their close friends list.\"",

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 were set to open higher thanks to the Big Tech giants' strong results.\n\nAlphabet stock surged ahead of Friday's opening bell as investors cheered the Google owner's blowout first-quarter earnings.\n\nShares were up 11% to almost $174 shortly before 5 a.m. ET. If those gains hold until the opening bell, its valuation will top $2 trillion for the first time.\n\nThe stock climbed higher after Alphabet posted earnings for the three months to March 31 after Thursday's close with profits and revenue that both smashed analysts' forecasts.\n\nThe announcement that it would follow the lead of rivals including Microsoft, Apple, and Meta by issuing its first dividend also served as a green light for the market.\n\n\"Alphabet joining the ranks of tech companies paying dividends is a sign of the times,\" AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said. \"Big tech firms have enjoyed stellar growth over the past decade and while most remain highly innovative, their cash flows have become so strong that there's oodles of money left over post-reinvestment in the business to reward shareholders.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Microsoft stock made more modest gains after it reported first-quarter earnings on Thursday afternoon.\n\nShares were up almost in pre-market trading, putting its market capitalization on course to jump about $11 billion at the opening bell back above $3 trillion. It first hit that milestone back in January following a 207% surge over the past five years.\n\nMicrosoft said it plans to ramp up spending on artificial intelligence and cloud services to take advantage of the AI boom.\n\nCFO Amy Hood said on a post-earnings call with analysts that spending would increase \"materially,\" adding that the company's AI capacity hadn't kept pace with soaring demand.\n\nMicrosoft has emerged as one of the major winners from the AI boom due to its close relationship with OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT.\n\n\"The path to AI monetization is clearest for Microsoft,\" Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said.\n\n\"Its substantial AI investments have driven gains in its formidable cloud business, and its other products are also easily kitted out with AI additions.

        "text": "As multi-cap investors, we believe owning businesses of all sizes provides the greatest potential opportunity set for long-term outperformance.\n\nThe Partners III Opportunity Fund's Institutional Class returned +8.21% in the first quarter of 2024 compared to +10.02% for the Russell 3000 Index. For the 12-month period ended March 31, 2024, the Fund's Institutional Class returned +23.19% compared to +29.29% for the index.\n\nEquities continued to rally in the first quarter, generating strong absolute returns for Fund shareholders and pushing many market indices to all-time highs. The Fund's 12-month returns were similarly positive, and we were pleased to report strong, absolute returns, despite falling short of the Russell 3000 in both periods.\n\nAs multi-cap investors, we believe owning businesses of all sizes provides the greatest potential opportunity set for long-term outperformance. However, in recent years, large- and mega-cap companies have consistently outperformed the rest of the market cap spectrum. Befitting our strategy, we hold many investments in the large-cap space, including four of the market's Magnificent Seven (Alphabet, Inc. (GOOG), Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)) and indirectly a fifth, (Apple, Inc. (AAPL), via Berkshire Hathaway, Inc.'s (BRK.B) sizeable position), and the Fund benefited accordingly.\n\nOur small- and medium-sized businesses also performed well, but simply did not keep pace with the large market leaders. As a result, we are not surprised by having lagged the capitalization-weighted Russell 3000, as it is dominated by the same mega-cap stocks that have fueled the large-cap Russell 1000 Index. Of course, while we aspire for long-term outperformance in any environment, periods of small- and/or mid-cap companies could provide a relative performance tailwind for our portfolio compared to the \"top-heavy\" Russell 3000.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway, Meta Platforms and Amazon were mega-cap winners and top\n\ncontributors in the first quarter, although small-cap Perimeter Solutions SA's (PRM) 61% gain made it the Fund's strongest performing stock on an absolute basis. Perimeter's sole material competitor for wildfire retardants was forced to withdraw their product due to corrosive damage to the airtankers used to deploy it. Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (FIS) also earned top marks in the quarter. FIS completed the sale of its majority stake in Worldpay Merchant Solutions in January, and the company is paying down debt and repurchasing stock with the proceeds.\n\nLiberty Broadband Corp. (LBRDA) (a holding company that owns 32% of broadband provider Charter Communications, Inc. (CHTR)) was the Fund's primary detractor. Charter has been a multi-quarter laggard as increased competition from wireless broadband alternatives has dampened subscriber growth, while elevated network upgrade and expansion spending have depressed current cash flows in favor of future returns. Adding to these woes, management disclosed that roughly five million of its broadband customers receive a federal subsidy that will expire in April. We anticipate that Charter will retain many, if not most, of these subscribers and that the financial impact will be manageable. Despite yet another near-term challenge, we continue to believe Charter is an example of a good idea that has not worked yet. We added to our exposure by initiating a position directly in Charter shares, partially offset by modest tax-loss harvesting at Liberty Broadband. Joining Liberty Broadband and Charter in the penalty box were CoreCard Corp. (CCRD), Liberty Global Ltd. (LBTYK), and our short position against the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) which tracks the S&P 500 Index.\n\nPerformance was broadly strong across the portfolio during the fiscal year, led by Meta Platforms which saw its stock price more than double. Our top four performers for the fiscal year - Meta Platforms, Berkshire Hathaway, Amazon and Alphabet - each contributed in excess of 2% to the Fund's overall return, with our fifth-highest contributor missing that same distinction by mere basis points. On the other side of the ledger, CoreCard was a top detractor for the quarter and fiscal year. After months of rumors, it was confirmed that the company's largest customer, Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS), would exit the consumer credit card business. CoreCard processes payments for Goldman's large card clients, including Apple Card, and will continue to do so until Goldman transitions its clients to a new operator. The transition will take time (quarters, maybe years), giving management (and us) time to assess the company's next steps. Liberty Broadband's dismal first quarter earned it a spot as a top detractor for the fiscal year along with our S&P 500 ETF Index short position. Fellow detractor Liberty Global has announced plans to separately list its Swiss business and is examining other steps to unlock the latent value in its shares. Finally, despite the strong first quarter showing, Perimeter Solutions was a modest detractor for the fiscal year.\n\nPortfolio activity tilted toward valuation-driven trims during the first quarter, including Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Amazon, as well as exiting our multi-year, profitable investment in Markel Group, Inc. (MKL). As mentioned previously, we trimmed some Liberty Broadband to harvest tax losses while increasing our overall economic exposure by initiating a position directly in Charter shares (our only new holding this quarter). At quarter-end, our gross long position was 93%, down modestly from 95% at the end of December 2023. Our short position increased from 4% to roughly 5% of gross assets, resulting in a net long position of approximately 87%.\n\nData is for the quarter ending 03/31/2024.

        "text": "(Reuters) -Microsoft beat Wall Street estimates for third-quarter revenue and profit on Thursday, driven by gains from adoption of artificial intelligence across its cloud services, and the company's shares jumped more than 4% in extended trade.\n\nExecutives forecast ranges for current quarter cloud revenue that were mostly above Wall Street targets.\n\nThe rise in Microsoft shares after the bell lifted the company's stock market value by $128 billion as profit and revenue growth overshadowed its higher-than-expected capital expenditures. In contrast, Facebook and Instagram parent Meta's market capitalization fell by $200 billion on Wednesday after it warned of rising AI expenses and issued a lower-than-anticipated revenue forecast.\n\n\"Microsoftâs AI-powered earnings demonstrate that doubling down on innovation is paying off,\" said Jeremy Goldman, senior director of briefings at Emarketer, pointing to the company's early moves in generative AI, such as its large investment in ChatGPT maker OpenAI.\n\nMicrosoft revenue rose 17% to $61.9 billion in the quarter ended March, exceeding the consensus estimate of $60.80 billion, according to LSEG data. Earnings per share of $2.94 topped Wall Street's target of $2.82.\n\nAt the same time, Microsoft's AI-driven capital expenditures in the third quarter were nearly $1 billion more than analysts' estimates. Capital expenditures grew from $11.5 billion in the previous quarter to $14 billion, passing estimates of $13.14 billion, according to Visible Alpha.\n\n\"We're continuing to see customer demand grow quite a bit,\" Brett Iversen, Microsoft's vice president of investor relations told Reuters. \"And so we're making sure to scale our available capacity in line with that.\"\n\nThe stock has soared on Microsoft shipping generative AI (genAI) tools based on its strategic partnership with OpenAI and also helped it capture the world's most valuable company crown from Apple this year. Microsoft has special access to OpenAI's coveted AI technologies, which it has been working to infuse across its product portfolio, such as in Azure, Bing and also Microsoft 365, which includes Word, Excel, and Powerpoint.\n\nRevenue from Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud unit, which houses the Azure cloud computing platform, rose to $26.7 billion, passing the average estimate of $26.24 billion, LSEG data showed.\n\nIt forecast fourth quarter intelligent cloud revenue of $28.4-28.7 billion, mostly ahead of Wall Street targets of $28.47 billion.\n\nAzure revenue rose 31%, higher than a 29% growth estimate from market research firm Visible Alpha. Microsoft forecast Azure growth in the fiscal fourth quarter would be 30%-31%, which would put it ahead of the 28.5% Wall Street target.\n\nMicrosoft does not break out the absolute revenue figure for Azure, the part of its business best situated to capitalize on booming interest in artificial intelligence.\n\nThe Copilot tool, a set of genAI assistants launched in November for $30 a month, has lifted Microsoft's enterprise software and Windows businesses. A recovery in personal computer sales was also a factor.\n\nThe More Personal Computing unit revenue increased 17% to $15.6 billion, surpassing analyst expectations of $15.08 billion, according to data from LSEG.\n\nProductivity and Business Processes, Microsoft's unit that houses office software and LinkedIn, increased revenue 12% to $19.6 billion. Analysts had estimated $19.54 billion, according to data from LSEG.\n\n(Reporting by Yuvraj Malik in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila and David Gregorio)",

        "text": "As the boss of PC Music, the godfather of hyperpop confounded critics but won over Beyoncé and Charli XCX. Now, with a supersized new solo album, he's continuing his mission to make pop more unpredictable\n\nEverything about AG Cook is exhausting. As a producer of elasticated outre pop his output is as varied as it is frenetic, taking in everything from bass-rattling electronic workouts for cultural behemoths such as Beyoncé to celestial dreamscapes for underground newcomers, via collaborations with Caroline Polachek and longterm partner in crime, Charli XCX. Having initially steered clear of solo albums to focus on running his divisive yet hugely influential label PC Music, Cook's debut, 2020's 7G, featured 49 tracks and more than two hours of music ranging from face-melting dance experiments to a lo-fi Sia cover. Apple, a more streamlined, but no less polarising followup arrived a month later.\n\nHis hard drive somehow still not yet full, Cook is now back with his third album Britpop, a three-part, 24-song opus split into Past, Present and Future sections. As part of its promotion he's been busy creating TikToks and launching his own parody website Witchfork, billed as \"the least trusted voice in music\". \"It's obviously embracing some troll behaviour, which has always been a bit of a thread for me personally,\" he laughs.\n\nIf this all sounds like a lot of work, it makes more sense when you meet its creator. Across our hour-long video call Cook barely stops talking, with tangents taking in everything from Brexit to S Club 7's 00s TV shows (\"I'm very familiar with their version of media and reality,\" he says with genuine enthusiasm). A simple question like, \"Where are you now?\" (short version: he's in LA, but frequently returns to his home town of London) quickly unspools into a lengthy answer about his position in the pop cosmos.\n\n\"I work with people who are involved in pop music at a high level and they see me as a weirdo who's ready to inject some strange thing,\" he says, his kinetic energy making his shoulder-length hair bob about excitedly. \"Then I work with my friends who are doing club nights and they see me as the mainstream guy who has experience working with bigger artists. So for someone on that fault line, LA is a really interesting place. I can dip into different things and push my own perspective.\"\n\nThat position in the pop cosmos was assured by PC Music. Launched in 2013, the label covered the pop landscape - then dominated by beige stars such as Ed Sheeran and Emeli Sandé - in metallic neon. Cook oversaw, and often co-produced, the output of fellow oddballs such as Danny L Harle, GFOTY and Hannah Diamond, creating a synthetic, saccharine sound that was combined with stylised visual presentation to match. Unironically referencing so-called \"guilty pleasures\" of the past (90s German happy hardcore outfit Scooter, for example) while giving a taste of an unexplored future, its output was influential, helping to define and platform the burgeoning genre of hyperpop, while spreading its tentacles across pop via major label acts such as Charli XCX and Dua Lipa.\n\nAt first, though, people were suspicious. In a world of authenticity and battles over \"real music\", PC Music's artists were accused of being fake. \"The UK was very worried that we all secretly hated pop music, or that we'd enter the room just to take the piss,\" Cook says. \"That was the undertone. Whereas a lot of PC Music and affiliated artists were let into interesting places in the US: actual writing rooms, in with other producers on artist projects.\"\n\nThe argument over legitimacy feels less relevant in a pop landscape that has been flattened by the rise of streaming, with genres blended together and the pop versus indie debate all but nullified. With less to stand in opposition to, perhaps it made sense for Cook to shutter PC Music in 2023, its 10th year in operation (it will now be dedicated to special reissues). The announcement was accompanied by a special 100-minute-long playlist featuring the likes of label signees and professional noise merchants EasyFun and Umru. \"I saw it as the most PC Music thing to do ... To put out an emblematic statement with old and new music and start planting the seeds of some collaborations with other organisations, even on a museum level, or an artist level, or on a gig level.\"\n\nIn any case, Cook doesn't really have time to be a label head any more. He's been heavily involved in Charli XCX's forthcoming album Brat, continuing a creative relationship that started in 2017, plus he's keen to do more ad-hoc production for pop's biggest megastars - even if it means working in some quite unusual conditions. His involvement in Beyoncé's album Renaissance certainly was that: done remotely, it involved him being asked to sign an NDA (which ultimately never materialised) and then not knowing whether his contribution to the track All Up in Your Mind would even be used until days before the album's release: \"It was fascinating, and it led to me being Grammy nominated, but it was really a window into something from a very strange vantage point.\"\n\nThe idea for Cook's new album was formulated while he was living in remote Montana during the pandemic with his American musician girlfriend, Alaska Reid. \"I was the only British person there and having that sense of being a bit of an alien,\" he explains. He became fascinated with the British references that would still emerge, from the heraldry on a ranch cowboy belt that nodded to \"the Arthurian ideal\", to seminal American authors such as Steinbeck \"tapping into an imagined version of Britain, or England\". Suddenly geographical and historical boundaries were exploded. \"So a way of digging into what an AG Cook album could be was to use this as a strange launching pad, finding this thing that's slightly too loaded.\"\n\nIn fact, events back home made him question the title. \"There's Brexit, which is obviously fucked, and even when the Queen died I was like, 'OK, is this going to be too loaded, what is this?' And let alone people who are fans of OG Britpop.\" (For the record, Cook, who was born in 1990, prefers Blur over Oasis.) But the title was more about exploring semantics than jingoism. \"What I liked about Britpop as a word is that both sides of it are paradoxical,\" he says. \"People can't agree on what pop is, and then there's obviously Britain, and this constant ambiguity. You have the UK, Britain, the British Isles, all of these paradoxical territories and the strange history of all of that. It's an interesting word to hijack.\"\n\nFor all of Cook's mastery in conjuring up aural chaos - new songs such as Prismatic and Emerald sound like the noises you might hear if you spilled Sunny Delight on a circuit board - it's in Britpop's Present disc, which mainly features guitar and Cook's delicate, close-mic vocal, that the wizard behind the curtain is revealed. Its most revealing track is Without, a tender ode to the Grammy-nominated producer Sophie, Cook's close friend and collaborator who died suddenly in 2021. Sophie shared PC Music's love for synapse-snapping uber-pop, and rather than reflect on their friendship via an all-out sonic assault, Cook chose to make something akin to their early writing sessions, when songs were created over bare-boned backing tracks.\n\n\"Without was me trying to re-map out different memories, creating a mental shrine. It was such a strange and difficult time, really, but those things are so important to really process.\" He takes a sip of water. \"The conclusion was that I was ultimately so lucky to have spent so much time with someone who would resonate from such a different perspective. And obviously changed my life. That song was about processing that.\" Lost in thought, he answers a question I haven't asked. \"Sometimes it's weird when a Sophie song comes on in a club, but a lot of the time I'm just like: 'This is amazing music to celebrate to.' The music is so powerful it hasn't been tarnished by some of the pain I've had to go through to even think about it again.\"\n\nIt is paradoxical in a very AG Cook way for there to be a portion of Britpop given over to the idea of \"real\" music, AKA a man and his guitar exploring emotions. To the naysayers, the playful electronic music, presented in fun ways, that is his stock in trade is anathema. For Cook growing up, however, it was the only way to grab his attention. An only child, he was obsessed with visual media, often reading instruction manuals, just \"fascinated by complexity and these exploded diagrams\". The only music that really cut through came via visually distinct worlds, such as those created by Gorillaz and Daft Punk. Having mastered visual software he then got into GarageBand, which meant he would often record and produce his friends' bands.\n\n\"Friends would be talking about how it wasn't like this other music, which is authentic, and has someone mastering their instrument,\" he laughs. \"Anyone involved in PC Music shared the same gripe about guilty pleasures, authenticity, all that stuff.\"\n\nDespite all the collaborations with pop megastars and like-minded oddballs, for now the indefatigable Cook's focus is purely on Britpop and the extended world he's building via Witchfork (sample news story: \"Travis' Fran Healy Says He Inspired David Beckham's 'Hoxton Fin' Mohawk\" by Pat Stool); his social media presence (one TikTok features him morphing into trite British signifiers such as a red bus); and the artwork's fantastical reimagining of the union jack. It's all part of where he sees pop going: branching off into diametrically opposed lanes of functionality on one side and theatre on the other. \"An unpredictable album, or something that only exists between albums, or the album becomes the entry but the true version is the campaign itself,\" he says, eyes widening at the thought of more mischief. \"Things that create this x and y axis of: 'What is going on?!'\"\n\nCreating moments of glorious confusion? It's something AG Cook is still exhaustively perfecting.",

        "text": "Strix Point looks very sharp, while Strix Point Halo looks positively vorpal\n\nThere's been a mammoth leak of AMD's incoming CPUs that covers the Strix Point and Strix Point Halo APUs, processors with integrated graphics that are an all-in-one solution saving you the cost of buying a separate GPU.\n\nArm yourself with your favored complement of cautionary items applied around rumors - your hat of wariness and staff of skepticism, perhaps - as this one comes from a post on X (formerly Twitter) that has since been deleted. Hong Kong-based tech site HKEPC captured all the details before the post was removed, though (as flagged by VideoCardz).\n\nCredits and cautions out of the way, this is supposedly an official document, and it is huge. We're talking 144 pages apparently, showing what we can expect from both Strix Point APUs, and the top-end Strix Point Halo chips that will follow them. Much of it underlines previous rumors, but there's some interesting new info here too.\n\nThe leaked material indicates that these with be Zen 5-based chips with RDNA 3.5 (aka RDNA 3+) refreshed graphics, and next-gen XDNA 2 for the NPU. (Yes, these chips are actually 3-in-1s, as it were, that come with a CPU, GPU, and also an NPU now that we're in the age of the AI PC).\n\nStrix Halo APUs will be available in up to 16-core (32-thread) configurations, featuring 40 CUs for its integrated RDNA 3.5 graphics, and 32MB of MALL cache for that integrated GPU. As speculation previously suggested, the 16-core flagship will actually be a pair of chiplets (2 x 8-cores).\n\nFor AI performance, we can expect the NPU of the Halo range to reach 60 TOPS (trillions of operations per second), which is seriously beefy.\n\nWith Strix Point vanilla, we're supposedly getting up to 12-core (24-thread) APUs armed with a GPU featuring 16 CUs and AI processing chops to the tune of 50 TOPS.\n\nThose are some pretty nippy specs, and the NPUs and GPUs in particular look seriously promising. Notably, the TOPS ratings shared are just for the NPU, and don't represent the combined AI processing capabilities of the APU. 60 TOPS (for Halo) and 50 TOPS (Strix Point vanilla) are nippy speeds for NPUs, and even the latter figure outguns the much-talked-about Snapdragon X Elite (at 45 TOPS).\n\nQualcomm is definitely talking up a great game with that incoming Snapdragon X Elite - and rightly so from what we've seen, to be fair - but remember, AMD's Strix Point should land later this year, and maybe Apple's M4 too. So, before too long, the competition will be a lot more fierce in the land of the best laptops.\n\nApple may well be worried about Strix Point, too, particularly Halo which could power some excellent MacBook Pro rivals. With that integrated GPU in particular, Strix Point Halo looks like a monster. As we've discussed before, if the AMD flagship has 40 CUs, that considerably outpowers the existing RX 7600 XT (at 32 CUs), and remember, the incoming APU has a faster tweaked RDNA 3 architecture too. The mentioned 32MB of MALL cache should speed up things even further as the cherry on top. (HKEPC mentions that this should function similarly to AMD's Infinity Cache in pepping up performance).\n\nWe were already excited about the Halo silicon especially, and this does nothing to pour any cold water on that particular fire - though bear in mind, Strix Point Halo won't turn up until later (2025), or that's the theory. Apple and Qualcomm, and Intel too of course, watch out...",

Significantly, Huawei returned to the top spot after 13 quarters, shipping 11.7 million smartphones and capturing a 17% market share, thanks to an enthusiastic market response to its Mate and nova series. OPPO rose to second place, driven by its Reno 11 series' strong performance, shipping 10.9 million units. Conversely, following a strong Q4 last year, HONOR, vivo and Apple slowed their sell-ins this quarter, and ranked third, fourth and fifth respectively. HONOR was third with 10.6 million units, with a year-on-year increase of 9%. vivo ranked fourth with 10.3 million units and saw a year-on-year decrease of 9%. Apple declined the most among the top five, with 10.0 million units, a year-on-year decrease of 25%.\n\nCanalys Senior Analyst Toby Zhu commented, \"The mainland China market's growth is still behind the global recovery of 11%, which allowed Huawei to seize market share and reclaim the crown quickly. The production and supply shortage of the Mate 60 series improved in the first quarter, propelling it to become the key driver of Huawei's overall growth. In addition to the high-end lineup, Huawei released the nova 12 series in December, which features Harmony 4.0, expanding the Kirin chipset to more product lines and successfully boosting performance in the mid-range price band. This month Huawei also upgraded the P series to Pura 70, featuring an innovative pop-out camera lens, further sparking market interest. A key strategy for Huawei in 2024 is to focus on building AI capabilities for smart devices from hardware to software at a system level, leveraging its deep R&D capabilities in AI infrastructure and solutions for industry and enterprise customers. With the continued expansion of the HarmonyOS ecosystem, Huawei emerges as the third OS for smartphones and other edge computing devices, breaking the two-horse race of Android and iOS in Mainland China.\"\n\nCanalys Research Manager Amber Liu added, \"Despite Huawei's strong start, we maintain the modest recovery forecast for overall market performance in 2024 growing at 1%. The talking point within the industry surrounds intensifying competition and innovation moat building. Leading vendors are narrowing their market share, which means exploring growth opportunities in different channels is critical to capture short-term opportunities. Vendors' go-to-market capabilities in multi-channel management, price control, and inventory management will be tested.\"\n\n\"The Gen AI-capable smartphone presents important opportunities for Chinese vendors to differentiate in the high-end in 2024 to challenge Apple in their home market,\" said Canalys Research Analyst Lucas Zhong. \"Canalys forecasts Gen AI-capable smartphones will reach 12% of shipments in 2024 in mainland China, ahead of the global average of 9%. Vendors are actively engaging consumers by developing interesting AI use cases and integrating AI features into their latest flagship launches with large marketing spends to educate consumers. In Q1, Xiaomi led in the Gen AI-capable smartphone market with its flagship 14 series, while HONOR explored its high-profile Magic 6 series with cross-device AI features with its MagicBook Pro 16. OPPO, on the other hand, pushed ahead with massive marketing investments on national TV channels, positioning its brand with AI features and innovation. We see an increasing divergence in Chinese vendors' R&D and AI product strategies this year, collectively driving further consumer awareness and adoption, which will feed into a sustainable monetization model.\"",

While the email had little heft to it, given the circumstances, we presumed that the email was an error on Apple's part. However, there is now an update to the story as the company has sent another email to the same members, asking them to disregard their previous email.\n\nInitially, Apple's email stated to customers that it did not receive the iPhone for trade-in, however, this was not the case as users had submitted their devices months ago. Some users handed their iPhones over to Apple physically, which further pointed out that the fault could rest at Apple's end. Apple's email blatantly stated, \"Because you didn't trade in your iPhone, we are unable to complete the trade-in process\" (via MacRumors).\n\nHowever, the email was not the end of it as users also reported that their Apple Store app also showed their trade-in as canceled. What this means is that there appears to be an issue with the entire system and that the emails were not a mistake but a glitch. Users have also reported their concerns on Reddit and X, highlighting the issue and the email that canceled their trade-in process.\n\nWhile it was a system glitch, Apple has taken note of the situation and has issued a statement, asking users to disregard their previous email. Apple states that the email was sent erroneously and those who received it should not take any action on it. Later on, the company sent another email to affected customers, stating that users should dismiss the previous email. However, the company failed to provide a reason for the glitch and if it was a system-wide error.\n\nIf you are one of the people who received the email that their iPhone trade-in has been canceled, we would advise you to update and refresh the status of the process. Potentially, Apple would have fixed the 'canceled' error in the Apple Store app as well. Additionally, if you are planning to trade in your iPhone but are reluctant to do so due to the issue, you can safely resume and hand over your iPhone to Apple.\n\nApple will announce the new iPhone 16 models later this year and if it suits your preferences, you can trade in your current iPhone right now. You do have the option to trade in your iPhone closer to the launch as well if you want to upgrade to the latest. We will keep you posted on the story, so do stick around.",

These days, Meta now has sizable competition with Apple now that the Vision Pro is here. If VR (or \"spatial computing,\" as Apple insists on calling it) is to be a thing, Meta needs to drive more user adoption of VR devices. Clearly, even tens of billions of dollars of research and development spent on its Realty Labs segment won't simply do the trick.\n\nTo that end, Meta announced it's opening up its VR platform to third-party developers -- for both hardware and apps. Meta said this open ecosystem will be built on Horizon OS. Tech companies can now utilize Meta's extensive VR headset technology, human-machine interaction capabilities like hand and body movement tracking and real-world sensing to build their own hardware and apps on Horizon OS.\n\nThink of Horizon OS as Meta's VR metaverse operating system like the equivalent to Microsoft's Windows OS for PC or Alphabet's Android OS for mobile. Up until this point, Meta has developed most of its VR headsets, the Quest 3 being the latest, in-house. App development has also been done mostly by in-house studios, with third-party app developers working on an invite basis.\n\nIt would seem that Meta is looking to monetize all of its tech development via licensing deals to computing device companies, as well as, more broadly, opening up app development and monetization. Per Meta's news release:\n\n\"Developers and creators can take advantage of all these technologies to create mixed reality experiences. And they can reach their audiences and grow their businesses through the content discovery and monetization platforms built into Meta Horizon OS, including the Meta Quest Store, which we'll rename the Meta Horizon Store.\"\n\nPut simply, a flood of new VR innovations could be coming our way in the near future.\n\nMeta is now sitting on years of elevated expenses in its Reality Labs segment. Meta has actually been quite transparent with those operating losses in the last five years. The segment has bled some $55 billion since 2019.\n\nData source: Meta.\n\nThose operating losses are incredible, even for Meta's mighty social media profit machine. Operating margin in the first quarter dialed in at 38% on total revenue of $36.5 billion -- the vast majority of that from social media ads, of course. Now imagine a Meta where VR isn't a major drag.\n\nIt's clear that one of the top ways Zuckerberg's \"year of efficiency\" can be extended into 2024 and beyond is to help transform Reality Labs into a component that's pulling its own weight. Turning all of the virtual reality and metaverse tech into a revenue-generating ecosystem of third-party developers could be a semi-fast-track to doing just that, although management said to expect Reality Labs operating losses to deepen \"meaningfully\" later this year.\n\nFor now, with efficiency gains from last year still boosting expected earnings growth in 2024, Meta stock still looks reasonably priced. Shares trade for about 20 times Wall Street analysts' expectation for 2024 earnings. I remain a happy shareholder.",

Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun took to social media to share the news. The SU7 is the brand's first car, unveiled in late 2023, that has been the subject of widespread interest from all around the world ever since. One of the main talking points about the car recently has been its accessible price tag in the domestic market, currently ranging from RMB 215,900 (approx. Rs 24.90 lakh) to RMB 299,900 (approx. Rs 34.59 lakh). Deliveries of the car have already commenced, with the CEO stating Xiaomi has delivered 5,781 vehicles to date.\n\nXiaomi CEO Lei Jun talking at the 2024 Beijing Auto Show\n\nInterestingly, Jun also revealed 79 per cent of the car's owners regularly use Xiaomi Pilot, the car's autonomous driving function. Jun also mentioned the car received 28 per cent of its orders from female customers. Moving forward, the company expects women to make up 40 to 50 per cent of the car's owners base. The brand also stated that a few orders came from customers who previously owned a luxury car from the likes of Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Audi, although it didn't reveal a number or percentage for the same. There was also a high number of bookings from customers who owned an Apple product (one of Xiaomi's competitors in the consumer tech market), with 51.9 per cent of bookings coming from such customers.\n\nIn its top-spec guise, the SU7 can clock 0 to 100 kmph in 2.78 seconds\n\nThe SU7 is equipped with Xiaomi's 'Super Motor', which can rev to 21,000 rpm. In the entry SU7, it develops 295 bhp and 400 Nm of torque. The single-motor SU7 will do 0-100 kmph in 5.28 seconds and reach a top speed of 210 kmph. The dual-motor SU7 Max has the 'Super Motor V6S', which cumulatively develops a peak 664 bhp and 838 Nm of torque. With launch control, the SU7 Max will clock 0-100 kmph in 2.78 seconds, 0-200 kmph in 10.67 seconds and hit a top speed of 265 kmph.\n\nAlso Read: BYD Seal Electric Sedan Launched In India; Prices Start From Rs 41.00 Lakh\n\nThe entry SU7 has a 73.6 kWh pack, while the SU7 Max has a 101 kWh pack. The entry SU7 has a range of up to 668 kilometres, while the SU7 Max has a range of up to 800 kilometres (CLTC). Xiaomi says the SU7 Max will regain 220 km of range with a five-minute charge, and 510 km of range with a 15-minute charge when plugged into an ultra-fast charger.",

        "text": "Google and Microsoft rallied on Friday as the technology bellwethers showed that hefty investments into artificial intelligence could reap more immediate revenue returns, a sharp contrast to Meta Platforms' view that AI is a long-term bet.\n\nMicrosoft's shares advanced 3.84% in trading before the U.S. market opened after the company beat Wall Street estimates for third-quarter revenue and profit, driven by gains from the adoption of AI across its cloud services.\n\nGoogle-parent Alphabet soared an even-steeper 11.5%, poised to top $2 trillion in market value, after not only beating quarterly estimates, but also rewarding investors with its first-ever dividend and a $70 billion stock buyback plan.\n\nThat sparked a 1% to 3% rise in the shares of other big tech companies, including Amazon.com, Apple, Nvidia and even Meta Platforms, whose stock price tumbled over 10% on Thursday as the social media firm signalled its costly AI bets could take years to pay off.\n\nThe tech titans have been locked in a fierce battle in the race for generative AI, which can create text, videos and photos from prompts and is seen as the next frontier in tech. Analysts though are divided over whether Alphabet or Microsoft wears the AI crown.\n\n\"Microsoft continues to put together masterpiece after masterpiece as this quarter represents its dominant position in the AI Revolution,\" Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said.\n\nBut Scott Devitt, Ives' colleague at Wedbush said, \"We think the results further validate Google's position as a leading AI beneficiary.\"\n\nMicrosoft has access to OpenAI's coveted AI technologies, which it has been working to infuse across its product portfolio, such as in Bing, Microsoft 365 and, most importantly, the Azure cloud-computing platform.\n\n\"AI services contributed seven points of growth\" to the 31% jump in revenue from Azure, Microsoft finance chief Amy Hood said.\n\nWhile Goldman Sachs said Microsoft is well positioned to replicate the success of its Azure build-out playbook in its AI-laced suite, Oppenheimer predicted the company's AI dominance would be reminiscent of a couple of decades back.\n\n\"We see it revisiting its PC-era-type dominance, but of a 1000x larger market as it is the dominant AI platform for enterprises,\" analyst Timothy Horan said.\n\nOn the other hand, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai touted Google's AI offerings as a boon to its market-leading service -- core search results.\n\n\"Google's Q1 ranked somewhere north of outstanding ... and management appears in better control of its own AI narrative,\" said RBC analyst Khadijah Gibson.\n\n\"Aside from a similarly-sized capex guide up as Meta, Google is more than weathering the GenAI concerns.\"\n\nIf premarket gains hold, Alphabet, Wall Street's fourth-most valuable company, will cross $2 trillion in market value on an intraday basis -- a milestone it last hit, but failed to hold on to, three years ago, according to LSEG Datastream.\n\nThree of the so-called 'Big Six' have reported quarterly results so far. Of the remaining, Amazon, now the only one that does not pay a dividend, is due to report results next week.",

        "text": "BEIJING (AP) -- China's vision of the future of the automobile -- electrified and digitally connected -- is on display at the ongoing Beijing auto show.\n\nOrganizers say that 117 new models are making their debut at Auto China 2024, which runs through May 4. They range from eye-poppingly cutting edge to more subtle novelties.\n\nTHE CONNECTED CAR\n\nOne of the biggest mob scenes was for the opening day presentation by Xiaomi, a major Chinese maker of smartphones and trendy, affordable smart appliances aimed at younger generations that's entering the car market for the first time.\n\nXiaomi announced that it had received more than 75,000 orders in the four weeks since the launch of its first car, the SU7, with a list price of 215,900 to 299,900 yuan ($29,800-$41,400).\n\nWhy is a phone company making a car? Analysts say connectivity. Consumer technology companies want to connect the lives of their customers across all their devices -- phones, laptops, televisions and now cars.\n\n\"It starts with the concept of the third place,\" said Beatrix Keim, the China director at German auto research center CAR. \"Because nowadays people are at the office, at home and then mainly they're spending the time in the car.\"\n\nThe approach works well in China, a highly digital society where e-payments are the norm and the convenience of connectivity trumps privacy concerns for most.\n\nChinese telecom giant Huawei has ventured into the car business too. Apple explored the idea but dropped it earlier this year.\n\nTHE CAR AS LIVING SPACE\n\nSome Chinese makers are taking the idea of a third space to new heights.\n\nZeekr unveiled the Mix, an electric vehicle with an interior that can transform into a small room while parked. The front seats swivel to face the back ones, with a table in between that a company executive told the crowd could be used to play card games or enjoy a Chinese hot-pot meal.\n\nStefan Sielaff, the design director of Zeekr, described the Mix as \"a nice experiment\" focusing on younger families.\n\n\"I wouldn't even call it a car or an MPV or a van,\" he said. \"It's more a lifestyle capsule. It's an iPod on wheels.\"\n\nIt will be the fifth model for Zeekr, a 2 1/2-year-old premium EV brand of China's Geely group, a major maker that owns Volvo and has designers in Sweden and Shanghai.\n\nThe Mix will go on sale in China by the end of June, the company said. Its selling price has not been announced.\n\nTHE HYBRID APPROACH\n\nAn EV boom in China that started three years ago has eaten into the market for gasoline-powered cars, but they are not dead yet.\n\nSo says Chery Automobile Co., China's biggest exporter, which told its auto show audience that it would continue to develop gasoline cars as well as EVs and hybrids.\n\nIts EXEED Yaoguang C-DM, a hybrid SUV launched last month, was one of four vehicles it highlighted -- two hybrids and two EVs.\n\nThe Yaoguang SUV sells for 159,800 to 225,800 yuan ($22,000-$31,000) in China and is also aimed at overseas markets, a company news release said.\n\nHybrids, which have lagged EVs in China, are now seen as a growth opportunity. Last year, 2.6 million new hybrids were sold in China, about half the number of EVs. Together, they accounted for 36% of the market.\n\nTHE LUXURY TANK\n\nChinese EV maker BYD, known for its low-cost battery technology and cars, is also going after the high-end market in China, defined as 1 million yuan ($140,000) and up.\n\nIts Yangwang brand introduced the latest version of the U8, a monster of an off-road SUV that was launched last September and is designed for survival in rugged conditions. It comes with a satellite phone in case a driver gets stuck beyond cell phone range.\n\nThe U8 is built on a platform that enables it to turn on the spot, like a tank. It's priced at 1.1 million yuan ($150,000). For 100,000 yuan ($13,800) more, buyers can add a built-in drone system.\n\nA SIMPLER APPROACH\n\nVolvo, the Swedish brand now under Geely, offered an answer for those overwhelmed by technology.\n\n\"The current EV market is marked by a prevalent trend of excess and addition,\" said Roger Yu, Volvo's managing director for sales in greater China.\n\nHe introduced the EX30 electric SUV as a user-friendly vehicle with a sophisticated sound system and a tablet screen that are both easy to use.\n\n\"By subtracting for ease of use and adding for safety, Volvo aims to give users the clearest interface, the most user-friendly operation, and the most reassuring intelligent experience,\" he said of the in-car screen.\n\nThe company announced that the EX30 would sell in China for 210,000 to 260,000 yuan ($29,000-$36,000).\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press researcher Yu Bing and video producer Olivia Zhang contributed.\n\nKen Moritsugu, The Associated Press",

The local vendor shipped 11.7 million smartphones, thanks to its popular Mate and nova series, while OPPO rose to second place on strong performance of its Reno 11 series, shipping 10.9 million units. Conversely, HONOR, vivo, and Apple all slowed their sell-ins in the quarter, ranking third, fourth, and fifth, respectively.\n\nHONOR shipped 10.6 million units with a 16% share, a year-on-year increase of 9%, while vivo shipped 10.3 million units with a 15% share, a year-on-year decrease of 9%. Apple declined the most among the top five, sinking to fifth from first place, with 10 million units and a 15% share, which is a year-on-year decrease of 25%.\n\nHuawei's performance is up 70% from a year earlier, when the company was still reorganizing its phone business following U.S. sanctions. Huawei's 5G Mate 60 Pro uses a China-made 7-nanometer processor tailored for the local market, showcasing the kind of advanced semiconductor manufacturing capabilities that US sanctions were originally designed to prevent.\n\nHuawei has since released its new Pure line of flagship smartphones, and has been busy developing its own operating system, HarmonyOS, since it could not use Google's Android and Google Mobile Services. The continued expansion of HarmonyOS breaks the two-horse race of Android and iOS in Mainland China.\n\nThe latest data is unlikely to make for pleasant reading for Apple's CEO Tim Cook, following his trip to China for the inauguration of a major new store in Shanghai. During his visit, coming on the back of a strong Chinese fourth quarter, Cook announced the expansion of Apple's R&D center in the city, highlighting China's critical role in the company's strategy. Cook also attended the China Development Forum in Beijing, where he said the country was \"critical\" to Apple.\n\nApple is deepening its ties with China despite expanding production in Southeast Asia and India. Approximately 17% of Apple's net sales from October to December were derived from the greater China region, making it the largest regional supplier in the company's supply chain. But Apple is facing an uphill battle to reverse falling iPhone sales there, with a 24% year-on-year decline in 2023 projected to deepen through 2024.",

        "text": "BEIJING - At the end of March, Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi unveiled its first electric vehicle (EV), the SU7, igniting a spark of excitement. At the launch event, Xiaomi's founder and CEO Lei Jun, whose vision includes creating \"a dream car on a par with Porsche and Tesla,\" said that it was a product of pushing boundaries.\n\nThe market's positive response was immediate: the Xiaomi SU7 garnered almost 90,000 substantial orders within just 24 hours of its release; Xiaomi's stock jumped by 16 percent on its first trading day post-launch.\n\nBusiness Insider remarked, \"Apple abandoned its electric vehicle project. Now, one of its biggest rivals in China is showing how it's done.\"\n\nXiaomi's debut in the EV sector is expected to incentivize a new round of market competition. Price cuts across various brands after Xiaomi's launch, from the Huawei Aito M7 to the 2024 Xpeng G9, demonstrate the dynamic nature of China's EV market.\n\nBut the impact extends beyond China. Better and more affordable Chinese EVs are a boon for overseas consumers too. China's EV exports have seen a significant rise in recent years, with data showing a 77.6 percent increase to 1.2 million vehicles in 2023.\n\nOne of the reasons electric vehicles produced in China are popular worldwide is that they come in a wide variety of models with different prices, offering more choices for consumers. Moreover, they are equipped with rich software and hardware features, allowing consumers to fully experience the convenience and comfort that smart cars provide.\n\nDespite the initial success, Chinese EVs are facing considerable challenges abroad. Creating products that better cater to the preferences of overseas consumers can count as one. But, a bigger problem comes from protectionist policies imposed by the West, with an \"overcapacity\" rhetoric aiming to suppress Chinese industries.\n\nHowever, the fierce competition in China's new energy vehicle market, including price wars and fast quality upgrades, is not caused by the so-called \"overcapacity.\" In addition, the problems facing the EV industries in the United States and Europe stem from inefficiencies in corporate operations, not from Chinese \"overcapacity.\"\n\nChina's new energy products are competitive because they started early and have kept investing in its R&D, hence a leading edge in technology. Combined with the country's vast range of supporting industries, mega-size markets, and rich human resources, that leading edge becomes integrated competitiveness.\n\nIn a report earlier in April, Bloomberg found that no data is backing China's alleged \"overcapacity\" in the EV sector, saying that Chinese companies are more efficient rather than loaded with excess capacity. It added that Chinese companies aren't dumping EVs on global markets and Chinese EVs are not cheap overseas.\n\nFor instance, BYD's EV sedan Han is around 70,000 euros in the Netherlands, while the Tesla Model 3 long-range edition is sold at less than 60,000 euros.\n\nChina's green industry meets many countries' need to address the energy shortage and respond to climate change, and will contribute to the global green and low carbon transition.\n\nTake the European Union as an example. According to the European Green Deal, all new cars and vans registered in the EU will be zero-emission by 2035, de-facto banning cars and vans with internal combustion engines except e-fuel ones from registering and providing huge space for EV development in the bloc. By adopting these sustainably designed EVs, including those made in China, Europe can move faster toward a decarbonized economy.\n\nThe expansion of Chinese car manufacturers into global markets underscores a broader narrative of China's rise as a technological and industrial powerhouse. And, China's latest accomplishments in the EV sector are not a threat. The application of new EV technologies, ranging from battery efficiency to intelligent driving solutions, offers valuable insights and inspiration for European manufacturers.\n\nIncreased competition from China would help European carmakers produce better cars in the long run, said Ola Kaellenius, chairman of the board of management of Mercedes-Benz Group, in a recent interview with the Financial Times, adding that protectionism was \"going the wrong way.\" Chinese companies looking to export to Europe represent a \"natural progression of competition and need to be met with better products, better technology, more agility,\" he added.\n\nOver the last two decades, China's automotive sector has shifted from hosting foreign automakers' joint ventures to being pioneers in the EV domain. This evolution, as demonstrated by initiatives like Xiaomi's, is not merely about business expansion, but also a bold statement of China's commitment to sustainable development and its companies' dedication to delivering better products to consumers.",

        "text": "Apple could ditch vertical speakers for something a little different\n\nThere's been a lot of speculation about what the next version of Apple's HomePod may be like, and a new patent suggests we may get something different in the future. Apple Insider uncovered a patent filed by Apple, detailing a HomePod that has more of a soundbar-like design.\n\nThe patent refers to an \"Audio Speaker System\" featuring an \"ornamental design for an audio speaker system, as shown and described\". The patent itself is incredibly vague in terms of actual details, but the speaker itself is unlike any HomePod design we've seen so far.\n\nThe designs show off a horizontal speaker, akin to a chunky soundbar, rather than the existing vertical smart speaker aesthetic. The speaker is angled upwards at the front, and seems to be covered in some kind of material -- no doubt something similar to the fabric used on the HomePod and HomePod Mini.\n\nThere also seems to be a circular section in the center. While this is certainly going to be some kind of touchpad, it's possible that this may be some kind of display. We've seen display components alleging to be from a future HomePod that feature this same circular design.\n\nIt's possible that this HomePod soundbar, if it ever sees the light of day, could incorporate this. Or it may be the traditional HomePod touchpad instead. Apple Insider also spotted that the back of the speaker seems to show ports.\n\nThis could be a place to connect other devices, like an Apple TV, or potentially even hook the speaker into existing AV setups. However the diagrams aren't that detailed and it's impossible to say what ports might be included at this stage.\n\nThe biggest issue with existing HomePods is that they're completely wireless, streaming via Wi-Fi but also supporting Bluetooth and AirPlay from Apple devices. So having extra ports like this could prove to be a huge win, especially among AV enthusiasts.\n\nOf course there's no guarantee that this is a HomePod, or even that this is a product that's definitely going to be released. While it looks like a HomePod of sorts, there's also the possibility that it'll be some kind of Beats speaker -- and possibly smaller than we'd expect a HomePod to be.\n\nRumor has it that there are multiple versions of the HomePod in the works, including one with a 7-inch iPad-style display. It wouldn't be surprising if a soundbar-inspired version of the smart speaker is one of the new designs Apple has considered. Though there's no guarantee that it will release one anytime soon.\n\nBut hey, maybe a horizontal HomePod design will help mitigate the problems that caused vibrations from full-size HomePods speakers to leave ugly rings in wooden furniture. That would be something.",

        "text": "In case you didn't know, Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) is back. The granddaddy of cryptocurrencies lost more than 70% of its value between November 2021 and November 2022. However, it's nearly quadrupled since then.\n\nCould Bitcoin keep this momentum going? Ark Invest founder Cathie Wood thinks so. She expects the red-hot cryptocurrency to soar by more than 5,600%. However, not everyone agrees with her -- including one active trader on Capitol Hill.\n\nEleven investment firms won approval earlier in 2024 from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to offer spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Wood's Ark Invest was one of them. It now markets several Bitcoin-focused ETFs.\n\nThe inflow of money into these new ETFs offered by Ark Invest and others has boosted the demand for Bitcoin. Wood said at the Bitcoin Investor Day conference in March that the SEC's approval served as an \"institutional green light.\" She added that Ark Invest believes that institutional investors will allocate a little over 5% of their portfolios to Bitcoin in the future. This could push Bitcoin's price to $3.8 million, according to Ark Invest's analysis.\n\nThere's also another reason why Wood likes Bitcoin over the short term: the cryptocurrency's halving. This halving occurs every four years or so. The most recent one took place on April 19.\n\nBitcoin skyrocketed after the previous halvings in 2012, 2016, and 2020. Wood predicted at the Bitcoin Investor Conference that this year's halving should provide a big catalyst too.\n\nRep. Shri Thanedar, D-Mich., doesn't share Wood's rosy outlook about Bitcoin. The congressman recently dumped his Bitcoin stake. Thanedar didn't even wait for the halving event; he sold on Feb. 5, 2024.\n\nThe Michigan Democrat isn't only negative about Bitcoin. On the same day he sold Bitcoin, he also slashed his stakes in Ethereum and LiteCoin.\n\nHas Rep. Thanedar become a crypto bear? Maybe. But even if so, his bearish perspective isn't limited to cryptocurrencies. Thanedar has also aggressively sold several stocks in recent months, including Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft.\n\nHis selling extended beyond the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks as well. In January, Thanedar reduced his stake in Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway too.\n\nIs Bitcoin a screaming buy or a sell? I'm somewhere in the middle of the spectrum.\n\nI doubt that Wood's prediction of institutional investors parking over 5% of their portfolios in Bitcoin will happen. So far, the recent halving hasn't sparked a big rally for the cryptocurrency.\n\nOn the other hand, I don't think investors should necessarily dump their positions in Bitcoin as Rep. Thanedar did recently. For the record, I suspect his selling of all the stocks mentioned previously will prove to be shortsighted over the long term.\n\nBuffett once referred to Bitcoin as \"rat poison squared.\" The legendary investor is right that the cryptocurrency doesn't have intrinsic value in the same way that stocks do.

        "text": "William Brown, developer of webauthn-rs, has written a scathing blog post detailing how corporate interests - namely, Apple and Google - have completely and utterly destroyed the concept of passkeys. The basic gist is that Apple and Google were more interested in control and locking in users than in providing a user-friendly passwordless future, and in doing so have made passkeys effectively a worse user experience than just using passwords in a password manager.\n\nSince then Passkeys are now seen as a way to capture users and audiences into a platform. What better way to encourage long term entrapment of users then by locking all their credentials into your platform, and even better, credentials that can't be extracted or exported in any capacity.\n\nBoth Chrome and Safari will try to force you into using either hybrid (caBLE) where you scan a QR code with your phone to authenticate - you have to click through menus to use a security key. caBLE is not even a good experience, taking more than 60 seconds work in most cases. The UI is beyond obnoxious at this point. Sometimes I think the password game has a better ux.\n\nThe more egregious offender is Android, which won't even activate your security key if the website sends the set of options that are needed for Passkeys. This means the IDP gets to choose what device you enroll without your input. And of course, all the developer examples only show you the options to activate \"Google Passkeys stored in Google Password Manager\". After all, why would you want to use anything else?\n\n↫ William Brown\n\nThe whole post is a sobering read of how a dream of passwordless, and even usernameless, authentication was right within our grasp, usable by everyone, until Apple and Google got involved and enshittified the standards and tools to promote lock-in and their own interests above the user experience. If even someone as knowledgeable about this subject as Brown, who writes actual software to make these things work, is advising against using passkeys, you know something's gone horribly wrong.\n\nI also looked into possibly using passkeys, including using things like a Yubikey, but the process seems so complex and unpleasant that I, too, concluded just sticking to Bitwarden and my favourite open source TFA application was a far superior user experience.",

Our Opinion: Thirty-eight seconds of ugliness and courage in a Forsyth County classroom Debbie Storrs: As I leave, my thoughts on UNCG's path forward Turkish restaurant opens in Greensboro Embattled UNCG leader stepping aside to focus on struggle with cancer New tavern on New Garden Road serves up Southern-style bar food with its drinks Greensboro man charged with felony hit-and-run that caused serious injuries Sunday's letters: A cartoon that appeared in Saturday's newspaper crossed a line. Woman dies after crash on I-40 East ramp in Greensboro Demolition begins at old News & Record property in downtown Greensboro Another Guilford high-speed chase, another casualty. Is the risk too high? A'eo Fine Art Gallery introduces world-class works to Greensboro Crash with injuries closes both directions of I-840 in Greensboro At 216 acres, Belews Lake Park will open this summer, expected to draw thousands Morehead's Swiss Army Knife decides he will play football for Greensboro Summerfield on edge over bill that would de-annex nearly 1,000 acres in town. Legislature reconvenes today.\n\n\"But not Mexican,\" he said.\n\nImmediately, with Terminator-like efficiency, I eliminated Crafted, despite the fact that it offers Cuban, Korean and Nashville hot-chicken tacos.\n\nAs I was about to pull the trigger on one of the remaining three choices, my guest offered another refinement:\n\n\"Hey, how about some good North Carolina barbecue? Text us a place and we can all meet there.\"\n\nAnd they were gone to their hotels to freshen up.\n\nAnd this is where I'm going to offend somebody.\n\nI'm not saying you can't get good barbecue in Greensboro, because you can, but nearly every city in America has at least one place that knows how to smoke some meat. For something that will stand out, you have to drive a long way on back roads and stand in line for a long time and hope there's something left on the cutting block when you arrive.\n\nOn this day, we didn't have time to drive to Lexington or Ayden, so I texted a friend of mine who'd recently served barbecue at his daughter's wedding in High Point and asked for the name of the place.\n\nMy own daughter got married in Memphis and we catered Central BBQ and people were fighting to get the last smoked chicken wing. If you're picking a barbecue joint for one of the biggest parties you're ever going to throw, then it's got to be great, right?\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nMy friend texted that his caterer had been Black Powder Smokehouse in Jamestown and that he'd highly recommend the brisket and the gouda mac and cheese.\n\nSo like somebody who knew what he was doing, I texted my business colleagues the address, and then I drove to Jamestown, which turned out to be a shorter trip than if we'd gone to a place in the city.\n\nWe had a great meal. Black Powder Smokehouse is one of those \"when we run out, we run out\" places - which I observe as a mark of excellence - and they hadn't run out of what we wanted. I got a quarter pound of brisket, a couple of spare ribs, some gouda mac, a couple of Red Oaks and a slice of peanut butter pie, and my colleagues had versions on that same theme including a Cheerwine chicken and peach cobbler.\n\nBy the way, you've got to love a place that sells ribs by the bone instead of the rack or half-rack. The perfect side dish.\n\nAnyway, I share this example to show that we're all making restaurant choices every day and that every decision we make and group we join and meal we eat is kind of a story in and of itself.\n\nAnd every time somebody makes a decision to take the plunge and start a restaurant, it's certainly a story, and often a terrifying roller-coaster ride that includes the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.\n\nThat's why we have a full-time food editor, Michael Hastings. Last month, our most-read story on the News & Record website was about how Mike Harkenreader, a former chef for one of Greensboro's top fine-dining establishments, came to open a popular breakfast and lunch spot with his wife outside Reidsville.\n\n\"I love the values of a small community,\" Harkenreader said. \"I love the regulars. I love the small-town community feel.\"\n\nOne of our most popular stories from this past week was also a food story from Michael, about a former mortgage broker, Ziya Ozan, who recently traded in his Turkish food truck for a restaurant of the same name called Zeeyum Kitchen.\n\nOzan said he took the jump from finance to food after cooking for his neighbors during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\"They would be walking their dog by my house, and I would whistle and say, 'Hey, I have something for you to try.' And people would say, 'You should open a restaurant.'\"\n\nThese are stories that transcend the topic of food: they're about human beings overcoming obstacles to do something meaningful that makes all of us happy.\n\nWe're going to keep writing them, so let us know when you find more people and places like these with stories to tell.\n\nDimon Kendrick-Holmes is North Carolina editor for Lee Enterprises.

They outline ways to protect iOS and macOS devices from a rising threat in the community of technology professionals. Let's look into the specifics.\n\nArmed with his NSA and independent MacOS security research tenure, Wardle, a security consultant, partners with Sosonkin, whose knowledge was cultivated at Apple during his security team stint. This dynamic duo recognized a crucial gap in the market: the soaring majority of people using Apple products and the lack of specialized security solutions designed specifically for their specific ecosystem.\n\nDoubleYou is a company with an out-of-the-box thinking methodology. Rather than simply reacting to threats, they aspire to be one step ahead throughout the process through methods professional hackers often use. Imagine a security feature that scans each Mac process including suspicious remnants before it can cause harm. It is a proactive defense strategy that DoubleYou's vision is ultimately all about. Additionally, they improve the procedures for how the anomalies in DNS traffic are frequently monitored and intercepted, a key aim of malicious actors.\n\nHowever, the DoubleYou company's strategy is not just about the breakthrough technology. Sosonkin highlights their emphasis on the strategic use of currently available mechanisms, which eliminates the need for inventing a new wheel. This allows for the creation of real procedures like the blocking of unauthorized cryptocurrency mining software and anti-ransomware attacks.\n\nDespite its lofty ambitions, DoubleYou remains grounded in its immediate objective: providing a firewall against malware. Sosonkin sums it up succinctly: \"Our motto is: \"We just want to catch some malware.\" Such commitment to user safety and their native familiarization with Apple's security field makes DoubleYou a reputable competitor in cybersecurity.",

If those gains hold until the opening bell, its valuation will top $2 trillion for the first time.\n\nThe stock climbed higher after Alphabet posted earnings for the three months to March 31 after Thursday's close with profits and revenue that both smashed analysts' forecasts.\n\nThe announcement that it would follow the lead of rivals including Microsoft, Apple, and Meta by issuing its first dividend also served as a green light for the market.\n\n\"Alphabet joining the ranks of tech companies paying dividends is a sign of the times,\" AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said. \"Big tech firms have enjoyed stellar growth over the past decade and while most remain highly innovative, their cash flows have become so strong that there's oodles of money left over post-reinvestment in the business to reward shareholders.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Microsoft stock made more modest gains after it reported first-quarter earnings on Thursday afternoon.\n\nShares were up almost in pre-market trading, putting its market capitalization on course to jump about $11 billion at the opening bell back above $3 trillion. It first hit that milestone back in January following a 207% surge over the past five years.\n\nMicrosoft said it plans to ramp up spending on artificial intelligence and cloud services to take advantage of the AI boom.\n\nCFO Amy Hood said on a post-earnings call with analysts that spending would increase \"materially,\" adding that the company's AI capacity hadn't kept pace with soaring demand.\n\nMicrosoft has emerged as one of the major winners from the AI boom due to its close relationship with OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT.\n\n\"The path to AI monetization is clearest for Microsoft,\" Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said.\n\n\"Its substantial AI investments have driven gains in its formidable cloud business, and its other products are also easily kitted out with AI additions.

        "text": "Trading in your old Apple device is a good way to score a discount on the latest iPhones and Macs, and it's usually a pretty seamless process if you go direct to Apple. But people who have done exactly that have been getting weird messages from Apple saying that their trade in has been canceled, often many months after they've actually gotten rid of their old tech.\n\nOver the last couple of days, numerous posts have appeared online from people who have previously traded in Apple devices. According to AppleInsider, people have been receiving an official email from Apple claiming that \"because we didn't receive your device within the required time frame, your trade in has been canceled. If you've already sent your device to our trade-in partner, it will be shipped back to you.\"\n\nReceiving a message like this might not be unusual in and of itself, as Apple can cancel a trade in if the device has not been received within 14 days. But in most of the recent cases, devices were sent in months ago, with the trade-in process already being successfully completed.\n\nAs it turns out, the messages were sent in error. AppleInsider says that \"Apple has confirmed that this is some kind of system error, and no action by the consumer is necessary.\" If you've received one of these messages, then, there's no need to worry.\n\nApple is not known for giving particularly generous valuations of old tech that you want to trade in (although it does occasionally raise its prices), so it's often a good idea to look at third-party recyclers, as they might offer you a better price.\n\nHowever, the main attraction of going to Apple is convenience, as you can trade in your old device and get a discount towards a new one in a single transaction. If you go elsewhere, you must sell your device to one company, then go to Apple and pay full price for your new product, which can be a hassle.\n\nErrors like the ones seen recently are quite unusual, and the fact that they have happened to so many people is a strong indication that there was some sort of problem in Apple's backend system.\n\nWith Apple aware of the issue, we doubt it will continue for long. That means trading in your old device at Apple is still a decent idea, especially if you want to get some money off a new iPhone.

So my expensive iMac is bricked because the mouse has lies upside down with cable plugged into its belly.\n\nBut hey, I can appreciate the nice aesthetic while I sit and watch it charging.

        "text": "Biometric authentication has transformed mobile security, and Apple's Face ID, introduced with the iPhone X in 2017, stands at the forefront of this revolution.\n\nUtilizing advanced facial recognition technology, Face ID goes beyond traditional methods by leveraging depth-sensing cameras and machine learning algorithms.\n\nStored securely within the device's Secure Enclave, Face ID creates a mathematical representation of facial features, ensuring unparalleled security. Moreover, its seamless integration into iOS apps has redefined user interactions, setting new standards for mobile authentication.\n\nIn this blog, we'll delve into the process of integrating Face ID into iOS apps to enhance both security and user experience.\n\nFace ID replaces the conventional Touch ID with a sophisticated facial recognition system, providing users with a secure and effortless means of unlocking their devices and validating actions.\n\nUtilizing the TrueDepth camera system, Face ID captures and analyzes facial features in real-time, generating a precise 3D map.\n\nThis map, created from thousands of infrared dots projected onto the face, forms a unique Faceprint and is securely stored within the device's Secure Enclave.\n\nDuring authentication, Face ID compares the current facial data with the stored Faceprint, utilizing machine learning to adapt to changes in appearance and ensure consistent performance.\n\nIn essence, Face ID represents a user-friendly authentication solution that integrates cutting-edge technology to redefine mobile security and user experience standards on iOS devices.\n\nFace ID presents a significant leap forward in security and convenience compared to traditional password or PIN-based authentication methods.\n\nBy relying on facial recognition technology, it eliminates the need for manual input, offering users a seamless and hands-free authentication experience.\n\nFurthermore, the inherent uniqueness of facial features makes Face ID exceptionally secure, greatly reducing the risk of phishing attacks.\n\nMisconceptions surrounding Face ID's security and privacy have led to concerns about data storage and privacy risks.\n\nHowever, it's crucial to understand that Face ID securely stores facial data locally on the device, making it inaccessible to apps or cloud services.\n\nAdditionally, it continually improves its performance through machine learning algorithms, enhancing security measures while safeguarding user privacy.\n\nSince Face ID operates solely on the device, it doesn't transmit facial data externally, mitigating privacy concerns and ensuring user data remains protected.\n\nTo successfully integrate Face ID into iOS apps, developers need to meet specific hardware, software, and prerequisite criteria.\n\nEnsure the device includes a TrueDepth camera system (a key component for Face ID functionality) available on iPhone X and later models.\n\nFace ID integration requires a minimum iOS version compatible with the TrueDepth camera, typically iOS 11 or later.\n\n1. Privacy Considerations: Developers should dhere to Apple's privacy guidelines and obtain user consent when accessing biometric data for authentication.\n\n2. App Capabilities: Ensure that the app's file includes the necessary permissions and descriptions for accessing FaceID usage description. This is crucial for informing users about why the app requires Face ID access.\n\nTo access the faceID into an iOS app involves several key steps:\n\nUpdate Info.plist: Add 'Privacy  --  Face ID Usage Description' to the app's Info.plist file. This string value informs users about the app's use of Face ID and should be concise yet informative.\n\nCreate Authenticator: Create an authenticator within the app that uses Face ID APIs to authenticate users. Import the 'LocalAuthentication' module, which provides access to authentication-related APIs.\n\nHere we need to check whether the device supports biometric authentication or not, to do that we have created an extension of LAContext which provides the status of availability.\n\nThis extension introduces an enum , enabling developers to determine the supported biometric authentication method on iOS devices.\n\nIt checks for the device supports for the biometric authentication using . If biometric authentication is not available, it returns .\n\nFor devices running iOS 11.0 and later, it utilizes the property of to determine the supported biometric type.\n\nAdditionally, it includes a case for potential future biometric methods, such as optic scanning, and provides a fallback mechanism for devices running iOS versions older than 11.0.\n\nFor authentication, we have created an Authenticator class which manages all the authentication-related things.\n\nIn this class, we have the authenticate() method to authenticate whether the user is verified or not and it will act accordingly.\n\nThis function is responsible for initiating the biometric authentication process.\n\nThis function provides a structured approach to biometric authentication, handling success, failure, and error scenarios gracefully while ensuring a smooth user experience.\n\nThis Swift function is responsible for setting a passcode using biometric authentication, if available.\n\nHere's a breakdown of its functionality:\n\nThe encrypted passcode is stored with a key and the encryption key is stored with a key , This ensures that the passcode remains stored on the device.\n\nIf you are not aware about AES encryption then here is the good Article on it which explains AES encryption in detail.\n\nThis post only has Authentication implementation steps, to read the complete guide including Handling Fallback and Testing & Debugging implementation please visit this blog.\n\nThe post is originally published on canopas.com.\n\nIf you like what you read, be sure to hit\n\n💖 button below! -- as a writer it means the world!\n\nI encourage you to share your thoughts in the comments section below.

        "text": "You're reading this week's edition of the New Cannabis Ventures weekly newsletter, which we have been publishing since October 2015. The newsletter includes unique insight to help our readers stay ahead of the curve as well as links to the week's most important news. We post this and all of the newsletters on our website here.\n\nFriends,\n\nThis has been a tough week for the largest MSOs, all of which have declined by more than 2.5%:\n\nThere was no news, and stocks in general have had a tough week. One piece of news that did not take place may be weighing on these stocks: 4/20 passed without any word from the DEA on rescheduling. It has been almost 8 months now since the potential rescheduling news hit in late August.\n\nThere are still a few days left this month, but April has been challenging for cannabis stocks. The five largest public MSOs have all declined by 5.8% or more. The New Cannabis Ventures American Cannabis Operator Index, which includes 13 MSOs, has dropped 10.4%. The index is still up a lot year-to-date at +20.9%. More broadly, the NCV Global Cannabis Stock Index has pulled back 7.4% so far in April and is up 16.6% so far in 2024.\n\nRescheduling remains the largest potential driver of cannabis stocks. Again, if the DEA follows the recommendation of the Department of Health & Human Services to move cannabis from Schedule 1 to Schedule 3, then the 280E tax will end. This will boost operating cash flow and net income for the cannabis producers and should help the entire industry. Still, we don't know when this could happen, and the DEA could move to Schedule 2, which would not end the tax.\n\nAdvisorShares Pure US Cannabis ETF (NYSE Arca: MSOS), which has no official index, has rallied less than the American Cannabis Operator Index so far this year, gaining 20.1%. The ETF remains highly concentrated, with its holdings of the largest 5 MSOs at 82.7%. The shares outstanding have not changed this week so far. This is the first week since December 22nd when they haven't increased. The ETF's shares outstanding have increased by 33.6% so far this year and 78.2% since August 25th, reflecting investor optimism regarding rescheduling.\n\nMSOS has rallied a lot since late August too, gaining 74.6% from its all-time closing low of $4.82 on 8/28:\n\nIt looks like a double-top in price has been set near $10.50, and the ETF appears to be rolling over. It ended 2023 at $7.01, which is 16.7% lower. If 280E remains, it will possibly post an all-time low, as the largest MSOs all have debt and a lack of cash flow to pay it off. Investors should be aware of how much trading volume there is in this ETF and how concentrated its ownership is.\n\nEarnings season begins in just a few days, and the largest MSOs are scheduled to report on May 8th and May 9th. We will publish previews before the month ends. We reported that Q4 financial reports were not exciting, and we don't expect Q1 reports will be either. Unfortunately, it's all about potential rescheduling and potential adult-use legalization in Florida for now.\n\nNew Cannabis Ventures publishes curated articles as well as exclusive news. Here is some of the most important content from this week:\n\nCuraleaf Closes Canadian LP Acquisition for Initial $16 Million in Stock\n\nTo get real-time updates download our free mobile app for Android or Apple devices, like our Facebook page, or follow Alan on Twitter.

        "text": "BEIJING (AP) -- China's vision of the future of the automobile -- electrified and digitally connected -- is on display at the ongoing Beijing auto show.\n\nOrganizers say that 117 new models are making their debut at Auto China 2024, which runs through May 4. They range from eye-poppingly cutting edge to more subtle novelties.\n\nTHE CONNECTED CAR\n\nOne of the biggest mob scenes was for the opening day presentation by Xiaomi, a major Chinese maker of smartphones and trendy, affordable smart appliances aimed at younger generations that's entering the car market for the first time.\n\nXiaomi announced that it had received more than 75,000 orders in the four weeks since the launch of its first car, the SU7, with a list price of 215,900 to 299,900 yuan ($29,800-$41,400).\n\nWhy is a phone company making a car? Analysts say connectivity. Consumer technology companies want to connect the lives of their customers across all their devices -- phones, laptops, televisions and now cars.\n\n\"It starts with the concept of the third place,\" said Beatrix Keim, the China director at German auto research center CAR. \"Because nowadays people are at the office, at home and then mainly they're spending the time in the car.\"\n\nThe approach works well in China, a highly digital society where e-payments are the norm and the convenience of connectivity trumps privacy concerns for most.\n\nChinese telecom giant Huawei has ventured into the car business too. Apple explored the idea but dropped it earlier this year.\n\nTHE CAR AS LIVING SPACE\n\nSome Chinese makers are taking the idea of a third space to new heights.\n\nZeekr unveiled the Mix, an electric vehicle with an interior that can transform into a small room while parked. The front seats swivel to face the back ones, with a table in between that a company executive told the crowd could be used to play card games or enjoy a Chinese hot-pot meal.\n\nStefan Sielaff, the design director of Zeekr, described the Mix as \"a nice experiment\" focusing on younger families.\n\n\"I wouldn't even call it a car or an MPV or a van,\" he said. \"It's more a lifestyle capsule. It's an iPod on wheels.\"\n\nIt will be the fifth model for Zeekr, a 2 1/2-year-old premium EV brand of China's Geely group, a major maker that owns Volvo and has designers in Sweden and Shanghai.\n\nThe Mix will go on sale in China by the end of June, the company said. Its selling price has not been announced.\n\nTHE HYBRID APPROACHFeatured Local Savings\n\nAn EV boom in China that started three years ago has eaten into the market for gasoline-powered cars, but they are not dead yet.\n\nSo says Chery Automobile Co., China's biggest exporter, which told its auto show audience that it would continue to develop gasoline cars as well as EVs and hybrids.\n\nIts EXEED Yaoguang C-DM, a hybrid SUV launched last month, was one of four vehicles it highlighted -- two hybrids and two EVs.\n\nThe Yaoguang SUV sells for 159,800 to 225,800 yuan ($22,000-$31,000) in China and is also aimed at overseas markets, a company news release said.\n\nHybrids, which have lagged EVs in China, are now seen as a growth opportunity. Last year, 2.6 million new hybrids were sold in China, about half the number of EVs. Together, they accounted for 36% of the market.\n\nTHE LUXURY TANK\n\nChinese EV maker BYD, known for its low-cost battery technology and cars, is also going after the high-end market in China, defined as 1 million yuan ($140,000) and up.\n\nIts Yangwang brand introduced the latest version of the U8, a monster of an off-road SUV that was launched last September and is designed for survival in rugged conditions. It comes with a satellite phone in case a driver gets stuck beyond cell phone range.\n\nThe U8 is built on a platform that enables it to turn on the spot, like a tank. It's priced at 1.1 million yuan ($150,000). For 100,000 yuan ($13,800) more, buyers can add a built-in drone system.\n\nA SIMPLER APPROACH\n\nVolvo, the Swedish brand now under Geely, offered an answer for those overwhelmed by technology.\n\n\"The current EV market is marked by a prevalent trend of excess and addition,\" said Roger Yu, Volvo's managing director for sales in greater China.\n\nHe introduced the EX30 electric SUV as a user-friendly vehicle with a sophisticated sound system and a tablet screen that are both easy to use.\n\n\"By subtracting for ease of use and adding for safety, Volvo aims to give users the clearest interface, the most user-friendly operation, and the most reassuring intelligent experience,\" he said of the in-car screen.\n\nThe company announced that the EX30 would sell in China for 210,000 to 260,000 yuan ($29,000-$36,000).\n\nAssociated Press researcher Yu Bing and video producer Olivia Zhang contributed.",

        "text": "A Harris County District Court judge denied rapper Travis Scott's bid to be removed from the upcoming civil trial over the deaths and injuries that occurred at the 2021 Astroworld festival.\n\nJudge Kristen Hawkins issued a series of orders Wednesday keeping the festival's headliner as a defendant in the lawsuit, while also removing other defendants that had sought summary judgment.\n\n[...]\n\nHawkins also ordered that ASM Global and its related companies, who manage NRG Park, remain as a defendant. The judge also rejected a second attempt by Apple Inc., to be removed from the litigation.\n\nSeyth Boardman, the festival's safety and risk director, was also denied summary judgment.\n\nHawkins granted summary judgement for Tri Star Sports & Entertainment Group and Unified Command LLC, removing them from litigation.\n\nIn a hearing last week, Scott and other parties in the sprawling lawsuit argued they should be dismissed because the suing victims had failed to show evidence showing them potentially responsible for the tragedy, or had failed on other matters of law.\n\nIt was the second such hearing held in Hawkins' court. Earlier in the month, she issued another series of orders removing other defendants from the lawsuit, including the rapper Drake, who performed with Scott at the end of the concert.\n\nThe defendants who remain will likely now play a part in the first jury trial to occur over a death connected to the festival.\n\nSee here, here, here, and here for the background. The trial itself begins on May 6. It's important to remember that this is just the first of the lawsuits filed over the Astroworld tragedy to be litigated. There are others, with many other plaintiffs, that will surely be affected by the outcome here. I'll be keeping an eye on it.",

Now the company has slashed that forecast by nearly 50%. Kuo says that Apple now expects to sell between 400,000 and 450,000 Vision Pro units this year. And that includes sales from the international rollout, which may begin as soon as June.\n\nWhy is the Vision Pro faring so badly? As I previously addressed, the Vision Pro has three problems. First, at $3,500 it's way too expensive for the average consumer. Second, it doesn't really do anything that much better than what our other devices already do. I can browse the web from my computer just fine and watch movies on my large-screen TV, too, without a Vision Pro. Third, while the spatial computing interface definitely has a \"wow\" factor, there's no killer app that is so ground-breakingly useful or addictive that people seem willing to go out and spend $3,500 on a device just to run it.\n\nIt's because of these three things, I believe, that Vision Pro sales are tanking. And not it's just sales. A quick look at Google Trends data suggests that even general interest about the device has fallen off a cliff and never recovered. Look at the Google Trends data below.trends.embed.renderExploreWidget(\"TIMESERIES\", {\"comparisonItem\":[{\"keyword\":\"/g/11kq0l74bn\",\"geo\":\"US\",\"time\":\"2024-01-01 2024-04-24''}],\"category\":0,\"property\":\"\"}, {\"exploreQuery\":\"date=2024-01-01%202024-04-24&geo=US&q=%2Fg%2F11kq0l74bn&hl=en\",\"guestPath\":\"https://trends.google.com:443/trends/embed/\"});\n\nYou see that massive spike from February 1 to February 4? That was 24 hours before the launch of the Vision Pro followed by the first 72 hours it went on sale. But look what happened in March -- internet search interest was down below mid-January levels. And since April it has stayed there.",

Launched in 2006, the sandbox game has no goals; just hand over $9.99 to Steam, jump in, and do whatever you like.\n\nWith the benefit of hindsight, some fans may have taken that a little too literally. At the time of writing, Garry's Mod workshop content uploaded by users over many years, is being systematically taken down in response to takedown notices filed by Nintendo.\n\n\"This is an ongoing process, as we have 20 years of uploads to go through. If you want to help us by deleting your Nintendo related uploads and never uploading them again, that would help us a lot,\" the Facepunch Studios announcement reads.\n\nThe team don't seem especially upset and are taking everything in their stride. Nintendo has a reputation for taking action against content featuring its characters and artwork so removing it now is the right thing to do.\n\n\"Honestly, this is fair enough. This is Nintendo's content and what they allow and don't allow is up to them. They don't want you playing with that stuff in Garry's Mod - that's their decision, we have to respect that and take down as much as we can,\" the announcement adds.\n\nNormal service will be restored shortly, but some fans may still need convincing regarding recent events. They believe that some type of scammer, probably not even connected to Nintendo, has been using bogus notices to take content down for quite some time.\n\nMindful that Garry and the team needed to be aware of that, so that nothing gets taken offline unnecessarily, attracting their attention became a priority this week.\n\nAs the image from X shows, a few hours after being alerted, investigations ended with the conclusion that the takedowns were legitimate. Yet for some, that still wasn't good enough. Over the past few months there have been reports of bogus DMCA notices claiming to have been sent by Nintendo, containing allegedly similar fictitious claims. Many were resurrected this week after more than three years, contributing to the chaos.\n\nIn some cases, users simply expressed sadness or sympathy for Garry and the team. In many, many others, passions and frustrations proved too much. Instead of the usual blanket bitterness towards Nintendo, Garry's X account filled up with demands for evidence, rock-solid proof that Nintendo really was to blame. Some even fired off accusations that no work had been done to get to the bottom of the crisis.\n\nIn a post to X, Garry addressed the \"it's fake\" guys by posing five questions, all of them related to a domain name referenced in one or more of the takedown notices. The skeptics believe that the domain mm-nintendo.com is fake; Nintendo 'always' use a different domain, and domain details here are different to those used elsewhere, etc.\n\nWe've seen more than our fair share of bogus notices in the past but since these notices don't appear to have been shared in public, determining whether they're real or fake simply isn't possible.\n\nSince Garry is on record saying that they're real, there's no obvious reason to question that. It shouldn't come as a big surprise that developers can become quite attached to their projects and the communities that support them; removing content for no reason isn't something they do lightly. So whether real or fake, voluntarily or under duress, a decision has clearly been made to say goodbye to content that, in real terms, amounts to a liability.\n\nThat being said, let's squeeze the domain mm-nintendo.com and see what comes out.\n\nFinding takedown notices featuring the domain mm-nintendo.com wasn't difficult. The pair shown below seem fairly typical; they both use notice@ in their email addresses and were sent to ISPs asking for content to be taken down.\n\nA similar notice sent to GitHub in 2020 took content down using the DMCA. In other parts of the notice, takedowns were requested under trademark law.\n\nAt this point, it's worth highlighting something that all of these notices have in common: not a single one targets pirated copies of Nintendo games. Instead, they all target audiovisual works, images, and fictional character depictions, to which Nintendo owns the rights. It's a trend that runs through all similar notices.\n\nA 2019 takedown notice sent to itch.io, also featuring the email address [email protected], displays the same features as another sent to Sankakucomplex in 2019. No games piracy in sight, only alleged infringement in characters, artwork, and audiovisual works.\n\nIt doesn't seem unreasonable to raise a theory at this point; is it possible that Nintendo uses the mm-nintendo.com domain when takedown notices target characters, artwork, and audiovisual works, in cases where specific expertise is necessary?\n\nThere's no direct evidence to show that the MM in mm-nintendo.com stands for MarkMonitor. However, there's plenty of evidence to show MarkMonitor has connections to Nintendo. The domain was registered through MarkMonitor in September 2016 and then updated somewhat coincidentally this Wednesday when the Garry's Mod controversy began.\n\nThe most obvious change is the prominence of the email address [email protected] before the update. MarkMonitor doesn't manage all 6,431 domain names currently listed under Nintendo of America, but it has provided brand protection services for some of the biggest names in business.\n\nWhen Apple worked with MarkMonitor back in 2013, records show the company operated the domain mm-apple.com. While that domain has long since expired, mm-microsoft.com is very much alive and just like mm-nintendo.com, redirects to its owner's main domain.\n\nOther domains registered through MarkMonitor and used for brand protection over the years, probably behaved in much the same way; mm-velcro.com, mm-walmart.com, mm-loreal.com, and mm-nissan.com, for example.\n\nThere seems no doubt that the domain mm-nintendo.com a) actually exists b) is used for brand protection purposes and c) isn't used often or even at all for regular DMCA takedown work. That leads to the final item, d) the domain is different because it has a specific purpose.\n\nIt's possible that brand protection matters are handled by a dedicated Nintendo department and/or MarkMonitor itself, which also has an office in the UK. Perhaps the image below, uploaded on Thursday, offers a few more clues. Just don't venture too close to the edge.\n\nWhether the DMCA or similar takedown notices sent to Garry and the team are legitimate is best judged by those who have seen them. Based on the above, however, his claim - that the notices are official - should really be the last word on the matter.\n\nAs for the other 'fake' notices previously sent that also mention the mm-nintendo.com domain, only a close review of each could determine whether they're genuine and/or accurate. When everything is said and done, however, perhaps the most important question is whether they target obviously Nintendo-like characters or imagery.",

        "text": "The strategy for our Multi Cap Equity Fund is founded on the notion that investing in businesses of all sizes provides investors with the broadest possible opportunity set and may provide a measure of insulation as market leadership shifts (sometimes dramatically) from one size category to another.\n\nThe Multi Cap Equity Fund's Institutional Class returned +8.98% for the first quarter compared to +10.02% for the Russell 3000 Index. For the one-year period ended March 31, 2024, the Fund's Institutional Class returned +26.04% compared to +29.29% for the index.\n\nEquities continued to rally in the first quarter, generating very strong absolute returns for Fund shareholders and pushing many market indices to all-time highs. The Fund's absolute results for the year were similarly strong. We are pleased to report strong, risk-adjusted absolute returns for both the quarter and the year, despite modestly lagging the index.\n\nThe strategy for our Multi Cap Equity Fund is founded on the notion that investing in businesses of all sizes provides investors with the broadest possible opportunity set and may provide a measure of insulation as market leadership shifts (sometimes dramatically) from one size category to another. In recent years, however, large- and mega-cap companies have rarely relinquished the crown, and the first quarter and 12-month period were no exception. Befitting our strategy, we own several positions in this space, including two of the market's Magnificent Seven (Alphabet, Inc. (GOOG) and Meta Platforms, Inc. (META)) and indirectly a third, (Apple, Inc. (AAPL), via Berkshire Hathaway, Inc.'s (BRK.B) sizeable position), and our performance benefited accordingly.\n\nOur small and medium-sized businesses also performed well, and the Fund outperformed the small-cap and mid-cap indices, even as we lagged the capitalization-weighted Russell 3000, which is dominated by the same mega-cap stocks that have fueled the large-cap Russell 1000 index. Of course, while we aspire for long-term outperformance in any environment, periods of small- and/or mid-cap outperformance could provide a relative performance tailwind for our portfolio compared to the \"top-heavy\" Russell 3000.\n\nMeta Platforms and Berkshire Hathaway were mega-cap winners and top contributors in the first quarter, although small-cap Perimeter Solutions SA's (PRM) 61% gain made it the Fund's strongest performing stock on an absolute basis. Perimeter's sole material competitor for wildfire retardants was forced to withdraw their product due to corrosive damage to the airtankers used to deploy it. Aggregates purveyors Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (MLM) and Vulcan Materials Co. (VMC) round out the top quarterly contributors list thanks to continued heathy price increases and strong demand from public infrastructure projects.\n\nLiberty Broadband Corp. (LBRDA) (a holding company that owns 32% of broadband provider Charter Communications, Inc. (CHTR)) was the Fund's primary detractor. Charter has been a multi-quarter laggard, as increased competition from wireless broadband alternatives has dampened broadband subscriber growth, while elevated network upgrade and expansion plans have depressed current cash flows in favor of future returns. Adding to these woes, management disclosed that roughly five million of its broadband customers receive a federal subsidy that will expire in April. We anticipate that Charter will retain many, if not most, of these subscribers and that the financial impact will be manageable. This development further clouds near-term results, but we believe our long-term investment thesis remains intact. We added to our exposure by initiating a position directly in Charter shares, and we will shape our exposure in conjunction with holdings of Liberty Broadband. Negative returns from LICT Corp. (OTCPK:LICT), Liberty Global, Ltd. (LBTYK), Laboratory Corp. Holdings of America (LH), and Liberty Latin America Ltd. (LILA) (LILAK) rounded out the top detractors list.\n\nPerformance was broadly strong across the portfolio for the past year, with top performers Meta Platforms, Alphabet, Martin Marietta Materials, Berkshire Hathaway, and CoStar Group, Inc. (CSGP) each contributing over 2% to the Fund's overall return. On the other hand, Liberty Broadband's dismal first quarter performance made it the Fund's top detractor for the quarter and the year. Fellow detractor Liberty Global has announced plans to separately list its Swiss business and is examining other steps to unlock the latent value in its assets. After a multi-year period of disappointing results, we opted to sell our remaining shares in Liberty Latin America. LICT Corp and LKQ Corp. (LKQ) were modest detractors for the year.\n\nDuring the first quarter, we made valuation-related trims to Berkshire Hathaway, Gartner, Inc. (IT), Martin Marietta Materials, and Vulcan Materials. We also exited our investment in Markel Group, Inc. (MKL) at a reasonable profit. As previously mentioned, we initiated a new position in Charter shares to add to our exposure directly, rather than via additional Liberty Broadband shares. At current prices, we believe shares are attractive without the \"double discount\" at Liberty Broadband (a discount applied from investors due to the structural complexity of the security on top of Charter itself trading at a discount to our estimate of intrinsic value) and without the additional complexities.\n\nWe also initiated a new position in VeriSign, Inc. (VRSN), operator of critical internet infrastructure known as the Domain Name System (DNS). DNS enables the translation of easily recognizable/memorable website names into their assigned numeric Internet Protocol (IP) address. This IP address contains the information necessary to route a connection from the source computer to the requested data or service. VeriSign oversees the DNS for all \".com\" and \".net\" websites under its contract with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) - the global nonprofit that oversees domain names and IP addresses globally - and has done so with no service interruptions since 1991. Under the terms of the contract, VeriSign earns a modest annual fee from the owner of each address in its digital \"address\" book, enjoys contractually agreed-upon price escalators, and maintains a presumptive right of renewal into the future. Given the evergreen nature of its contract and the mission-critical nature of its offerings, we believe VeriSign has a very wide moat (competitive advantage) around its business, and we were pleased to acquire shares at a discount to our estimate of value.\n\nTo reiterate, we believe that investing in businesses of all sizes, using our Quality at a Discount framework, is an enduring advantage of a multi-cap investing strategy. Valuation remains our North Star, and while price appreciation may have outstripped business value growth of late, we think our stocks are priced at reasonable attractive discounts to business value and are capable of earning reasonable, risk-adjusted returns.\n\nData is for the quarter ending 03/31/2024.

They range from eye-poppingly cutting edge to more subtle novelties.\n\nTHE CONNECTED CAR\n\nOne of the biggest mob scenes was for the opening day presentation by Xiaomi, a major Chinese maker of smartphones and trendy, affordable smart appliances aimed at younger generations that's entering the car market for the first time.\n\nXiaomi announced that it had received more than 75,000 orders in the four weeks since the launch of its first car, the SU7, with a list price of 215,900 to 299,900 yuan ($29,800-$41,400).\n\nWhy is a phone company making a car? Analysts say connectivity. Consumer technology companies want to connect the lives of their customers across all their devices -- phones, laptops, televisions and now cars.\n\n\"It starts with the concept of the third place,\" said Beatrix Keim, the China director at German auto research center CAR. \"Because nowadays people are at the office, at home and then mainly they're spending the time in the car.\"\n\nThe approach works well in China, a highly digital society where e-payments are the norm and the convenience of connectivity trumps privacy concerns for most.\n\nChinese telecom giant Huawei has ventured into the car business too. Apple explored the idea but dropped it earlier this year.\n\nTHE CAR AS LIVING SPACE\n\nSome Chinese makers are taking the idea of a third space to new heights.\n\nZeekr unveiled the Mix, an electric vehicle with an interior that can transform into a small room while parked. The front seats swivel to face the back ones, with a table in between that a company executive told the crowd could be used to play card games or enjoy a Chinese hot-pot meal.\n\nStefan Sielaff, the design director of Zeekr, described the Mix as \"a nice experiment\" focusing on younger families.\n\n\"I wouldn't even call it a car or an MPV or a van,\" he said. \"It's more a lifestyle capsule. It's an iPod on wheels.\"\n\nIt will be the fifth model for Zeekr, a 2 1/2-year-old premium EV brand of China's Geely group, a major maker that owns Volvo and has designers in Sweden and Shanghai.\n\nThe Mix will go on sale in China by the end of June, the company said. Its selling price has not been announced.\n\nTHE HYBRID APPROACH\n\nAn EV boom in China that started three years ago has eaten into the market for gasoline-powered cars, but they are not dead yet.\n\nSo says Chery Automobile Co., China's biggest exporter, which told its auto show audience that it would continue to develop gasoline cars as well as EVs and hybrids.\n\nIts EXEED Yaoguang C-DM, a hybrid SUV launched last month, was one of four vehicles it highlighted -- two hybrids and two EVs.\n\nThe Yaoguang SUV sells for 159,800 to 225,800 yuan ($22,000-$31,000) in China and is also aimed at overseas markets, a company news release said.\n\nHybrids, which have lagged EVs in China, are now seen as a growth opportunity. Last year, 2.6 million new hybrids were sold in China, about half the number of EVs. Together, they accounted for 36% of the market.\n\nTHE LUXURY TANK\n\nChinese EV maker BYD, known for its low-cost battery technology and cars, is also going after the high-end market in China, defined as 1 million yuan ($140,000) and up.\n\nIts Yangwang brand introduced the latest version of the U8, a monster of an off-road SUV that was launched last September and is designed for survival in rugged conditions. It comes with a satellite phone in case a driver gets stuck beyond cell phone range.\n\nThe U8 is built on a platform that enables it to turn on the spot, like a tank. It's priced at 1.1 million yuan ($150,000). For 100,000 yuan ($13,800) more, buyers can add a built-in drone system.\n\nA SIMPLER APPROACH\n\nVolvo, the Swedish brand now under Geely, offered an answer for those overwhelmed by technology.\n\n\"The current EV market is marked by a prevalent trend of excess and addition,\" said Roger Yu, Volvo's managing director for sales in greater China.\n\nHe introduced the EX30 electric SUV as a user-friendly vehicle with a sophisticated sound system and a tablet screen that are both easy to use.\n\n\"By subtracting for ease of use and adding for safety, Volvo aims to give users the clearest interface, the most user-friendly operation, and the most reassuring intelligent experience,\" he said of the in-car screen.\n\nThe company announced that the EX30 would sell in China for 210,000 to 260,000 yuan ($29,000-$36,000).\n\nAssociated Press researcher Yu Bing and video producer Olivia Zhang contributed.",

        "text": "(Reuters) -Google and Microsoft rallied on Friday as the technology bellwethers showed that hefty investments into artificial intelligence could reap more immediate revenue returns, a sharp contrast to Meta Platforms' view that AI is a long-term bet.\n\nMicrosoft's shares advanced 3.84% in trading before the U.S. market opened after the company beat Wall Street estimates for third-quarter revenue and profit, driven by gains from the adoption of AI across its cloud services.\n\nGoogle-parent Alphabet soared an even-steeper 11.5%, poised to top $2 trillion in market value, after not only beating quarterly estimates, but also rewarding investors with its first-ever dividend and a $70 billion stock buyback plan.\n\nThat sparked a 1% to 3% rise in the shares of other big tech companies, including Amazon.com, Apple, Nvidia and even Meta Platforms, whose stock price tumbled over 10% on Thursday as the social media firm signalled its costly AI bets could take years to pay off.\n\nThe tech titans have been locked in a fierce battle in the race for generative AI, which can create text, videos and photos from prompts and is seen as the next frontier in tech. Analysts though are divided over whether Alphabet or Microsoft wears the AI crown.\n\n\"Microsoft continues to put together masterpiece after masterpiece as this quarter represents its dominant position in the AI Revolution,\" Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said.\n\nBut Scott Devitt, Ives' colleague at Wedbush said, \"We think the results further validate Google's position as a leading AI beneficiary.\"\n\nMicrosoft has access to OpenAI's coveted AI technologies, which it has been working to infuse across its product portfolio, such as in Bing, Microsoft 365 and, most importantly, the Azure cloud-computing platform.\n\n\"AI services contributed seven points of growth\" to the 31% jump in revenue from Azure, Microsoft finance chief Amy Hood said.\n\nWhile Goldman Sachs said Microsoft is well positioned to replicate the success of its Azure build-out playbook in its AI-laced suite, Oppenheimer predicted the company's AI dominance would be reminiscent of a couple of decades back.\n\n\"We see it revisiting its PC-era-type dominance, but of a 1000x larger market as it is the dominant AI platform for enterprises,\" analyst Timothy Horan said.\n\nOn the other hand, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai touted Google's AI offerings as a boon to its market-leading service -- core search results.\n\n\"Google's Q1 ranked somewhere north of outstanding ... and management appears in better control of its own AI narrative,\" said RBC analyst Khadijah Gibson.\n\n\"Aside from a similarly-sized capex guide up as Meta, Google is more than weathering the GenAI concerns.\"\n\nIf premarket gains hold, Alphabet, Wall Street's fourth-most valuable company, will cross $2 trillion in market value on an intraday basis -- a milestone it last hit, but failed to hold on to, three years ago, according to LSEG Datastream.\n\nThree of the so-called 'Big Six' have reported quarterly results so far. Of the remaining, Amazon, now the only one that does not pay a dividend, is due to report results next week.\n\n(Reporting by Gokul Pisharody and Siddarth S in Bengaluru and Samuel Indyk in London; Editing by Amanda Cooper and Savio D'Souza)",

I would have kicked me out too,\" jested Vogue in a recent chat with the Daily Mail.\n\nExplaining that her parents were divorced at the time, Vogue went to live with her father after her mum had had enough of her behaviour. She explained: \"I think that came when I went to a festival I wasn't supposed to go to. Mum was like 'right, that's enough, you can go and live with your dad.' I went to stay with him for a bit, and he let me get away with murder.\"\n\nVogue continued that her mum allowed her back home after around three months, and the punishment had clearly done the trick, as she was well behaved from then on. It doesn't seem to have put too much a strain on the relationship either, with Vogue dubbing her mother her 'best friend' these days.\n\nWhile the model, who is married to Spencer Matthews and shares three children with the Made In Chelsea star, has fond memories of her childhood, she admits there are issues in the family.\n\nVogue herself is a big advocate for therapy and would love to talk over the past with her nearest and dearest, similarly to how many will be doing on her new podcast; The Apple & The Tree, where adult children will have the chance to ask their parents questions they have always wanted to know.\n\nBut the host, who also has a podcast with husband Spencer, won't be getting her own family on the podcast anytime soon, admitting that they aren't the type to air the past out.\n\n\"'I think it would be so beneficial for our family, but I don't think we'd ever do it,\" she admits. \"You don't want to bring things up from the past. You want to be all happy all the time. There are some things in my family we will never have conversations about. I know we just won't. Although there are things I would like to talk about I know it won't be reciprocated, probably.\"",

Its selling price has not been announced.\n\nAn EV boom in China that started three years ago has eaten into the market for gasoline-powered cars, but they are not dead yet.\n\nSo says Chery Automobile Co., China's biggest exporter, which told its auto show audience that it would continue to develop gasoline cars as well as EVs and hybrids.\n\nIts EXEED Yaoguang C-DM, a hybrid SUV launched last month, was one of four vehicles it highlighted - two hybrids and two EVs.\n\nThe Yaoguang SUV sells for 159,800 to 225,800 yuan ($22,000-$31,000) in China and is also aimed at overseas markets, a company news release said.\n\nHybrids, which have lagged EVs in China, are now seen as a growth opportunity. Last year, 2.6 million new hybrids were sold in China, about half the number of EVs. Together, they accounted for 36% of the market.\n\nChinese EV maker BYD, known for its low-cost battery technology and cars, is also going after the high-end market in China, defined as 1 million yuan ($140,000) and up.\n\nIts Yangwang brand introduced the latest version of the U8, a monster of an off-road SUV that was launched last September and is designed for survival in rugged conditions. It comes with a satellite phone in case a driver gets stuck beyond cell phone range.\n\nThe U8 is built on a platform that enables it to turn on the spot, like a tank. It's priced at 1.1 million yuan ($150,000). For 100,000 yuan ($13,800) more, buyers can add a built-in drone system.\n\nVolvo, the Swedish brand now under Geely, offered an answer for those overwhelmed by technology.\n\n\"The current EV market is marked by a prevalent trend of excess and addition,\" said Roger Yu, Volvo's managing director for sales in greater China.\n\nHe introduced the EX30 electric SUV as a user-friendly vehicle with a sophisticated sound system and a tablet screen that are both easy to use.\n\n\"By subtracting for ease of use and adding for safety, Volvo aims to give users the clearest interface, the most user-friendly operation, and the most reassuring intelligent experience,\" he said of the in-car screen.\n\nThe company announced that the EX30 would sell in China for 210,000 to 260,000 yuan ($29,000-$36,000).\n\nAssociated Press researcher Yu Bing and video producer Olivia Zhang contributed.\n\nVisitors look at a Zeekr Mix car during the China Auto Show in Beijing, China, Friday, April 26, 2024.

The hearing today was vacated and the application has been listed on May 20.\n\n'The defence skeleton is to be served by May 1 and the prosecution response by May 15.' Kerr did not appear in the southwest London court today, nor did any members of her legal team.\n\nSam Kerr's racial harassment court proceedings have been delayed after a request from her defence\n\nKerr, pictured with fiance Kristie Anne Mewis, is accused of calling a Metropolitan Police officer a 'stupid white PC'\n\nThe Chelsea and Australia forward has appeared at Kingston Crown Court via videolink\n\nPodcast All episodes It's All Kicking Off!

A source said she is accused of vomiting in the taxi during the evening, which came after Kerr scored a hat-trick against Liverpool in the FA Cup fourth round.\n\nThe Mail exclusively revealed that the 30-year-old was charged with racially aggravated harassment towards PC Lovell and entered a not guilty plea on March 4.\n\nA four-day trial is provisionally scheduled for February 2025.\n\nThe Matildas captain first appeared at Kingston Crown Court via videolink, and spoke only to confirm her identity and to enter a not guilty plea to the charge.\n\nJudge Judith Elaine Coello said it was understood that the footballer's defence would be that her intention was not to upset the policeman during the incident on January 30, 2023.\n\n'I understand that the defence is that she didn't intend to cause alarm, harassment or distress to the officer, [her behaviour] did not amount to it and it was not racially aggravated,' the judge asked Kerr's barrister, Grace Forbes.\n\nBut it is understood Kerr's defence is attempting to make an abuse of process application to have the case thrown out.\n\nIf the trial goes ahead it is likely to hear evidence from PC Lovell, with jurors expected to be shown bodyworn footage of the incident.\n\nKerr's hearing will take place five days before the women's Champions League final, which Chelsea hope to reach should they overcome Barcelona in the semi-final second leg tomorrow.\n\nThe Blues go into the tie with a 1-0 aggregate advantage thanks to a goal from Erin Cuthbert in the first leg in Spain last Saturday.",

That sparked a 1% to 3% rise in the shares of other big tech companies, including Amazon.com, Apple, Nvidia and even Meta Platforms, whose stock price tumbled over 10% on Thursday as the social media firm signalled its costly AI bets could take years to pay off.\n\nGoogle and Microsoft rallied on Friday as the technology bellwethers showed that hefty investments into artificial intelligence could reap more immediate revenue returns, a sharp contrast to Meta Platforms' view that AI is a long-term bet.\n\nMicrosoft's shares advanced 3.84% in trading before the U.S. market opened after the company beat Wall Street estimates for third-quarter revenue and profit, driven by gains from the adoption of AI across its cloud services. Google-parent Alphabet soared an even-steeper 11.5%, poised to top $2 trillion in market value, after not only beating quarterly estimates, but also rewarding investors with its first-ever dividend and a $70 billion stock buyback plan.\n\nThat sparked a 1% to 3% rise in the shares of other big tech companies, including Amazon.com, Apple, Nvidia and even Meta Platforms, whose stock price tumbled over 10% on Thursday as the social media firm signalled its costly AI bets could take years to pay off. The tech titans have been locked in a fierce battle in the race for generative AI, which can create text, videos and photos from prompts and is seen as the next frontier in tech. Analysts though are divided over whether Alphabet or Microsoft wears the AI crown.\n\n\"Microsoft continues to put together masterpiece after masterpiece as this quarter represents its dominant position in the AI Revolution,\" Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said. But Scott Devitt, Ives' colleague at Wedbush said, \"We think the results further validate Google's position as a leading AI beneficiary.\"\n\nMicrosoft has access to OpenAI's coveted AI technologies, which it has been working to infuse across its product portfolio, such as in Bing, Microsoft 365 and, most importantly, the Azure cloud-computing platform. \"AI services contributed seven points of growth\" to the 31% jump in revenue from Azure, Microsoft finance chief Amy Hood said.\n\nWhile Goldman Sachs said Microsoft is well positioned to replicate the success of its Azure build-out playbook in its AI-laced suite, Oppenheimer predicted the company's AI dominance would be reminiscent of a couple of decades back. \"We see it revisiting its PC-era-type dominance, but of a 1000x larger market as it is the dominant AI platform for enterprises,\" analyst Timothy Horan said.\n\nOn the other hand, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai touted Google's AI offerings as a boon to its market-leading service -- core search results. \"Google's Q1 ranked somewhere north of outstanding ... and management appears in better control of its own AI narrative,\" said RBC analyst Khadijah Gibson.\n\n\"Aside from a similarly-sized capex guide up as Meta, Google is more than weathering the GenAI concerns.\" If premarket gains hold, Alphabet, Wall Street's fourth-most valuable company, will cross $2 trillion in market value on an intraday basis -- a milestone it last hit, but failed to hold on to, three years ago, according to LSEG Datastream.\n\nThree of the so-called 'Big Six' have reported quarterly results so far. Of the remaining, Amazon, now the only one that does not pay a dividend, is due to report results next week.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "Last year is often billed as Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg's \"year of efficiency.\" Indeed, it should be billed as such. Meta earnings soared as the company cut expenses and started putting its AI to use to boost productivity (especially for social media ads), and thus earnings.\n\nDespite this boost to Meta's earnings power, there's still work to be done. The virtual reality (VR) segment Reality Labs remains a sizable drain on efficiency. Reality Labs gobbled up a massive $16.1 billion in operating expenses in 2023 alone, on revenue of just $1.9 billion. In Q1 2024, Reality Labs reported another $3.85 billion operating loss.\n\nBut Zuckerberg and company may have a solution, one that could make the sky (or maybe more specifically, the Horizon) the limit for Meta profitability.\n\nLast year, I highlighted how Meta's big bet on VR and the metaverse could get a boost from all of the artificial intelligence (AI) work the company is doing. Meta itself confirmed as much in December, sharing how its AI models are helping accelerate development of new features that help bridge the gap between the virtual and real world.\n\nBut one big pain point is metaverse hardware. These days, Meta now has sizable competition with Apple now that the Vision Pro is here. If VR (or \"spatial computing,\" as Apple insists on calling it) is to be a thing, Meta needs to drive more user adoption of VR devices. Clearly, even tens of billions of dollars of research and development spent on its Realty Labs segment won't simply do the trick.\n\nTo that end, Meta announced it's opening up its VR platform to third-party developers -- for both hardware and apps. Meta said this open ecosystem will be built on Horizon OS. Tech companies can now utilize Meta's extensive VR headset technology, human-machine interaction capabilities like hand and body movement tracking and real-world sensing to build their own hardware and apps on Horizon OS.\n\nThink of Horizon OS as Meta's VR metaverse operating system like the equivalent to Microsoft's Windows OS for PC or Alphabet's Android OS for mobile. Up until this point, Meta has developed most of its VR headsets, the Quest 3 being the latest, in-house. App development has also been done mostly by in-house studios, with third-party app developers working on an invite basis.\n\nIt would seem that Meta is looking to monetize all of its tech development via licensing deals to computing device companies, as well as, more broadly, opening up app development and monetization. Per Meta's news release:\n\nPut simply, a flood of new VR innovations could be coming our way in the near future.\n\nMeta is now sitting on years of elevated expenses in its Reality Labs segment. Meta has actually been quite transparent with those operating losses in the last five years. The segment has bled some $55 billion since 2019.\n\nData source: Meta.\n\nThose operating losses are incredible, even for Meta's mighty social media profit machine. Operating margin in the first quarter dialed in at 38% on total revenue of $36.5 billion -- the vast majority of that from social media ads, of course. Now imagine a Meta where VR isn't a major drag.\n\nIt's clear that one of the top ways Zuckerberg's \"year of efficiency\" can be extended into 2024 and beyond is to help transform Reality Labs into a component that's pulling its own weight. Turning all of the virtual reality and metaverse tech into a revenue-generating ecosystem of third-party developers could be a semi-fast-track to doing just that, although management said to expect Reality Labs operating losses to deepen \"meaningfully\" later this year.\n\nFor now, with efficiency gains from last year still boosting expected earnings growth in 2024, Meta stock still looks reasonably priced. Shares trade for about 20 times Wall Street analysts' expectation for 2024 earnings. I remain a happy shareholder.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Meta Platforms wasn't one of them.

        "text": "U.S. futures were up Friday morning after Google parent Alphabet and Microsoft shares spiked in after-hours trading.\n\nThe tech giants reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings after the bell, with Alphabet announcing its first cash dividend. Shares were up more than 11 percent pre-market. Microsoft was up nearly 4 percent.\n\nThis comes a day after the major U.S. stock indexes fell, weighed down by a one-two punch of economic data that showed growth slowing and inflation persisting.\n\nAlso dragging on the markets Thursday was Facebook and Instagram parent Meta Platforms, which saw shares drop more than 10 percent as investors reeled from the company's promise to spend more on artificial intelligence technology.\n\nInvestors' enthusiasm for AI is markedly high, driven by AI's transformative potential across various sectors, including healthcare, finance, and technology. This has vividly manifested in the stock market, with companies that are leaders or innovators in AI technologies having an outsized impact on gains and losses.\n\nFor instance, companies like Alphabet and Amazon have been focal points for investors due to their significant investments and advancements in AI. Alphabet has not only pumped billions into AI startups but is also expanding its AI capabilities into new areas like autonomous vehicles and AI-driven chatbots. Similarly, Amazon is leveraging AI in diverse facets of its operations, from e-commerce algorithms to cloud computing services provided by Amazon Web Services, which includes substantial AI integration.\n\nOverall, the prevailing investor sentiment around AI is one of optimism and strategic positioning, aiming to capitalize on the growth trajectory that AI technologies are anticipated to follow in the coming years. The stakes are high for these AI leaders to meet expectations and justify their share price.\n\nOn Friday, investors will be watching for the release of core inflation data released in the morning, which will impact the Federal Reserve's decision on whether to cut interest rates as it seeks to hit its 2 percent inflation target.\n\nOil giants Exxon Mobil and Chevron are scheduled to post quarterly earnings Friday morning.\n\nNext week is set to be another earnings-packed extravaganza for investors, with less focus on Big Tech and more on consumer goods.

        "text": "he other day I was hosting some out-of-state folks for a business meeting in Greensboro, and afterward I asked them what kind of food they were in the mood for.\n\n\"Oh, whatever you would recommend,\" one of them said.\n\nIn these cases, I don't necessarily think about my personal favorite or what I'm hankering for at the moment; I just want to choose something my visitors will find different and fun and maybe even memorable.\n\nI immediately thought of Pho Hien Voung, Jerusalem Market on Elm, Crafted The Art of the Taco and the Hops Burger Bar on Spring Garden Street.\n\nIf we'd been in Winston-Salem, my list might have included Mozelle's, Sweet Potatoes, Foothills Brewpub and the Carving Board.\n\nBut while I was sorting through this Greensboro menu of choices inside my head, like Arnold Schwarzenegger in \"The Terminator\" scanning his cyborg brain for the perfect action-movie retort, that same guest amended his wish list.\n\n\"But not Mexican,\" he said.\n\nImmediately, with Terminator-like efficiency, I eliminated Crafted, despite the fact that it offers Cuban, Korean and Nashville hot-chicken tacos.\n\nAs I was about to pull the trigger on one of the remaining three choices, my guest offered another refinement:\n\n\"Hey, how about some good North Carolina barbecue? Text us a place and we can all meet there.\"\n\nAnd they were gone to their hotels to freshen up.\n\nAnd this is where I'm going to offend somebody.\n\nI'm not saying you can't get good barbecue in Greensboro, because you can, but nearly every city in America has at least one place that knows how to smoke some meat. For something that will stand out, you have to drive a long way on back roads and stand in line for a long time and hope there's something left on the cutting block when you arrive.\n\nOn this day, we didn't have time to drive to Lexington or Ayden, so I texted a friend of mine who'd recently served barbecue at his daughter's wedding in High Point and asked for the name of the place.\n\nMy own daughter got married in Memphis and we catered Central BBQ and people were fighting to get the last smoked chicken wing. If you're picking a barbecue joint for one of the biggest parties you're ever going to throw, then it's got to be great, right?\n\nMy friend texted that his caterer had been Black Powder Smokehouse in Jamestown and that he'd highly recommend the brisket and the gouda mac and cheese.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nSo like somebody who knew what he was doing, I texted my business colleagues the address, and then I drove to Jamestown, which turned out to be a shorter trip than if we'd gone to a place in the city.\n\nWe had a great meal. Black Powder Smokehouse is one of those \"when we run out, we run out\" places - which I observe as a mark of excellence - and they hadn't run out of what we wanted. I got a quarter pound of brisket, a couple of spare ribs, some gouda mac, a couple of Red Oaks and a slice of peanut butter pie, and my colleagues had versions on that same theme including a Cheerwine chicken and peach cobbler.\n\nBy the way, you've got to love a place that sells ribs by the bone instead of the rack or half-rack. The perfect side dish.\n\nAnyway, I share this example to show that we're all making restaurant choices every day and that every decision we make and group we join and meal we eat is kind of a story in and of itself.\n\nAnd every time somebody makes a decision to take the plunge and start a restaurant, it's certainly a story, and often a terrifying roller-coaster ride that includes the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.\n\nThat's why we have a full-time food editor, Michael Hastings.\n\nSome of our most popular articles so far this year include Michael's stories about Ronnie's Country Store reopening in a new location and Johnny's Farmhouse closing.\n\nEarlier this month, Michael wrote about Kyndra Bell, a Winston-Salem woman who was working in a bank when she started making ice cream because she thought it would be \"something cute\" for her twin sons to sell in her cul-de-sac.\n\n\"It just kind of grew from there,\" she said. And it grew so much that she eventually quit her job at the bank to start a pop-up business called Dream Kreams. She survived through the COVID-19 pandemic, developed a loyal customer base and opened her own store on West Third Street last month.\n\nMichael writes plenty of stories like that. One of my favorites was about a Mexican-American family that moved from California for a better life and started a food truck called LaCallejera in Lewisville.\n\n\"California had gotten so expensive,\" said Karla Delgado, who started the business with her husband, Sol Muniz. \"And my mom was always saying, 'You should move here and get a food trailer' - so we did!\"\n\nThe couple opened their business on Thanksgiving Day. \"We figured what better way to give thanks than to work on the opening of our food truck,\" Muniz said. \"We actually had a good day.\"\n\nThese are stories that transcend the topic of food: they're about human beings overcoming obstacles to do something meaningful that makes all of us happy.\n\nWe're going to keep writing these, so let us know when you find more people and places like these with stories to tell.\n\nDimon Kendrick-Holmes is North Carolina editor for Lee Enterprises.

        "text": "Shares remain undervalued, and Google has four catalysts for a continual upside revaluation.\n\nAlphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) strong earnings sheet for the first fiscal quarter resulted in a 12% upsurge in Google's share price after-hours and the technology company seems set for a new up-leg in the near future as well. Google reported much better than expected results due to a strong, continual recovery in the digital advertising market as well as consistent results in Cloud. Google especially convinced with strong free cash flow margins which led to another surprise: the tech company announced the introduction of a cash dividend which is set to boost investors' total returns going forward. The dividend initiation is a game-changer for Google and I believe the risk profile remains skewed to the upside!\n\nI rated shares of Google a strong buy -- Why I Aggressively Doubled Down On Google -- after shares sold off undeservedly after Q4'23 results. Google's main digital marketing platforms, Google Search and YouTube, generated strong top line growth in Q4'23 and this momentum continued in the first-quarter as well. Google also saw a revenue acceleration compared to the previous quarter and investors can expect higher capital returns going forward.\n\nIt was a very strong first-quarter for Google which resulted in a sizable revenue and earnings beat. Google reported $1.89 per-share in GAAP earnings which beat the consensus expectation by a massive $0.38 per-share. Revenues also came in $1.84B higher than the consensus estimate.\n\nGoogle's core businesses digital advertising and Cloud both delivered strong growth in the first-quarter. Google generated $80.5B in revenues in Q1'24, showing 15% year over year growth as well as a 2 PP acceleration of its top line compared to the fourth-quarter. Both Search and Cloud did extremely well: Search generated 14% Y/Y growth driven by a strong state of the advertising market. Similarly, Meta Platforms (META) just released very strong (but less well-regarded) Q1'24 results, also due to strength in digital advertising. YouTube is also seeing strong ad momentum, driven by video ads, with the segment generating 20% more revenues than in the year-earlier period.\n\nGoogle's Cloud segment generated 28% year over year growth compared against a 26% Y/Y growth rate in Q4'23. Therefore, the two most important revenue drivers for Google, Search and Cloud, actually saw sequentially growing strength... which also resulted in an expansion of the company's free cash flow margins.\n\nThe key to understanding Google's capital return potential is the company's enormous free cash flow: Google generated $16.8B in free cash flow in the first-quarter, showing a Q/Q increase of 113%. Google was also able to more than double its free cash flow margins quarter over quarter due to strength in Search/video ads and Cloud, resulting in an FCF margin of 20.9%.\n\n(Source: Author)\n\nGoogle's free cash flow strength has now resulted in management for the first time ever announcing a $0.20 cash dividend, to be paid to shareholders on June 17, 2024, which is set to boost investors' shareholder returns going forward. Google also announced a $70.0B stock buyback again and it seems that Google wants to follow into the footsteps of Meta Platforms which announced in the previous quarter that it was becoming a dividend stock as well.\n\nIn the first-quarter, Google repurchased $15.7B of its own shares which calculates to an impressive free cash flow return percentage of 93%. The combination of a new aggressive stock buyback (which represents 3.6% of Google's market cap) and now the introduction of a dividend makes Google stock obviously more attractive to a wider circle of buyers now... which may boost demand for demand for Google's shares and push them into a new up-leg.\n\nFrom a valuation point of view, Google is one of the cheaper large-cap U.S. tech companies. Google is currently valued at a P/E ratio of 20X and is expected to grow its EPS at double-digits annually in the next several years. In my last work on Google I calculated a fair value range of $164-171 per-share for Google, but given the acceleration of the company's top line growth Q/Q, massive free cash flow (margins) and improved capital return potential, I don't see how Google could not trade at a 25X P/E ratio. This would make shares only slightly more expensive than Apple's (which have a 24X P/E ratio), but Google is more diversified and does not depend on the volatile consumer electronics market. Applying a fair value P/E ratio of 25X (FY 2025 EPS: $7.83) leads to a fair value of $196 per-share, implying ~25% upside revaluation potential based off of Google's closing price of $158 on Thursday.\n\nI continue to see massive revaluation potential for Google in FY 2024 driven by 4 catalysts:\n\nThe biggest risk for Google, as I see it, relates to the tech company's AI products. AI development is expensive and whoever has the most effective artificial intelligence product in Search, as an example, is likely going to dominate the market. This, in a certain way, equalizes the playing field and opens up Search to a wider field of competitors, including small AI development companies. If Google misses the boat on its AI development, the core Search business could become less valuable going forward.\n\nGoogle is at the cusp of another upside breakout given the positive market reaction to the company's first-quarter earnings sheet on Thursday. The continual recovery in the digital advertising business, signified by Google's double-digit top line growth in Search and YouTube ads, as well as Cloud momentum are key to my favorable outlook on Google's shares. Importantly, Google announced a dividend for the first time ever which is a game-changer as it boosts the company's cash returns to shareholders. From a valuation point of view, I believe Google has both a number of catalysts speaking in its favor and shares remain relatively cheap, especially when compared against other large-cap U.S. tech companies!",

The local vendor shipped 11.7 million smartphones, thanks to its popular Mate and nova series, while OPPO rose to second place on strong performance of its Reno 11 series, shipping 10.9 million units. Conversely, HONOR, vivo, and Apple all slowed their sell-ins in the quarter, ranking third, fourth, and fifth, respectively.\n\nHONOR shipped 10.6 million units with a 16% share, a year-on-year increase of 9%, while vivo shipped 10.3 million units with a 15% share, a year-on-year decrease of 9%. Apple declined the most among the top five, sinking to fifth from first place, with 10 million units and a 15% share, which is a year-on-year decrease of 25%.\n\nHuawei's performance is up 70% from a year earlier, when the company was still reorganizing its phone business following U.S. sanctions. Huawei's 5G Mate 60 Pro uses a China-made 7-nanometer processor tailored for the local market, showcasing the kind of advanced semiconductor manufacturing capabilities that US sanctions were originally designed to prevent.\n\nHuawei has since released its new Pure line of flagship smartphones, and has been busy developing its own operating system, HarmonyOS, since it could not use Google's Android and Google Mobile Services. The continued expansion of the HarmonyOS ecosystem breaks the two-horse race of Android and iOS in Mainland China.\n\nThe latest data is unlikely to make for pleasant reading for Apple's CEO Tim Cook, following his trip to China for the inauguration of a major new store in Shanghai. During his visit, coming on the back of a strong Chinese fourth quarter, Cook announced the expansion of Apple's R&D center in the city, highlighting China's crucial role in the company's strategy. Cook also attended the China Development Forum in Beijing, where he said the country was \"critical\" to Apple.\n\nApple is deepening its ties with China despite expanding production in Southeast Asia and India. Approximately 17% of Apple's net sales from October to December were derived from the greater China region, making it the largest regional supplier in the company's supply chain. But Apple is facing an uphill battle to reverse falling iPhone sales there, with a 24% year-on-year decline in 2023 projected to deepen through 2024.\n\nArticle Link: Apple Sinks From First to Fifth Place in Chinese Smartphone Market",

        "text": "The latest Canalys research shows the Mainland China smartphone market has finally seen a rebound after two years, with a Q1 2024 shipment of 67.7 million units. Significantly, Huawei returned to the top spot after 13 quarters, shipping 11.7 million smartphones and capturing a 17% market share, thanks to an enthusiastic market response to its Mate and nova series. OPPO rose to second place, driven by its Reno 11 series' strong performance, shipping 10.9 million units. Conversely, following a strong Q4 last year, HONOR, vivo and Apple slowed their sell-ins this quarter, and ranked third, fourth and fifth respectively. HONOR was third with 10.6 million units, with a year-on-year increase of 9%. vivo ranked fourth with 10.3 million units and saw a year-on-year decrease of 9%. Apple declined the most among the top five, with 10.0 million units, a year-on-year decrease of 25%.\n\nCanalys Senior Analyst Toby Zhu commented, \"The mainland China market's growth is still behind the global recovery of 11%, which allowed Huawei to seize market share and reclaim the crown quickly. The production and supply shortage of the Mate 60 series improved in the first quarter, propelling it to become the key driver of Huawei's overall growth. In addition to the high-end lineup, Huawei released the nova 12 series in December, which features Harmony 4.0, expanding the Kirin chipset to more product lines and successfully boosting performance in the mid-range price band. This month Huawei also upgraded the P series to Pura 70, featuring an innovative pop-out camera lens, further sparking market interest. A key strategy for Huawei in 2024 is to focus on building AI capabilities for smart devices from hardware to software at a system level, leveraging its deep R&D capabilities in AI infrastructure and solutions for industry and enterprise customers. With the continued expansion of the HarmonyOS ecosystem, Huawei emerges as the third OS for smartphones and other edge computing devices, breaking the two-horse race of Android and iOS in Mainland China.\"\n\nCanalys Research Manager Amber Liu added, \"Despite Huawei's strong start, we maintain the modest recovery forecast for overall market performance in 2024 growing at 1%. The talking point within the industry surrounds intensifying competition and innovation moat building. Leading vendors are narrowing their market share, which means exploring growth opportunities in different channels is critical to capture short-term opportunities. Vendors' go-to-market capabilities in multi-channel management, price control, and inventory management will be tested.\"\n\n\"The Gen AI-capable smartphone presents important opportunities for Chinese vendors to differentiate in the high-end in 2024 to challenge Apple in their home market,\" said Canalys Research Analyst Lucas Zhong. \"Canalys forecasts Gen AI-capable smartphones will reach 12% of shipments in 2024 in mainland China, ahead of the global average of 9%. Vendors are actively engaging consumers by developing interesting AI use cases and integrating AI features into their latest flagship launches with large marketing spends to educate consumers. In Q1, Xiaomi led in the Gen AI-capable smartphone market with its flagship 14 series, while HONOR explored its high-profile Magic 6 series with cross-device AI features with its MagicBook Pro 16. OPPO, on the other hand, pushed ahead with massive marketing investments on national TV channels, positioning its brand with AI features and innovation. We see an increasing divergence in Chinese vendors' R&D and AI product strategies this year, collectively driving further consumer awareness and adoption, which will feed into a sustainable monetization model.\"\n\nToby Zhu: toby_zhu@canalys.com\n\nLucas Zhong: lucas_zhong@canalys.com\n\nAmber Liu: amber_liu@canalys.com\n\nCanalys' worldwide Smartphone Analysis service provides a comprehensive country-level view of shipment estimates far in advance of our competitors.

        "text": "Global stock markets experienced a widespread rebound this week as tensions in the Middle East subsided, alongside robust quarterly earnings from companies. Sentiment appears to be recovering from a three-week sell-off earlier in April, which was triggered by escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, a hawkish stance from the Fed, and a surge in government bond yields.\n\nThe FTSE 100 reached a historic peak, surpassing its previous high in February, with a gain of 2.32%. The Euro Stoxx 600 saw a rise of 0.77%, while the DAX increased by 1.05% over a five-day trading period.\n\nHealthcare and consumer stocks demonstrated notable strength, buoyed by positive quarterly earnings reports. AstraZeneca saw its shares surge by more than 10% this week on the back of robust first-quarter earnings. The pharmaceutical company reported a 19% increase in revenue compared to the previous year and announced an increased dividend of $3.10 per share.\n\nSimilarly, Unilever, a British consumer goods company, witnessed an over 8% rise in its stock price over the past five trading days. This increase was fueled by better-than-expected first-quarter results, with sales revenue up by 4.4% year-on-year, topping the estimated 3.5%. Conversely, Nestle experienced a decline of nearly 2% in its shares following disappointing sales revenue figures.\n\nOn the banking front, Deutsche Bank and Barclays both saw substantial increases in their share prices, rising by 12% and 11%, respectively, over the past five trading days. These gains were attributed to stronger-than-expected earnings results from both financial institutions.\n\nMining stocks maintained their strength, particularly in the wake of Australian miner BHP's $38.9 billion takeover bid for rival Anglo American, which valued the company at the same amount. The announcement of this offer propelled British mining stocks to surge by 16% on Thursday.\n\nOn the economic front, the Eurozone's flash manufacturing PMI for April contracted, which is seen as positive news for the stock markets. The data may further encourage the European Central Bank to commence rate cuts sooner, which could be beneficial for market sentiment.\n\nWall Street is set for a positive close for the week amidst the ongoing US earnings season. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed by 0.26%, the S&P 500 has risen by 1.63%, and the Nasdaq Composite has advanced by 2.16% on a weekly performance.\n\nIn the past five trading days, 9 out of 11 sectors have seen positive gains, with Utility and Consumer Staple stocks leading the way, up by 3.26% and 2.84%, respectively. However, the Communication Services sector experienced a decline of 2.35%, primarily driven by Meta Platform's slump. Despite this setback, technology stocks demonstrated a strong rebound from the recent weeks' sell-offs, suggesting investors may flock back to the sector for bargains.\n\nThe US tech earnings painted a mixed picture. While most companies reported stronger-than-expected results, investors reacted differently based on their respective future guidance. Netflix and Meta saw declines in their stocks due to their weaker-than-expected outlooks. Conversely, Tesla, Alphabet, and Microsoft experienced surges in their stock prices on positive outlooks, with Tesla being the sole company to notably miss earnings estimates thus far. Apple and Amazon are slated to release their earnings results next week, providing further insight into the business health of these tech giants. On a weekly basis, Tesla's shares surged by 13.5%, while Meta's stocks slumped by 12%. Additionally, Microsoft saw a 4% increase, and Alphabet surged by 14% for the week after their shares experienced significant gains in after-hours trading on Thursday.\n\nMajor benchmark indices in Asian markets concluded the week on a positive trajectory, with Chinese stocks leading the gains. The Hang Seng Index surged by almost 9% for the week, buoyed by recent positive economic indicators and expectations of additional government support for the economy. Technology shares experienced a notable rebound following Beijing's announcement of subsidies for the procurement of domestic AI chips. Shares of prominent Chinese tech firms, such as Alibaba, Tencent, JD.com, and Meituan, all recorded impressive increases ranging between 10% and 18% over the week. Additionally, Baidu's stocks saw a substantial rise of nearly 8%.\n\nThe Japanese stock markets staged a recovery from the one-month sell-off, with the Nikkei 225 rising by 2.6% this week. The Bank of Japan (BOJ) held interest rates unchanged at between 0-0.1% today and would continue to conduct the bond-buying programme. The bank expects Japan's inflation to be slightly higher in 2024. However, the BOJ did not provide any commentary regarding the significantly weakened Yen, as the exchange rate of the US dollar against the Japanese Yen surpassed 156, reaching a fresh 34-year high following the decision.",

        "text": "CLEVELAND, Ohio -- In this episode of the Wine and Gold Talk podcast, the hosts discuss the pressure on the Cavs to respond after Game 3 embarrassment and the need for them to answer big-picture questions during the postseason.\n\nYou can also listen using your preferred podcast app. Subscription information is below.\n\nSubscribe and listen on Apple Podcasts or Spotify.\n\nRead the automated transcript of today's podcast below. Because it's a computer-generated transcript, it may contain errors and misspellings.\n\nEthan Sands (00:01.946)\n\nWhat up Cavs Nation? I'm your host, Ethan Sands, and I'm back with another episode of the Wine and Gold Talk Podcast. We're post-game three, so you know we have the perfect crew to analyze all the things going on after game three of this series between the Orlando Magic and the Cleveland Cavaliers. I got Chris Fedor, Jimmy Watkins.\n\nBad, ugly, disappointing. The three words that came to my mind while watching this game, Chris and Jimmy, because the worst loss in franchise playoff history for the Cleveland Cavaliers are the only words to describe this game and how it panned out. I mean, the Cavs were losing by 40 at one point, they ended up losing by 38. Chris, you were in the arena, and we're gonna get to the stats and all of those things.\n\nBut what were your emotions and feelings of what you saw with everybody in Kia Center tonight?\n\nChris Fedor (01:16.822)\n\nBam, 43, not 40. Let's not shortchange the magic, those three points, when they were leading. Look, I mean, to me, my big takeaway was that the many, many questions that people have about the Cavs, the many flaws that this roster, that this team does have, all of those were unmasked on one terrible night. But it's one game.\n\nNobody predicted the Cavs to sweep the Magic. No team is going to go undefeated in a postseason run. It was horrendous. I totally understand the frustration. I totally understand the anger. I totally understand the disappointment. Everybody inside the organization should have those same feelings, and they did. It was just start to finish, top to bottom.\n\noffense defense It was as bad of a basketball game that the Cavs could play and they picked the wrong time for it\n\nEthan Sands (02:23.91)\n\nI mean, we knew not to overreact to games one and two, but I think this is a time not to overreact to game three, maybe even more, because we knew that the Cavs needed to score 100 points to be competitive, not only in this series, but in the postseason as a whole, but to score 83 points on the opposing team's floor, it looked like these teams kind of flip-flopped, and then the Orlando Magic just...\n\nput on the gauntlet, wanted to put the foot down a little bit harder than the Cavs did when they were at home. Jimmy, what was your initial reaction to this game?\n\nI think it was fair for us to expect Orlando to have more juice at the beginning of the game. 100%. We all should have seen that coming, including the Cavs. And there's nothing they can really do about that, right? Because as much as they can say as they did at practice yesterday that they have to come out with the same desperation that Orlando has, that's impossible because they're not down 0-2 fighting for their season, right?\n\nJimmy Watkins (03:38.265)\n\nRecognize that you see they have that first little burst whatever when I would I would call it probably when Mitchell first went to the bench and it went from a three-point Deficit to I think a 12-point deficit when you checked back in That's where you got to make the adjustment and try to match meet Orlando where they're at and they just never did man it got worse and worse and worse and worse and ugly and non-competitive and\n\nLike, J.B. Bickerstaff's basically punting on the game in the third quarter. Like, it's... It's embarrassing! And it's, it's like, again, like Ethan said, I don't know that we should overreact to it. I don't know that we should underreact to it though, because... Like, this is the kind of loss that better wake you up, and it's sounding all these kinds of alarm bells. And there are, you know, anomalous things about this game, like, are the Orlando Magic gonna shoot?\n\nDarn near 40% for three again in this series. I don't think so, but we also have things that are trends now. The Cavs aren't making shots. They're having trouble scoring. This is, these are things that have been persistent problems that they haven't corrected now. So we gotta find a happy middle ground for distress here.\n\nI mean that's the thing about playoff series, right? They are an emotional roller coaster. When a team is winning the first two games, when a team is ahead in a series, when a team is doing things well enough to get wins, it feels like they can't lose.\n\nand then that same team turns around and loses, and then it feels like, well, there's no path for them to win again. Right? So I do think it's just about reacting to what happened tonight in Game 3, pointing out the flaws, talking about the things that they can fix moving forward. But one of the hardest things to do when it comes to a playoff series is trying to keep the emotions from overtaking all of your potential analysis.\n\nEthan Sands (06:00.11)\n\nAnd I know we talked about before this playoff series that Donovan Mitchell was going to try and shoulder as much of the burden as he possibly could. In the first two games, he wanted to start and spark the games and he came out and did that. And in today's game, one, he did not do that.\n\nto any extent, but 2. He also looked to have re-aggravated his knee injury, which could play a factor later into this series. And Chris, I know you talked about this a little bit in your post game story, and I know everybody's been saying that Donovan Mitchell says he keeps taking on himself. And he had 13 points tonight on 6 of 16 shooting. There were only two other players on the Cavaliers to shoot.\n\n10 or more shots, when is it going to be time for him to kind of point to everybody else and say like, I know I'm the leader of this team. I know I'm the star of this team, but I cannot do it without everybody else.\n\nChris Fedor (07:05.91)\n\nI just think when it comes to Donovan, guys, he's got to do what he thinks is best for him and the team based on how the Magic are going to go about defending the Cavs. And you mentioned it, Ethan. He had been trying to set the tone in the first quarter, trying to get this team off to good starts. In the first two games, he did that by scoring the basketball.\n\nNow, tonight he didn't get that opportunity. Number one, the Magic made a change. They put Jalen Suggs on him instead of Gary Harris. That was different. I think that the Magic felt like after the first two games.\n\nGary Harris is going to be good enough potentially defensively to disrupt Darius Garland in the state that Darius is in with the way that he is currently playing. So let's try and just be physical with Darius off the ball, on the ball, use Gary Harris who you know is accomplished defensive player throughout the course of his career. But let's try Jaylen Suggs on Donovan Mitchell. Let's throw a curveball. And beyond that, they took Jonathan Isaac out of the starting lineup and they put Wendell\n\nCarter Jr. in that changed their defensive scheme a little bit too. And they sent two guys to the ball to try and force Donovan into being more of a playmaker into being more of an initiator creator for his teammates. And they tried to get the ball out of his hands. Now Donovan had five assists in the first quarter, but the Cavs are at their best like when Donovan is going super Nova that just gives them a jolt.\n\nAnd it felt like because Orlando took the ball out of his hands, because they forced him to be a playmaker as opposed to a score. Um, it kind of disrupted the Cavs offensive flow and nobody was willing to step up and shoulder that level of offensive responsibility from a scoring standpoint. Um, so that's something that the Cavs are going to have to look at going into game four, but you gotta give Jamal Mosley credit for that. You gotta give Jaylen Suggs.\n\ncredit for the way that he just harassed Donovan, the way that he was physical with him, tried to stay in front of him, and now it's something that the Cavs have to figure out and try and counter.\n\nEthan Sands (09:30.186)\n\nYeah, and I mean, we talk about Donovan scoring being a factor. He scored seven of his nine first half points in the closing minutes of the first half and then scored.\n\nfour points in the remainder of the game. So that just shows one, how Jalen Suggs is as a defender and how we've talked about him as an all defensive team, second team level player for the series and for the regular season. And he deserves that recognition and how he's disrupted the offense for the Cavs. And...\n\nI mean, it's something that you don't see regular players come back from a knee strain in the first half and then come back to impact the second half of game two and then take over in game three. I mean, he had 24 points. He wasn't hitting shots in the first two games and then came back and just started splashing from three in this third game. So Jimmy, I want to look a little bit at.\n\nwhat Jalen Suggs' impact did for the Cavs, looking at how he guarded Darius Garland in the first two games, switching to Donovan in the third game, but also scoring and what he's meant for that Orlando squad.\n\nJimmy Watkins (10:47.185)\n\nSuggs is legit, man. He's a tough kid, clearly, the way he bounced back from that injury. If he's making shots like he was to, I mean, he's not gonna go nine for 11 the rest of the series, but if he's making shots at a level anywhere close to this for the rest of the series, it can really change the series. I'm just thinking more about what Chris was saying about the way they're guarding Donovan. Suggs being up to the task guarding Donovan.\n\nwe'll see about Donovan's knee and really if Orlando is going to defend Donovan as aggressively as they did tonight, if they're going to just say, basically we don't think the rest of your teammates are good enough to beat us four on three, I mean, that's, the Cavs have to, that's what every, like at a certain point, you have to start looking beyond this series a little bit, in big picture, that's what this playoff run is about, right? This is one game.\n\nWe need to take it as one game. It's an alarming one game. And we can try to learn and grow from it and try to, we'll get to this later in the pod. I think it's a good chance, maybe the first chance the Cavs to actually show how well they learned how to take a punch last postseason. But big picture, man. The offense cannot be cut off.\n\nas abruptly as it was when Orlando decides to put 2-2 on the ball like that. That's supposed to be played into the offense's hands. And it's not like the Cavs would tell you, in an abstract conversation, they would tell you that their team is built for this. They are built to be able to withstand a team that wants to take the ball out of Donovan Mitchell's hands. They feel really good about how Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen play in the big-to-big passing game.\n\nof this game, scoring with his little floaters when they were getting the ball out of Donovan's hands. Darius Garland, in a one on one matchup, I think the Cavs would tell you in an abstract conversation they'd feel really good about that. You do have to give Gary Harris credit for the way he defended Darius, and we do have to mention the fact that Darius is dealing with his back still, but the Cavs are saying it's the playoffs, he's fine.\n\nJimmy Watkins (13:06.785)\n\nSo we also have to be holding him to a standard that's better than two for 10 for five points. I'm not saying that he has to be, you know, $160 million Max Guy because we know he's not healthy right now. But you gotta be better than that. You gotta be better than that. And beyond that, Max Streus and George Niang, like, you gotta make shots.\n\nWe've spent a lot of time praising them for the other stuff they're doing in this series so far and that is all well and good. Max Deuce has been very impressive on the glass. George Niang has been I think like I think he's caught the magic off guard a little bit with how well he's held up defensively in this series but like you got paid the money to make shots you have to make shots.\n\nEthan Sands (13:54.21)\n\nYeah, and I think that's where we shift this conversation to the toughness aspect of it and how things have to pan out going forward. And I want to start with what you said about Max Streus' rebounds and you're absolutely correct in the first two games he was a menace on the boards. But tonight he had just one rebound. And I think now, because they entered the game 2 of 18 I believe it was from 3 point\n\nAnd now they're just, quick math, quick math, three of 24 and the only three pointer that they had tonight between George Nyang and Max Struess was from George. And like you said, I mean, they get paid to make shots. Obviously what they bring to all the other aspects of the game are good and dandy, but they need to knock down shots, especially if they're gonna put two on the ball, like you said, Jimmy.\n\nAnd then that also moves over to Jarrett Allen and Evan Mobley. We have talked all series about how Jarrett Allen and Evan Mobley have played so well defensively and have stopped points in the paint and things of that nature. Tonight, Paolo Bencaro was a menace. He was hitting turnaround jumpers, mid-range step back faders like.\n\nThere were so many different moves that he was pulling out of his bag and it just looked like he regained a different level of confidence that he had when they were in Cleveland. And Chris, I know you touched on the toughness aspect of it in your post-game gamer. So I want to get your ideas of what happened for them in the toughness department, especially from Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen who were held without\n\nTo me guys, this was the most bothersome aspect of tonight's game, from a Cavs perspective. There are legitimate questions about this team, it's toughness, it's mental toughness. It is abundantly clear that teams around the NBA think that the Cavs are a bunch of sissies. They talk to them constantly, they jaw with them, they celebrate in their face.\n\nChris Fedor (16:19.894)\n\nJaylen Suggs basically like danced in the face of the Cavs bench and was talking smack with Tristan Thompson basically the entire game. Paolo Banquero did the two small after scoring on Donovan Mitchell. So it's like, yeah, the Magic are mouthy and they're probably mouthier than they should be for a team that's losing a series two games to one, but it's up to the Cavs to shut them up and do something about it. And I'm not talking about Thru-\n\nthrowing a guy into the stanchion. I'm not talking about a flagrant too. I'm not talking about an ejection. It's just like have some toughness, have some pride, show some effort. Like match their level of physicality, match their level of intensity. For the Cavs to give up 14 offensive rebounds? Mmm. Paulo Banquero had seven on his own.\n\nUm, that led to 22 second chance points for Orlando. That was a concern that people had coming into the series. It didn't show up in the first two games. A lot of that is being out of position. A lot of that is effort. A lot of that is toughness.\n\nWendell Carter Jr. is different than Jonathan Isaac, right? He's more physical, he's bulkier, he's not as wiry. He's actually a center whereas Jonathan Isaac was a four that was forced to play center based on how the Magic wanted to construct their lineup. But like, you're gonna let Wendell Carter Jr. throw you around? Like, really?\n\nYou're going to let him hit you and take you out of position when you're battling on the glass? Really? Wendell Carter Jr. He's not Mitchell Robinson. That's not Julius Randall. That's not Joellen Bede. So I just felt from a Cavs perspective for all of the people that wonder about their maturity, their readiness, their mental toughness.\n\nChris Fedor (18:24.738)\n\ntheir physicality, their toughness in general. For those people that question it, the Cavs gave them more reasons tonight to do so.\n\nJimmy Watkins (18:38.341)\n\nYeah, that's what I was talking about with the immaturity point I was making earlier. Like it's one thing if your offense gets stuck in the mud on the road against a really good defense they make some, they shoot an uncharacteristic percentage from three point range. Like I could digest a loss like that. I could even digest, you know, a 20 point loss like that. That's these things that whatever they happen randomness, right?\n\nBut like, I really thought that these were the, this is the kind of loss that the Cavs should have left behind them last year. Particularly when the matchup is, we've seen the matchup be favorable to them. We've seen Jarrett Allen look like freaking Bill Russell at Rocket Mortgage. And like, because the venue changes.\n\nthe identity of the game changes. Like it shouldn't, that's what's supposed to happen to a team like Orlando, where half of the roster is making its first playoff appearance. That's not what's supposed to happen to a team that is like pushing its chips closer and closer to the table every off season and trying to, like the Cavs are trying to convince Donovan Mitchell that they are contenders and they are trying to tell everyone else that\n\nthat last year was just a bad matchup and we've learned so much from it, and so on and so forth, well, tonight it doesn't look like it. Again, one game, but it didn't look like it.\n\nEthan Sands (20:05.894)\n\nI mean, I think the biggest thing for me tonight is that Evan Mobley came away with 2 rebounds. 2. Both on the defensive end. Like Jarrett Allen had 8. He had 3 offensive rebounds. Sure. So they combined for 10 rebounds. Paolo Bencaro had 14 rebounds by himself. 7 on each end of the floor. Like that is.\n\ntoughness personified and Palo Somebody who is just getting his feet wet in the playoffs who is not used to this scenery not supposed to be used to the physicality that the playoffs bring and something that Jarrett Allen said that they felt like they had grown in department wise since last season Did not show that in today's game and it was something that stood out to me because\n\nYou saw it, as soon as Tristan Thompson jumped in the game, he checked somebody. I really don't think it mattered who was gonna be on the other end of it, but he was gonna check somebody. And... Obviously at that point it was too late. But... That's just like the mentality that I think I was looking for more so. Like you said, Chris, not so much as hitting somebody, but just setting a tone. Setting a mentality. Setting a mindset that you're not gonna get pushed around.\n\nespecially in a playoff game when you're up 2-0. And Karis LaVert said at practice on Wednesday, they were expecting Orlando to come out and play with a level of desperation. I don't think winning by 38 calls for desperation at all from this Orlando Magic team.\n\nThe other thing I would say about Paolo is that he looked real comfortable tonight, man. This is the Paolo that I was worried about at the start of this series. This is the kind of guy that you can coax him into the type of shots you want him to take, he can make them. My worry going forward would be this is the kind of game that carries over for a guy like Paolo. When it starts...\n\ncatches a rhythm like this, it can have legs. And if Palo, if you're gonna see more of this kind of Palo going forward, it doesn't always matter who you have on him. He's, I mean, it's not like, again, Palo, honestly, Palo could have, like the worst case scenario is he gets to the rim, right? Tonight, he's taking the shots you want him to take a lot of the time, and he's just making them.\n\nEthan Sands (22:52.774)\n\nI mean, he took 26 shots. That's the combined amount of Darius Garland and Donovan Mitchell from today's game.\n\nJimmy Watkins (23:00.709)\n\nHe took 13 in the first quarter. That's maybe there's something else in there like to your point about Garland. Like that's how you want, like if Palo said basically, if I'm going out, I'm going out swinging, man. Like, and that's how you want guys like that to behave. And again, I can't, I wanna color this by saying we can't know how well or not well Darius is doing physically, but like.\n\nYou need a little bit more verve. You need a little bit more stick your nose in there in these moments.\n\nChris Fedor (23:32.746)\n\nYeah, you could tell that, that you could tell that Paulo sensed the moment. Um, and there was urgency to the way that he played and it was a do or die situation.\n\nAnd he wasn't turning it toward Jaylen Suggs, right? He wasn't turning it toward Wendell Carter Jr. He was basically saying, I gotta go out. I've got to be aggressive. I gotta go out. I've got to attack this defense. There's been a lot of conversation about my turnovers that there's been a lot of conversation about Evan Mobley in the way that he's defended me. All right. I'm just going to put my head down. I'm going to do all of the things that I know that I can do. I'm going to do all the things for this team that I did.\n\nthe regular season. And I think the other thing that we have to point out is that the Magic were at home. This is one of the best home teams in the entire NBA. Young dudes play better at home, young dudes feed off the crowd, they're just more comfortable, they don't get caught up in the emotions of a playoff environment on the road which can be really, really hostile, really, really challenging, can rattle you a little bit.\n\n29 and 12 at home during the regular season. Um, and young players have a tendency to, to feed off of that and look more comfortable, look more calm, look more poised, look more at peace. And, and that's, that's what Paulo looked like. That's what Franz Wagner looked like. That's what Jalen Suggs looked like tonight.\n\nEthan Sands (25:07.65)\n\nAnd I read an article on Paulo Benquero that came out from one of my friends that just had his first byline dropping ESPN. And I was like, this is coming before game three down to oh, I was like, is this really the best time to be dropping this article? And now I'm like, he doesn't hit the bump button on this story because he's Paulo Benquero was called the franchise.\n\nHe is the Donovan Mitchell to the Cleveland Cavaliers of the Orlando Magic. Like, he is the guy that they build around. He's the guy that they went and got to make sure that they have success in the postseason. That's how you show it. 31.14 rebounds. It's insane to think in his first playoff appearance that he's having this kind of thing. Like, sure. He's had two games under his belt and he's been able to do these things.\n\nyear long and he had 40 plus points against the Cavs in the regular season So it's not something that we haven't seen from Palo but like just him being able to rise to the moment I like Chris said I think that's something that we need to take account of and try and see what's gonna happen for the rest of the series because like Jimmy said That looked like something that he could carry on especially in the game floor game for when they're still at home, but I think the one thing that\n\nthe Cavs did that wasn't horrible, that they had been struggling with for the other part of the series, was turning the ball over. Like they only had five turnovers from the starting lineup. Obviously they didn't play in the fourth quarter, so that kind of helps them. But I mean, just looking at how they were able to.\n\nturn the ball over even though they took 10 less shots than the Orlando Magic might be a positive to take away from this game. But Chris, what do you think? Am I just picking at straws over here?\n\nChris Fedor (27:14.878)\n\nYeah, I think you are. I think, I think even though the turnovers didn't happen, there was a level of discomfort that the Cavs felt on the offensive end of the floor. And I think there's been a relative level of discomfort that they felt on the offensive end of the floor in this entire series. And we talked about it following game two. Like we talked about all the flaws that we were seeing even mixed into the wins, right?\n\nThey were one of the worst offenses by, by rating in the postseason. They were one of the worst three point shooting teams by percentage in the postseason, and that was even in spite of two victories because they were able to lean on their defense. That was one of the like troubling aspects too of tonight is that, you know, I think a lot of people understand that this magic defense is really good. And.\n\nThe Cavs offense isn't the most dynamic offense in the world, right? But the defense was supposed to be the backbone for this team. The defense was supposed to allow, you know, bad shooting nights to not, um, spiral out of control. The defense was supposed to allow the Cavs to stay competitive in these games during the playoffs, even when Donovan Mitchell, um, looks uncomfortable and isn't, um, putting up the, the\n\npoint total that he's probably used to and having the impact on the game that he's used to. For the Cavs to give up 121 points to the Orlando Magic, the worst offense statistically of any team that made the playoffs.\n\nI mean, they had three quarters of at least 30 points. Hmm. This is supposed to be a defensive minded team. This is a defense first team and yes defenses have bad nights just like offenses have bad nights, but their effort on the defensive end of the floor, their communication on the defensive end of the floor, their attention to detail and sticking with the scouting report and all those different things.\n\nChris Fedor (29:32.874)\n\nThat just wasn't there at the level that it was in the first two games. And yes, there are some outlier things. And Paulo hit some tough shots and he made four threes and the odds of him making four threes in game four are very, very low.\n\nThe Magic as a whole made 13 threes as a team. They were plus 15 from three point range. So yeah, there's always going to be outlier type things within a game, within a playoff series. But the effort, the things that the Cavs can actually control, like that just wasn't there to the level that it needed to be for a playoff game tonight, especially on defense.\n\nEthan Sands (30:14.434)\n\nJimmy I want to let you get into this but I want to point out like what Chris said The Cavs allowed the Orlando Magic to score a hundred and twenty one points over the first two games the magic scored a hundred and sixty nine points in total that's a grass\n\nHere's another thing that brings it home. Think about this. In the first two games in Cleveland, the Magic through three quarters were averaging 61.5 points. That's through three quarters. They scored 61 in the first half.\n\nEthan Sands (30:57.338)\n\nJimmy, I'm gonna let you go, because you clearly got a lot to say about.\n\nJimmy Watkins (31:05.097)\n\nI mean it's gut check time man. Like I really think as much momentum as the Cavs built during those first two games, like the pressure pendulum has completely swung at this point. If for North, like, Orlando is like kinda playing with house money here, right? Like 47 win season is already a great accomplishment for them and.\n\nYou know, Mosley's a finalist for coach of the year because I think everyone recognizes they are ahead of schedule here. The Cavs have some big picture questions to answer during this postseason run. So the second that they are faced with adversity, now we're all looking at you. Spotlights on you, man. Like you, if you, like.\n\nToo many more performances like that, and we're talking about sweeping changes. Again, one game. But I think this is, I hinted at it earlier, I really think this is the first chance that we are even sniffing the same level of testing their playoff readiness that we saw last year. The first two games, it's great that they responded.\n\nIt's great that they improved upon their physicality. It's great that they controlled the glass. It's great that they played defense. Well now, now someone else punched you in the mouth. What happens now? What happens?\n\nEthan Sands (32:31.682)\n\nYeah and I think that's where I wanted to go next was the response portion of it because this is something that the Cavs haven't felt in this series yet. And obviously we want to look big picture here for the Cavs. Like there's a lot riding on this first round series. There's a lot riding on the next round because of what Donovan Mitchell has in mind for success of this season and some other players on this team as well. And I mean...\n\nJimmy you mentioned it, in the first two games the Cavs responded in different ways to the Orlando Magic's different runs. JB Bickerstaff was able to make adjustments that we had said were better than last year. But Chris I want to get your overarching perspective long term, what you're seeing right now, what needs to improve, but how this team needs to respond for game 4.\n\nChris Fedor (33:29.094)\n\nFirst of all, I'll say this, being in the locker room, there is still a ton of confidence. One player even said, we're going back home 3-1. So there is a belief in that locker room.\n\nthat they're going to find a way to take this loss against Orlando, use it as a lesson, and be better on Saturday. And I think Donovan Mitchell even said it in his post-game remarks, said, this is black and white. We know all the things that we did wrong tonight against Orlando. Yes, you have to give the Magic credit for the way that they played.\n\nthe adjustments that they made, they were smart, but like we just didn't bring it to the level that we need to bring it for playoff basketball. So now they've got to do that, right? That's what it comes down to, to me, is can you show a level of maturity? Can you show a level of focus from the very beginning of the game?\n\nCan you play with the intensity that's required at the beginning of the game? And can you show that? Yes. Even though, um, this was a terrible loss, even though this was an embarrassing loss, um, you're able to learn from it and you're able to be better moving forward. Um, like one of the things that, that I think people do still kind of like wonder about the Cavs is, okay.\n\nIf they're considered a front running team, like how do they handle this kind of adversity? Like the one adversity that we've seen them be able to handle is all of the absences within the roster. But like this kind of adversity, I think people have legitimate questions about how they're going to be able to respond to it. And now this is their opportunity. They say they're different. They say they're tougher.\n\nChris Fedor (35:24.438)\n\nThey say that they are mentally tougher as well, just like physically tougher. This is their opportunity to show it, improve it.\n\nJimmy Watkins (35:36.041)\n\nCan you just baseline? Can you play in one arena like you do in another? Again, I wanna reiterate, like that is little kid stuff. For the difference, like for the difference to be so drastic from games one and two to game three, your defense is overwhelming, strangling. It doesn't look like the Orlando Magic will ever score 100 points again at the Rock. And then you go there.\n\nand they score, I think I looked at it, they've only scored like 120 points like 14 times all year. So this is like, this is like peak Orlando Magic offense. And there's a lot more that goes into it, but venue change. I think that's a lot of it. You know, Orlando had some more energy, their role players were more comfortable, they played with more juice because they were at home. Just, just give me, can you give me consistency home and road? This is like, kind of like...\n\nYou know, 101 level stuff if you want it for playoff teams.\n\nEthan Sands (36:39.378)\n\nAnd I think it's a mentality thing. And we've said it all night long. One game doesn't define the series. It didn't define the series when it was game one or game two. But this one is different for the Cavs. It's a way that they have to respond afterwards. Go ahead, Chris.\n\nChris Fedor (37:01.662)\n\nI want to point out a stat because I was looking this up in the media center at Kia Center. So this was the worst playoff loss in franchise history. The three other ones before this were 2008, 2018, and 2016. The Cavs won all three of those series. So that doesn't mean that it's going to happen again the same kind of way.\n\nbut it brings home the point that a terrible playoff loss is just that. It is a terrible playoff loss. And the Magic don't get bonus points. This isn't a thing where they get bonus points because they walloped the Cavs. Game 4 is going to start 0-0. It's not going to start with the Magic up by 38 points. It's going to start 0-0.\n\nAnd this is just a thing that sometimes, as difficult as it is for people to understand, as difficult as it is for some people to accept, this is a thing that happens in the playoffs. It happens to teams that win championships. It happens to teams that flame out in the first round. It happens to teams that get to the conference finals. It's the playoffs.\n\nJimmy Watkins (38:27.805)\n\nCouple things on that real quick. Does it give the magic bonus points at tip? No. If the magic go up eight nothing, does eight nothing feel like 14 nothing? Maybe, maybe. Like there's a something, there can be, again, if we accept the premise that the Cavs are a front running team and they have something of a glass jaw, there can be with some of those teams like a oh boy here it comes.\n\nLike that can infect your team when another team goes on a run. And I also saw the stat about the Cavs losing bad playoff series. One this obvious point to make, they had LeBron on those teams so you know he has, there's two things there, it's easier to come back from this when you have LeBron. There's just an unshakable confidence that comes with having that guy on your team. There is also just an understat...\n\nthat goes both ways. It's easier to bounce back when you have a loss like that when you have Lebron on your team. It's also just easier for that to happen I think sometimes. Like Lebron had a very unique sense of when a playoff game was out of hand, right? And so sometimes he would just let the rope go and I think his teammates recognized that and so these losses\n\nmeant less in the moment too, right? Because like, I guess what I'm trying, these guys felt like, those teams felt like they could let go of the rope because they're like, we've been there, done that. This team has not been there or done anything. So I think it's a little different. People, it's not just the LeBron teams. Playoff teams have been losing ugly games for decades and winning series. I just think that when you're, when it's with a team that has...\n\nthat is so as unproven as this team, it's a little bit more concerning to me.\n\nEthan Sands (40:31.046)\n\nChris, it looked like you had something to add there.\n\nChris Fedor (40:34.434)\n\nWell again, it's not specifically that, okay, the Cavs have shown in past playoff series, when they get the doors blown off, like they find a way to rally. This is a different team, this is a different personnel. It's more of a broader point of one loss, no matter what the reason is for it, no matter what the margin is for it, does not necessarily carry over.\n\nThe Celtics won by 20 in game one, the Heat made the proper adjustments, and they were able to win game two on the road. Yes, the Cavs are not the Heat. Yes, the Cavs do not have Eric Spolstra. But it's a broader point of these kinds of things happen in playoff series, and it doesn't necessarily mean that it's predictive in either way. I mean, the Mavericks...\n\nwere down by a hundred points it seemed like in the first half against the Clippers in game one and they found a way, right? So the only thing that I keep going back to is that Playoff Series can get like this.\n\nAnd just because one thing happens one game, it doesn't mean that it's going to happen for sure a next game. Just like with the Cavs defense, right? Just because the Cavs defense was great in the first two games in Cleveland against the Magic, and they exploited all of the flaws of the Magic, it didn't mean that it was going to be great in game three. And it most certainly wasn't great in game three. So these things are very, very...\n\nI guess the way that I would put it is they're not predictive. And every game in a playoff series takes on its new life. And now it's up to the Cavs and J.B. Bickerstaff to make the counters that they need to make, the adjustments that they need to make, so that it can have a different outcome.\n\nChris Fedor (42:36.51)\n\nAnd I think there are things that the Cavs can do at a much, much higher level. And I do think that there are strategic adjustments that they can make, especially if the Magic are going to put two on the ball when it comes to Donovan or Darius.\n\nAnd I do think that at some point shooting variance is probably going to go in the favor of the Cavs because they aren't this level shooting team. They're just not. They didn't show that throughout the entire season. Their, their individual shooters are much, Donovan Mitchell is better than one of six.\n\nDarius Garland is better than 1 of 4, Max Deuce is better than 0 of 4. So at some point I do think throughout this 7 game series, and maybe it happens Saturday, I think the shooting variance is going to shift toward the Cavs.\n\nEthan Sands (43:30.098)\n\nAnd I know, unless you guys want to go into those little things that could be changed tonight, I think we can wrap up, but I have a first little fun thing, because I know this has been a rather negative podcast on the end of the cab. But Chris, do you want to go into those little things that you mentioned that using the cabs could do better?\n\nfor sure. Okay, so as you said, that someone in the Cavs locker room said that they're going back to Cleveland up three one.\n\nEthan Sands (44:13.318)\n\nHow do I put this? Do you think the Cavs are petty enough to pull up in all black fits for game four? And say it's like the Orlando Magic funeral for the series because if they go back to Cleveland, then they're gonna wrap the series up on their own turf.\n\nAgain, I know Chris is rolling his eyes. This is a fun thing. I just wanted to see what y'all would say and I already knew what Chris's reaction was gonna be.\n\nChris Fedor (44:47.454)\n\nNo, I don't think the Cavs collectively are going to show up and get caught up in that kind of nonsense and everybody wear black because it's a funeral. I might wear all black, but that's just because that's the outfit that I brought with me to Orlando. Black jeans, black hoodie. Gotta put some Air Force 1s with that too to get a pop of white. But I will say this. I will say this. The Cavs after the game.\n\nWhether they wanted to admit it publicly or not, you could feel it, right? You could sense it from the team. They were not happy with how much, uh, poop, let's say poop. The, uh, the magic we're talking throughout the course of the game, right? Like they were acting like a team that was up two, one in the series, not a team that was trailing two, one.\n\nAnd again, the Cavs didn't do anything to change that. They didn't do anything to stop that. The Magic had a great night. They deserve to celebrate big plays. That's what's going to happen, right? But there was essentially a feeling of, y'all weren't talking when you were losing by 20 in Cleveland, right? Y'all weren't talking when you couldn't score.\n\n85 points in either one of those games y'all weren't talking when you were looking completely overmatched outclassed Out-tuft out anything that you want to say so I do think That the magic gave the Cavs a little extra juice going into game four The guys have to do something about it. They've got to use it the right kind of way, but there was a sense of alright Y'all want to talk?\n\nOkay. That's fine. We're aware. We saw it. We heard it. Now we're gonna do something about it. We'll see if they do, but that was the vibe that I got being in there.\n\nJimmy Watkins (46:52.317)\n\nsomewhere in all black right now. Maybe it's the death of Cavs optimism on the podcast. I don't know. I would say this, I'm interested to see, are we going to get a close game? And if so, how does that look? Because these are two offenses that can get really stuck in the mud. So I would be very curious to see how that looks. Big picture though, man. I mean like...\n\nkind of again, one game, one game, one game. I got the, today was the first time in this series, even beforehand, I think we all picked Captain Six, where I got the vibe, I was like, could this be one of those like, it's one of those seven game series where none of the games are close, right? Like, it's just like an extreme swing from home and road. Like, could it be one of those series? I don't know, man. I've...\n\nMy confidence to the cat has been, maybe I'm, I think it's clear that'd be a bad playoff player. I'm just living and dying here. I'm living and dying with every piece of new information that I get, but I don't know. What's up?\n\nDid you see anything tonight out of this game that makes you change your feel on the Cavs' ability to win this playoff series?\n\nJimmy Watkins (48:12.741)\n\nNot when, I just think it could be longer than I thought.\n\nChris Fedor (48:17.142)\n\ngo seven instead of six? Like, we all picked six. We all expected Orlando to do something in this series.\n\nYeah, yeah, that's what I was saying. That thought entered my head today, yeah.\n\nRight, right, but I was leading five after game one. Like I said, I am, put me on the bench. Put me on the, put me the, put me on the bench. The lights are too bright for me.\n\nEthan Sands (48:31.406)\n\nI was about to say he was ready to change his pick. He was ready to change his pick after game one.\n\nWith all the drafting going on, don't let Jimmy near whatever you have going on.\n\nAll right now, Chris, Jimmy, anything else before we wrap up today's podcast?\n\nChris Fedor (49:02.066)\n\nNo, I don't think so. I think we hit on the key point. Again, the only thing that stood out to me is that every perceived weakness that the Cavs have showed up tonight. And I just cannot imagine a situation, and I could be wrong, maybe they're going to show up Saturday and be even worse, but I just can't imagine a situation where they play worse than they did tonight.\n\nThis was as bad as the Cavs could play at both ends of the floor. And for them to get physically dominated on the glass, I can't imagine that continues again. Maybe I have too much faith in this team. Maybe I have too much belief in this team. Maybe like the players who are feeling pretty confident, even after a 38 point beat down, maybe I just have too much faith. Um, but, but I just can't see them playing this bad two games in a row.\n\nYeah, I think I agree with that. I did think of something I saw tonight that gave me some doubt that Orlando could win the series. Palo was the best player on the floor. Like by a Grand Canyon sized margin. One game, yep. I've said it a lot. I'm trying to remind myself even when I say this. One game, one game. But if that is repeatable, that would make me nervous.\n\nI mean, we touched on it, depending on how Donovan Mitchell's knee feels, depending on whether Darius Garland wants to show his face in this series. But yeah, I mean, like we've said all night, it's just one game, we can't overreact or overanalyze as the Cavs still hold a 2-1 series lead, and after losing by the worst margin of deficit...\n\nEthan Sands (50:53.686)\n\nin franchise history, there's only up from here. So, until next time.\n\nYou say that and they're gonna find a way to go rock bottom.\n\nEthan Sands (51:06.519)\n\nWell, I hope that's not the case for what I just said. But until next time!\n\nAlright, anyway until next time that'll wrap up today's episode of the wine and gold talk podcast but remember to become a Cavs insider and interact with Chris and me by subscribing to subtext. This is where you can get insider analysis on the games as the game is happening or just join the Cavs community and conversate with me and Chris.\n\nor just scream at how bad the Cavs are playing depending on how the series goes. But to do that, you need to sign up for a 14 day free trial or visit Cleveland.com/Cavs and click on the blue bar at the top of the page. If you don't like it, that's fine. All you have to do is text the word stop. It's easy. But we can tell you that the people who signed up, stick around because this is the best way to get insider coverage on the Cavs from me and Chris.\n\nThis isn't just our podcast, it's your podcast. And the only way to have your voice heard is through subtext. Y'all be safe. We out.",

        "text": "Analytics company Canalys has released its latest report on China's smartphone market for the first quarter of 2024, and Apple has come off worst among the top five brands jostling for supremacy in Asia's largest economy.\n\nHuawei returned to the top spot after 13 quarters with a 17% market share. The local vendor shipped 11.7 million smartphones, thanks to its popular Mate and nova series, while OPPO rose to second place on strong performance of its Reno 11 series, shipping 10.9 million units. Conversely, HONOR, vivo, and Apple all slowed their sell-ins in the quarter, ranking third, fourth, and fifth, respectively.\n\nHONOR shipped 10.6 million units with a 16% share, a year-on-year increase of 9%, while vivo shipped 10.3 million units with a 15% share, a year-on-year decrease of 9%. Apple declined the most among the top five, sinking to fifth from first place, with 10 million units and a 15% share, which is a year-on-year decrease of 25%.\n\nHuawei's performance is up 70% from a year earlier, when the company was still reorganizing its phone business following U.S. sanctions. Huawei's 5G Mate 60 Pro uses a China-made 7-nanometer processor tailored for the local market, showcasing the kind of advanced semiconductor manufacturing capabilities that US sanctions were originally designed to prevent.\n\nHuawei has since released its new Pure line of flagship smartphones, and has been busy developing its own operating system, HarmonyOS, since it could not use Google's Android and Google Mobile Services. The continued expansion of HarmonyOS breaks the two-horse race of Android and iOS in Mainland China.\n\nApple is deepening its ties with China despite expanding production in Southeast Asia and India. Approximately 17% of Apple's net sales from October to December were derived from the greater China region, making it the largest regional supplier in the company's supply chain. But Apple is facing an uphill battle to reverse falling iPhone sales there, with a 24% year-on-year decline in 2023 projected to deepen through 2024.",

        "text": "The best music streaming services make your favorite music more accessible than ever. Streaming audio transforms your listening experience, bringing millions of tracks to your fingertips across all your devices. Many now also offer podcasts, audiobooks, exclusive content and videos.\n\nWhile you can save tracks and albums and curate your own playlists, the real magic lies in the built-in algorithms. These algorithms, the backbone of the best music streaming services, learn your preferences, crafting playlists and recommendations tailored to your unique taste.\n\nThanks to its easy-to-use platform and excellent recommendations, Spotify is still our top music streaming service for most people. But it's no longer the only choice and doesn't deliver high-res audio like rivals Apple Music, Tidal and Qobuz. However, with more competitors entering the space, knowing which is right for you can be hard. We've tested each one and although there are plenty of similarities, we've created this guide so you can find the best streaming service for you.\n\nSpotify is the best music streaming service for most people. In many ways, it's not just a music streaming service but an entertainment hub, boasting 100 million tracks, 5 million podcasts, audiobooks and courses.\n\nHowever, Spotify is more than a sizable library of aural delights. It also has a fantastic recommendation engine that learns your tastes and curates personalized playlists. My current favorite is Daylist, which changes throughout the day based on the types of music you usually like to listen to. Not only is it spookily accurate, but it's incredibly fun.\n\nSpotify is a playground of social sharing, themed playlists, captivating visuals, and a constant influx of innovative features. Its versatility across various devices ensures you can revel in its offerings wherever you are. While a UI update wouldn't hurt, navigating Spotify is a breeze, regardless of your listening platform.\n\nAdmittedly, Spotify falls short in one aspect: the audio quality. Competitors like Tidal and Qobuz offer superior lossless tracks. However, Spotify has promised a game-changer, Spotify HiFi, a lossless, CD-quality offering. While it's yet to materialize, the prospect of this upgrade is something to look forward to.\n\nRead our full Spotify review\n\nTidal is the best music streaming service for audiophiles, offering an excellent listening experience and a library to rival Spotify's, complete with curated playlists and exclusive content.\n\nLaunched in 2014, Tidal differentiates itself by emphasizing superior lossless and high-resolution sound quality and fairer artist compensation, boasting over 100 million tracks and a polished interface that might be my favorite in this guide.\n\nWhile it mirrors Spotify a little in appearance, Tidal excels in delivering CD-quality audio, making it ideal for users with high-end audio equipment, like the best noise-cancelling headphones and the best surround sound system.\n\nDespite facing competition from services like Deezer, Amazon Music Unlimited, and Qobuz, Tidal's unique blend of exclusive content, ease of use, and audio fidelity secures its spot as the preferred option for discerning listeners. But for those unsure about the Tidal hype, you can try a 30-day free trial to hear the audio upgrade for yourself. If the top tier Tidal HiFi Plus option is too expensive, try Tidal HiFi instead.\n\nRead our full Tidal review\n\nQobuz is a streaming service for the discerning listener who knows what they like and likes it in hi-res - maybe as downloadable digital albums bought at a discount on the Qobuz download store.\n\nQobuz might not be as fun as Spotify or as slick as Tidal, but you'll find plenty of exclusive editorial content (created by actual humans), a clear design and easy-to-find hi-res playlists with full resolution transparency - that's Qobuz's admirable USP.\n\nThe French music service also offers any music lover the chance to rent and purchase hi-res music even if they don't subscribe. That said, you'll get up to a 60% discount on your hi-res purchases if you do pay for its top-tier Sublime subscription, which includes on- and offline ad-free listening, a competitive catalog and all resolution clearly displayed.\n\nThe name comes from an ancient bowed musical instrument called kobyz, which has two strings made of horsehair. But although Qobuz is happy to look back into music history, it's thoroughly modern in its output of hi-res files - more so than most rivals we've tested.\n\nRead our full Qobuz review\n\nApple Music is the best streaming service if you love Apple. As you might expect, it offers seamless integration with Apple products, but it also boasts superior sound quality, including Lossless Audio, Spatial Audio, Dolby Atmos support, and a robust recommendation engine.\n\nSince its 2015 launch, Apple Music has expanded its catalog to more than 100 million tracks, matching Spotify's library size but focusing on a richer listening experience. Although it might lag behind Spotify in social features and playlist personalization, Apple Music's discovery tools, including curated playlists, music videos, and 24/7 digital radio do a good job at suggesting new tracks and artists.\n\nThe service stands out for allowing users to blend owned music with its vast streaming library. Apple Music also distinguishes itself with high-quality audio, available to subscribers at no additional cost, provided they have compatible equipment. This focus on sound excellence makes it a rival to other services in this guide, like Deezer, Amazon Music Unlimited, and Tidal, especially for those looking for an alternative to Spotify.\n\nRead our full Apple Music review\n\nAmazon Music Unlimited is our recommendation for Prime members. Like most of the streaming services in this guide, it has a huge catalogue of more than 100 million tracks and it combines CD-quality and Ultra HD audio files for those looking for the best sound quality. While its interface and recommendation algorithms may not match the polish of competitors, its extensive selection and high-fidelity streaming options make it a top choice, particularly for Amazon Prime members because you'll get a discount on the subscription.\n\nThis service consolidates Amazon's various music offerings into a single, streamlined platform, providing a range of listening options from free, ad-supported access to premium, lossless audio experiences. Unlike its rivals, Amazon Music Unlimited offers lossless FLAC audio up to 24-bit/192kHz, surpassing Spotify's 320kbps streams, making it great value for audiophiles, especially at the discounted rate for Prime members.\n\nBeyond its audio quality and expansive library, Amazon Music Unlimited offers seamless integration with Alexa and the broader Amazon ecosystem. Even for those not fully invested in Amazon's smart home devices, the service's competitive pricing, especially for high-resolution audio, makes it a good option for music lovers who are seeking both quality and affordability.\n\nRead our full Amazon Music Unlimited review\n\nDeezer has a library of more than 120 million tracks, all offering superior audio quality. While it may not be the leading choice for everyone, its minimalistic approach, combined with enhanced sound at 1411kbps - akin to Tidal's HiFi and Apple Music - makes it an appealing alternative for anyone look for simplicity and fidelity over personalized recommendations.\n\nSince it first launched in 2007, Deezer has maintained relevance in an increasingly competitive market, offering a free, ad-supported version alongside premium tiers. Unlike Spotify, Deezer focuses less on social integration and predictive algorithms, opting instead to provide quality audio and a variety of content, including podcasts and unique tools, like Songcatcher for music identification. Its curated playlists and the Flow feature do bring a fun tailored listening experience, though we don't think it matches Spotify's personalized precision.\n\nDeezer's user interface prioritizes minimalism, good news for those who might be overwhelmed by the complexity and cluttered design of its competitors. This simplicity, alongside its comprehensive music selection and higher bitrate streaming, positions Deezer as a worthy option for those valuing sound quality and straightforward functionality over extensive features.\n\nRead our full Deezer review\n\nIf you don't have any specific requirements for a new music streaming service and want to play music on all your devices, make playlists and see recommendations, you can't go wrong with any of the options on this list.\n\nThey all largely offer the same kind of service with a huge choice of music and cool discovery features. But if you're looking for something specific in terms of experience, audio performance or interface, that's when you can be pickier.\n\nFor example, although all the music streaming services we've included below have a similar interface, they're not the same. If the service you have in mind has a free trial, it's worth signing up to see if you like how it works and looks. Most people will get the hang of any new app after a week or two, but we found Spotify and Tidal to be the slickest and most intuitive.\n\nWhat's more, you'll need to check if your favorite artists are available on the music streaming platform you're considering signing up for. These days, most artists are on most platforms, but a few still crop up on some and not others.\n\nOver the years, many of the best music streaming services in this list have also improved the quality of the tracks they offer, with Apple Music and Amazon Music Unlimited now both adding high-res audio to their platforms.\n\nFinally, if music discovery is important to you because you're overwhelmed by the millions of tracks you could be listening to each day, you'll find solid reacommendations from all of these services but Spotify is the best.\n\nWe tested the best music streaming services by signing up for the premium tier of each, so we could get a good indication about what the experience is like at the highest audio quality setting.\n\nWe also made sure we were using high-end audio equipment to get the best possible experience, testing the services on a range of the best headphones and best noise-cancelling headphones. We listened from a range of devices as well, including different smartphones, laptops and speaker systems.\n\nTo make sure we were testing the recommendation engines fully we made sure we were actively listening to our favorite tracks and artists, favoriting them and adding them to our own playlists in order to get the most from the customized ones that would be generated a few days and weeks into testing.\n\nOther than those specific points, we also tested all of the major features of the best music streaming services, like social sharing, playlist creation, audiobooks, lyric viewing, quizzes and more. We know that everyone uses the best music streaming services in different ways and wanted to be sure we were testing everything that matters.",

        "text": "BEIJING -- China's vision of the future of the automobile -- electrified and digitally connected -- is on display at the ongoing Beijing auto show.\n\nOrganizers say that 117 new models are making their debut at Auto China 2024, which runs through May 4. They range from eye-poppingly cutting edge to more subtle novelties.\n\nTHE CONNECTED CAR\n\nOne of the biggest mob scenes was for the opening day presentation by Xiaomi, a major Chinese maker of smartphones and trendy, affordable smart appliances aimed at younger generations that's entering the car market for the first time.\n\nXiaomi announced that it had received more than 75,000 orders in the four weeks since the launch of its first car, the SU7, with a list price of 215,900 to 299,900 yuan ($29,800-$41,400).\n\nWhy is a phone company making a car? Analysts say connectivity. Consumer technology companies want to connect the lives of their customers across all their devices -- phones, laptops, televisions and now cars.\n\n\"It starts with the concept of the third place,\" said Beatrix Keim, the China director at German auto research center CAR. \"Because nowadays people are at the office, at home and then mainly they're spending the time in the car.\"\n\nThe approach works well in China, a highly digital society where e-payments are the norm and the convenience of connectivity trumps privacy concerns for most.\n\nChinese telecom giant Huawei has ventured into the car business too. Apple explored the idea but dropped it earlier this year.\n\nTHE CAR AS LIVING SPACE\n\nSome Chinese makers are taking the idea of a third space to new heights.\n\nZeekr unveiled the Mix, an electric vehicle with an interior that can transform into a small room while parked. The front seats swivel to face the back ones, with a table in between that a company executive told the crowd could be used to play card games or enjoy a Chinese hot-pot meal.\n\nStefan Sielaff, the design director of Zeekr, described the Mix as \"a nice experiment\" focusing on younger families.\n\n\"I wouldn't even call it a car or an MPV or a van,\" he said. \"It's more a lifestyle capsule. It's an iPod on wheels.\"\n\nIt will be the fifth model for Zeekr, a 2 1/2-year-old premium EV brand of China's Geely group, a major maker that owns Volvo and has designers in Sweden and Shanghai.\n\nThe Mix will go on sale in China by the end of June, the company said. Its selling price has not been announced.\n\nTHE HYBRID APPROACH\n\nAn EV boom in China that started three years ago has eaten into the market for gasoline-powered cars, but they are not dead yet.\n\nSo says Chery Automobile Co., China's biggest exporter, which told its auto show audience that it would continue to develop gasoline cars as well as EVs and hybrids.\n\nIts EXEED Yaoguang C-DM, a hybrid SUV launched last month, was one of four vehicles it highlighted -- two hybrids and two EVs.\n\nThe Yaoguang SUV sells for 159,800 to 225,800 yuan ($22,000-$31,000) in China and is also aimed at overseas markets, a company news release said.\n\nHybrids, which have lagged EVs in China, are now seen as a growth opportunity. Last year, 2.6 million new hybrids were sold in China, about half the number of EVs. Together, they accounted for 36% of the market.\n\nTHE LUXURY TANK\n\nChinese EV maker BYD, known for its low-cost battery technology and cars, is also going after the high-end market in China, defined as 1 million yuan ($140,000) and up.\n\nIts Yangwang brand introduced the latest version of the U8, a monster of an off-road SUV that was launched last September and is designed for survival in rugged conditions. It comes with a satellite phone in case a driver gets stuck beyond cell phone range.\n\nThe U8 is built on a platform that enables it to turn on the spot, like a tank. It's priced at 1.1 million yuan ($150,000). For 100,000 yuan ($13,800) more, buyers can add a built-in drone system.\n\nA SIMPLER APPROACH\n\nVolvo, the Swedish brand now under Geely, offered an answer for those overwhelmed by technology.\n\n\"The current EV market is marked by a prevalent trend of excess and addition,\" said Roger Yu, Volvo's managing director for sales in greater China.\n\nHe introduced the EX30 electric SUV as a user-friendly vehicle with a sophisticated sound system and a tablet screen that are both easy to use.\n\n\"By subtracting for ease of use and adding for safety, Volvo aims to give users the clearest interface, the most user-friendly operation, and the most reassuring intelligent experience,\" he said of the in-car screen.\n\nThe company announced that the EX30 would sell in China for 210,000 to 260,000 yuan ($29,000-$36,000).",

        "text": "Collaboration with Nan Ya PCB hints at innovative design changes.\n\nApple has built a knack for squeezing more power and functionality into their devices.\n\nThey did it with the iPhone, they are doing it with the Mac and iPads, and now the next-generation Apple Watch might just be the beneficiary of a game-changing material.\n\nAccording to the grapevine, Apple is considering the use of Resin-Coated Copper (RCC) for the motherboard of at least one of their upcoming Apple Watch models, and the implications are pretty exciting.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the magic of RCC, we'll break it down for you.\n\nResin-Coated Copper is exactly what it sounds like - a thin layer of copper coated in resin.\n\nThis material replaces the typically green, grey, or black non-conductive bonding sheet material found on traditional motherboards, and the benefits are twofold.\n\nFirst and foremost, RCC is incredibly space-efficient, which is a crucial consideration for compact devices like smartwatches.\n\nApple could potentially free up valuable real estate within the watch's chassis, leaving more room for other components, such as a larger battery or additional sensors.\n\nSecondly, RCC is designed to be more cost-effective and environmentally friendly than traditional motherboard materials.\n\nApple has been quite outspoken as of late regarding its impact on the environment.\n\nUsing RCC could be a small but significant ( do you know how big Apple is?) step in the right direction.\n\nThe Apple Watch is gathering interest in general, not least because the product is approaching its 10 year anniversary.\n\nApple's potential adoption of RCC for their upcoming Apple Watch comes from the ever-reliable supply chain sources cited by Digitimes.\n\nAccording to the report, Apple is once again collaborating with Nan Ya PCB, a company that has previously worked with the tech giants on space-saving designs for their smartwatches.\n\nWhile multiple reports have hinted at the development of an \"Apple Watch X\" model, details about its launch timeline remain shrouded in mystery.\n\nEarlier whispers suggested a 2023 release, but Apple ended up introducing the Apple Watch Series 9 last year alongside their iPhone 15 lineup.\n\nNot at all! RCC is primarily a space-saving solution and is not expected to have any direct impact on the watch's performance.\n\nIn fact, the freed-up space could potentially allow for more powerful components or a larger battery, potentially enhancing the overall user experience.\n\nUnfortunately, no. Rumours suggest that the \"Apple Watch X\" will feature a new magnetic band system, which means that your current Apple Watch bands won't be compatible with the new design.\n\nAside from the potential use of RCC and a new band system, the \"Apple Watch X\" is rumoured to feature a thinner design, a microLED display (an upgrade from the current OLED screens), and new sensors capable of monitoring the wearer's blood pressure.\n\nWhile not confirmed, the use of RCC could potentially allow for a larger battery in the \"Apple Watch X,\" which would naturally translate to improved battery life.\n\nAdditionally, recent reports suggest that the upcoming Apple Watch lineup could feature upgraded displays with improved battery efficiency.\n\nAlso Read: Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 Lose Blood Oxygen Feature: All You Need To Know About This Patent Dispute\n\nAlso Read: Hermès Phases Out Apple Watches, While New Series 9 Set to Redefine Precision",

        "text": "The Virginia Board of Education approved $25.4 million for six new lab schools Thursday as state officials find ways to accelerate the approval process to use the existing lab school funding before the current budget cycle ends.\n\nSome education officials worry that the expedited approval process might affect the quality of lab school plans, but proponents say officials thoroughly vet the applications.\n\nLab schools, which are Gov. Glenn Youngkin's signature school choice initiative, are partnerships between universities and school divisions that provide nonreligious education to K-12 students. They are open to the public and do not charge tuition. Similar to charter schools, they can set their own budgets and curricula. Although lab schools receive public funding, they are expected to be financially self-sufficient within a few years.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Camp Community College, which serves the cities of Franklin and Suffolk and the counties of Isle of Wight and Southampton.\n\nYoungkin said in a statement: \"With the addition of these six Lab Schools, the Board has created enriching, future-focused opportunities that reach students across Virginia.\n\n\"These schools are establishing innovative pathways for students to explore potential careers and be better prepared for the future, with a specific focus on addressing the needs and demands of their regions. These Lab Schools are not just shaping the future of our students, they're also shaping the future of Virginia.\"\n\nYoungkin won a partial victory for his lab school proposal in 2022. Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears broke a tie vote in the Senate to rescue his amendment to triple the number of higher education institutions that can partner with local school divisions. The Senate then voted to block his proposal to use state per-pupil funds to pay for them.\n\nFunding in question\n\nThe governor and the General Assembly have not yet worked out a budget deal for the two-year cycle that begins July 1, so it is unclear whether it will include lab school funding. Lawmakers return to Richmond May 13 in a renewed effort to reach a budget agreement.\n\nThe budget the General Assembly approved in March did not include Youngkin's proposal for an additional $60 million for lab schools. It also reallocated to the state's general fund the $85.1 million of unused lab school funding from the original $100 million allocation in 2022.\n\n\"If we wait for the General Assembly to figure this out, we may be waiting for a while,\" said Andy Rotherham, a member of the Board of Education. \"We can't be hostage to that. We have to move forward.\"\n\nTo use the $100 million allocation of lab school funding in the current budget, representatives of the higher education institution the state education department must sign contracts before June 30, the last day the current spending plan covers. The contract process, which happens after the Board of Education's approval, involves lawyers and a review by the Virginia Attorney General's Office.\n\nAny contracts signed after June 30 would pull money from the upcoming budget, which might not include any lab school funding if the legislature gets its way.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nAnne Holton, the only holdover board member that Youngkin did not appoint, cast the only dissenting votes on Thursday. Holton abstained from voting on George Mason because she is a faculty member and served as interim president of the university from 2019 to 2020.\n\n\"I object on doing the first and final review in one meeting contrary to our norms, simply because the budget for these schools is so up in the air, and I think it is potentially counterproductive,\" said Holton, a former state secretary of education and Virginia first lady. \"I will vote no, even though I think there are some terrific applications in there, because I don't think we should go first and final today.\"\n\nHolton especially objected to the approval of Roanoke College's application, which the school submitted in February, as its financial sustainability plan is unclear. Although lab schools receive start-up funds from the state, they are expected to be financially independent within a few years.\n\n\"I'm concerned that in our haste to get these done quickly, we're lowering the standards ... just to get it done fast,\" Holton said.\n\nRotherham said the board's votes of approval come at the end of a lengthy, vetted process.\n\n\"There's always some risk here ... Is every lab school we're going to create through this process going to thrive despite our best efforts? Probably not,\" Rotherham said. \"...We are doing our best as a committee and it is ultimately incumbent on these universities to live up to their responsibility to do this. I'm confident Roanoke is serious about what they're trying to do here.\"\n\nAccelerated approval process\n\nThe eight lab schools the board approved this month -- including the six new ones -- were green-lighted on first review and the board did not use the standard process that requires more time and multiple rounds of review.\n\nGrace Creasey, the Board of Education's president, announced Thursday that the board will hold a special meeting May 21. There is no set agenda yet. The Lab School Committee meets May 9, and will likely approve recommendations for the board to approve more lab schools.\n\nThere are a few more lab school applications in the pipeline.\n\nAfter the board approved $10 million for two new lab schools earlier this month, state Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, chair of the Senate Finance and Appropriations Committee, called the lab school approvals counterproductive to ongoing budget discussions. She said she wonders how the board will pay for the lab schools since the legislature removed the funding from the assembly's budget.\n\nThe lab school standing committee, which reviews lab school applications before the Board of Education, sped up its process April 11 by eliminating the standard second review of applications and instead recommending the approval of lab schools upon first review. The committee voted 3-2 to approve the process change. The committee's chair and vice chair raised concerns about rushing the process and forgoing the standard process that applies to all state Board of Education standing committees.\n\nYoungkin and General Assembly leaders last week declared a working truce in their ongoing battle over taxes and spending. They have been at odds over the $188 billion two-year budget that the Democratic-controlled legislature adopted last month and the Republican governor tried unsuccessfully to amend last week.\n\nLawmakers and Youngkin are working to fashion a budget agreement to prevent a government shutdown when the fiscal year ends on June 30.\n\nThe Youngkin administration says that Virginia is obligated to fund lab schools according to the budget Youngkin signed in 2022, which is law until the governor signs a new budget.\n\nTop 5 weekend events: Herbs Galore, Shakespeare's Birthday, Ashland Train Day Herbs Galore Shakespeare's Birthday Ashland Train Day Richmond Restaurant Week Swine & Brine Richmond Animation Festival\n\nAnna Bryson (804) 649-6922\n\nabryson@timesdispatch.com\n\nAnna Bryson\n\nYouth Issues/Families and Education Reporter\n\nAuthor twitter Author email Follow Anna Bryson Close Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!

        "text": "This vignette is an educational moment in American history. It is about those who made a difference during the Revolutionary War era and how they served our country.\n\nDuring the fall and winter of 1777-18, the British military brought the Continental Army to its knees. In September 1777, British army commander Gen. William Howe triumphed over Gen. Washington at the Battle of Brandywine. With over 1,000 patriot losses, they retreated. This situation allowed the British to occupy Philadelphia.\n\nA month later, on Oct. 4, 1777, Gen. Washington and Howe faced off again at Germantown, Pennsylvania. The patriots became disoriented in a thick fog, leading to substantial friendly fire injuries and deaths. This dire situation again resulted in a \"general retreat\" by Gen. Washington's soldiers.\n\nAfter considering several locations, Washington chose Valley Forge for his army to take refuge in and recuperate during the winter. This settlement, close to Philadelphia, prevented the British from invading the interior of Pennsylvania. Valley Forge was also \"far enough away to halt the threat of British surprise attacks.\" Further, the Schuylkill River's geography and banks enabled sentries to see if any Redcoats were advancing.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The frigid weather made getting essential supplies to the troops almost impossible. The American troops needed clothing, medical care and food. They were distressed, freezing and starving. Enter Polly Cooper of the Oneida Indian Nation.\n\nA select group of Oneida, including Cooper, made the grueling journey, bringing food and supplies \"boosting the morale of the hungry soldiers at a critical time during the war.\" The Oneida had trekked several hundred miles from Central New York. However, the hundreds of bushels of white corn the Oneida brought with them required a unique cooking process. Upon the Oneida's arrival, some starving soldiers immediately grabbed and started to eat the raw corn. Polly stopped them, explaining that if consumed uncooked, this corn would kill them by bloating their stomachs.\n\nPolly had volunteered to make the journey to Valley Forge to help the soldiers. Her motivation \"was freedom in thought to develop principles for the good of all living and the coming generations.\" When it was time for the Oneidas to leave, Polly stayed to cook, feed, and care for the troops. She refused any pay for her help.\n\nDiscovering that Polly was interested in a particular bonnet and shawl, army officers and the federal government raised money for this gift. For her heroic service, Martha Washington presented the bonnet and shawl to her. Polly treasured her beloved garments, and her descendants have continued to value and preserve them.\n\nOver the years, Polly has been honored in several ways. Her shawl is occasionally exhibited to the public, and the Polly Cooper Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution keeps her legacy alive. A sculpture featuring Cooper is permanently displayed in the Smithsonian's National Museum of the American Indian. This exhibition commemorates the alliance between the Oneida Nation and the United States.

The search giant also authorized $70 billion in new share repurchases. The company is sitting on $108 billion in cash.\n\n\"We've had a share repurchase program for quite some time that we've been growing over the years. And we felt, as I said, that this further strengthens our overall capital return program. You know, to be clear, I've talked about the capital allocation framework for quite some time, and it does remain the same\", Ruth Porat, Google President and Chief Investment Officer told FOX Business' Susan Li.\n\nPorat was most recently CFO, and a search remains underway for her replacement in that role.\n\nShares rallied in after-hours trading, sending the market value past $2 trillion and adding to the 11% run-up this year.\n\nCEO Sundar Pichai doubled down on the company's commitment to advancing AI throughout its businesses after revenue topped $80 billion, up 15% from a year ago, and profits jumped 61% to $1.89 per share.\n\nORACLE WILL RELOCATE HEADQUARTERS TO NEW CITY\n\n\"It was a great quarter led by strong performance from Search, YouTube and Cloud. Today, I want to share how we are thinking about the business and the opportunity more broadly. Of course, that's heavily focused on AI and search\" Sundar Pichai, Google CEO, told investors on the earnings conference call.\n\nSundar recently made headlines for firing a group of workers who staged anti-Israel protests that led to protests for other causes in the office. In a detailed memo, he said such acts would not be tolerated in the workplace.\n\nGOOGLE FIRES WORKERS WHO PROTESTED IN THE OFFICE\n\nMark Zuckerberg's Meta, which is also in the AI race, initiated a $0.50 cent dividend earlier this year, which was paid March 26. Facebook's parent company reported results Wednesday, Zuckerberg warned heavy AI spending may take a while to pay off.\n\n\"As we're scaling CapEx and energy expenses for AI, we'll continue focusing on operating the rest of our company efficiently, but, realistically, even with shifting many of our existing resources to focus on AI, we'll still grow our investment envelope meaningfully before we make much revenue from some of these products,\" he told analysts and investors tuned into the call.\n\nShares tumbled 10.56%, the worst session since Oct. 27, 2022. Shares have still gained over 24% this year.\n\nOther tech giants paying dividends include Apple and Microsoft. Amazon remains the holdout.",

Listen on Spotify, Apple or anywhere you get your podcasts\n\nAny England fans addicted to fruit should gobble their healthy snacks before entering stadiums at Euro 2024 - because they're officially banned.\n\nAn apple or banana is a seemingly innocuous treat that some might be tempted to take into stadiums, but such smuggling comes with high risk.\n\nThat's because supporters who do so could be expulsed from the ground and banned from attending any subsequent matches at the tournament.\n\nUEFA's list of prohibitions for the tournament actually prohibits fans from bringing any food or liquid into grounds, but they make a particular point about the fruity goods, writing: 'including fruit, such as apples, bananas, oranges, etc.'\n\nIf anybody needs them for medical reasons, that's okay, but the stadium authorities must be notified in advance.\n\nSupporters will be banned from taking fruit into Euro 2024 stadiums and could be banned from the whole tournament for doing so\n\nDevastatingly, fans will also be barred from taking ladders and vuvuzelas into the grounds\n\nPodcast All episodes It's All Kicking Off! 'He's reaching De Bruyne levels' listen now PODCAST: Listen to our EXCLUSIVE interview with Phil Foden IAKO! - Nottingham Forest are making fools of themselves! It's All Kicking Off! - Can City overcome Chelsea in FA Cup Showdown? It's All Kicking Off! - OFFICIAL Man City win the Premier League again Play on Apple Spotify\n\nThe Sun reports that the food ban is in place to boost Germany's sausage sales during the tournament, which runs from June 14 to July 14.\n\nA standard sausage at a ground will set fans back £3.77 and if you're lucky enough to attend the final, your wallet will be complaining at an enhanced sausage tax: £4.77.\n\nEngland begin their Euro 2024 campaign against Serbia on June 16 at the Arena AufSchalke in Gelsenkirchen.\n\nThey then travel to Frankfurt to take on Denmark at Waldstadion on June 20 and face Slovenia on June 25 at the RheinEnergieStadion in Cologne.\n\nAs well as food and drink, there are all the standard bans on items for stadiums - don't be bringing any weapons, pyrotechnics, drones, ladders, laser pointers, or political propaganda with you.\n\nNo Nazi flags, no flags supporting sides in the Israel-Hamas war, no drugs, no stools, and no suitcases.\n\nPunishments include 'expulsion from the stadium with a report to the police or a stadium ban for the whole or part of Euro 2024.'\n\nDisappointingly, there's also a block on vuvuzelas, so don't expect the tournament to evoke many memories of the 2010 South Africa World Cup.\n\nGareth Southgate's side will kick off their Euro 2024 campaign against Serbia on june 16\n\nOn the bright side, Mail Sport understands that Gareth Southgate will be able to take something nice: a 26-man squad.\n\nIt had been anticipated that limits would revert to normal 23-man squads this year, however a vote on Monday at a meeting of the UEFA national competitions committee has given the green-light for 26-player squads.\n\nThe vote does not necessarily translate to a change set in stone - UEFA's executive committee must first sanction a formal alteration to the rule - although it does indicate that 26-player squads might become a regular fixture moving forward.\n\nThe suggestion had originally been raised a fortnight ago in Dusseldorf, Germany at a meeting of national team managers.\n\nUEFA's executive committee are not set to meet for almost a month - May 22 - although this decision could be ratified remotely.\n\nSuch an eventuality could even happen this week, giving the likes of Gareth Southgate and Steve Clarke more notice to start putting together final squads.",

Their disregard for consumers and developers is matched only by their disdain for the law,\" a spokesperson for Spotify said in a statement.\n\nApple said it will approve the new version of the app after Spotify accepts the terms of the Music Streaming Services Entitlement in the European Economic Area (EEA), and resubmit it for review.\n\n\"This entitlement is required even if your app does not include an external link,\" Apple said in a response to Spotify about the app update.\n\nUnder Apple's proposal, Spotify and other streaming services can include links to their websites to inform users of payment options outside its App Store and the company would charge a 27 percent commission on transactions made through a link.\n\nSpotify did not include the in-app link in the update submitted to Apple.\n\nSpotify said it does not want to be a part of Apple's entitlement as it is a new set of anti-steering restrictions and includes the 27 percent commission on digital purchases made through links.\n\n\"We are currently assessing whether Apple has fully complied with the decision,\" a spokesperson for the European Commission said, adding the Commission will also assess any changes implemented by Apple to its App Store business terms under the Digital Markets Act.\n\nIn March, Brussels fined Apple with EUR 1.84 billion ($1.97 billion or roughly Rs. 16,418 crore) for thwarting competition from music streaming rivals via restrictions on its App Store.",

        "text": "Meta*, the social media giant formerly known as Facebook, recently released its first-quarter financial report for 2024. The report reveals a tale of two realities: strong growth in its core advertising business contrasted with persistent losses in its Reality Labs division, focused on virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies.\n\nDespite the challenges in the VR/AR sector, Meta's core business continues to perform well. The company reported over $36.5 billion in revenue for the first quarter, a healthy 27% increase year-over-year. This growth underscores the enduring strength of Meta's advertising platform, which continues to be a significant cash cow for the company.\n\nThis financial resilience provides Meta with the resources necessary to invest heavily in its ambitious VR/AR endeavors, even amidst current losses.\n\nMeta's Reality Labs division, spearheading the company's VR/AR push, paints a more complex picture. On the one hand, the division experienced a 30% revenue growth compared to the same period in 2023, reaching $440 million. This increase suggests a growing interest in Meta's VR hardware, such as the Quest headset.\n\nHowever, the positive revenue trend is overshadowed by significant financial losses. Reality Labs recorded a net loss of $3.85 billion for the quarter, representing a slight improvement compared to the previous year. This translates to a staggering monthly loss exceeding $1 billion.\n\nDespite the financial losses, Meta remains steadfast in its commitment to VR/AR technology. The company's financial report explicitly states its intention to \"significantly increase investment in developing new VR/AR products or expanding the ecosystem.\" This unwavering focus suggests Meta is playing the long game, viewing VR/AR as a transformative technology with the potential to revolutionize how we interact with the digital world.\n\nThere are several factors contributing to Meta's current financial losses in VR/AR:\n\nHigh Development Costs: Developing cutting-edge VR/AR hardware and software is an expensive endeavor. Meta is investing heavily in research and development to create immersive and user-friendly experiences.\n\nLimited Market Penetration: The VR/AR market is still in its nascent stages. Consumer adoption remains relatively low, with a lack of compelling content and high-end hardware prices hindering broader appeal.\n\nCompetition: Meta faces competition from other tech giants like Apple and Google, who are also exploring VR/AR technologies. This competitive landscape can lead to price wars and market fragmentation.\n\nWhy is Meta losing money on VR/AR?\n\nMeta's VR/AR losses stem from high development costs, limited market penetration, and competition.\n\nWill Meta continue to invest in VR/AR despite the losses?\n\nYes, Meta's financial report indicates a strong commitment to VR/AR, with plans for significant future investments.",

Last year, 2.6 million new hybrids were sold in China, about half the number of EVs. Together, they accounted for 36% of the market.\n\nChinese EV maker BYD, known for its low-cost battery technology and cars, is also going after the high-end market in China, defined as 1 million yuan ($140,000) and up.\n\nIts Yangwang brand introduced the latest version of the U8, a monster of an off-road SUV that was launched last September and is designed for survival in rugged conditions. It comes with a satellite phone in case a driver gets stuck beyond cell phone range.\n\nThe U8 is built on a platform that enables it to turn on the spot, like a tank. It's priced at 1.1 million yuan ($150,000). For 100,000 yuan ($13,800) more, buyers can add a built-in drone system.\n\nVolvo, the Swedish brand now under Geely, offered an answer for those overwhelmed by technology.\n\n\"The current EV market is marked by a prevalent trend of excess and addition,\" said Roger Yu, Volvo's managing director for sales in greater China.\n\nHe introduced the EX30 electric SUV as a user-friendly vehicle with a sophisticated sound system and a tablet screen that are both easy to use.\n\n\"By subtracting for ease of use and adding for safety, Volvo aims to give users the clearest interface, the most user-friendly operation, and the most reassuring intelligent experience,\" he said of the in-car screen.\n\nThe company announced that the EX30 would sell in China for 210,000 to 260,000 yuan ($29,000-$36,000).\n\nAssociated Press researcher Yu Bing and video producer Olivia Zhang contributed.",

        "text": "Huawei Technologies Co's latest smartphones carry a version of the advanced made-in-China processor it revealed last year, independent analysis revealed, underscoring the Chinese company's ability to sustain production of the controversial chip.\n\nThe Pura 70 series Huawei unveiled last week sports the Kirin 9010 processor, consultancy TechInsights found in a teardown of the device. That's a newer version of the Kirin 9000s made by Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp for the Mate 60 Pro, which alarmed officials in Washington who thought a 7-nanometre chip beyond China's capabilities.\n\nHuawei has enjoyed a resurgence since the Mate's August debut, riding a wave of celebration around its ability to realise sophisticated semiconductor manufacturing despite escalating US technology export curbs. Its Pura 70 series sold out within two days of their launch, according to market checks conducted by Jefferies analysts led by Edison Lee. US officials are now weighing additional sanctions intended to ring-fence the company and China's semiconductor ambitions more broadly.\n\nTechInsights, which was the first to identify the original 9000s in conjunction with Bloomberg News, said it found \"with high confidence\" that the Pura contained a Huawei Kirin 9010 fabricated using SMIC's so-called 7nm N+2 process, an enhanced version of typical 7nm manufacturing.\n\nFormerly known as the P series, the Pura line has traditionally sold on the strength of their camera capabilities. Giving domestic users a fresh option could apply further pressure on the iPhone, which isn't due for an upgrade until September. Huawei is likely to see further market share gains ahead of the June 18 sales festival, Jefferies said.\n\nFor Huawei, it's another step toward rebuilding a consumer business devastated by Trump-era sanctions. The company was roughly on par with Apple Inc in terms of Chinese market share in the first quarter, underscoring the way it's eroded the iPhone maker's domestic market share in past months.",

        "text": "NEW YORK: At its peak in the early 2000s, Photobucket was the world's top image-hosting site. The media backbone for once-hot services like Myspace and Friendster, it boasted 70 million users and accounted for nearly half of the US online photo market.\n\nToday only two million people still use Photobucket, according to analytics tracker Similarweb. But the generative AI revolution may give it a new lease of life.\n\nCEO Ted Leonard, who runs the 40-strong company out of Edwards, Colorado, told Reuters he is in talks with multiple tech companies to license Photobucket's 13 billion photos and videos to be used to train generative AI models that can produce new content in response to text prompts.\n\nHe has discussed rates of between 5 cents and US$1 per photo and more than US$1 per video, he said, with prices varying widely both by the buyer and the types of imagery sought.\n\n\"We've spoken to companies that have said, 'we need way more',\" Leonard added, with one buyer telling him they wanted over a billion videos, more than his platform has.\n\n\"You scratch your head and say, where do you get that?\"\n\nPhotobucket declined to identify its prospective buyers, citing commercial confidentiality. The ongoing negotiations, which haven't been previously reported, suggest the company could be sitting on billions of dollars' worth of content and give a glimpse into a bustling data market that's arising in the rush to dominate generative AI technology.\n\nTech giants like Google, Meta and Microsoft-backed OpenAI initially used reams of data scraped from the Internet for free to train generative AI models like ChatGPT that can mimic human creativity. They have said that doing so is both legal and ethical, though they face lawsuits from a string of copyright holders over the practice.\n\nAt the same time, these tech companies are also quietly paying for content locked behind paywalls and login screens, giving rise to a hidden trade in everything from chat logs to long forgotten personal photos from faded social media apps.\n\n\"There is a rush right now to go for copyright holders that have private collections of stuff that is not available to be scraped,\" said Edward Klaris from law firm Klaris Law, which says it's advising content owners on deals worth tens of millions of dollars apiece to license archives of photos, movies and books for AI training.\n\nReuters spoke to more than 30 people with knowledge of AI data deals, including current and former executives at companies involved, lawyers and consultants, to provide the first in-depth exploration of this fledgling market - detailing the types of content being bought, the prices materialising, plus emerging concerns about the risk of personal data making its way into AI models without people's knowledge or explicit consent.\n\nOpenAI, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Apple and Amazon all declined to comment on specific data deals and discussions for this article, although Microsoft and Google referred Reuters to supplier codes of conduct that include data-privacy provisions.\n\nGoogle added that it would \"take immediate action, up to and including termination\" of its agreement with a supplier if it discovered a violation.\n\nMany major market research firms say they have not even begun to estimate the size of the opaque AI data market, where companies often don't disclose agreements. Those researchers who do, such as Business Research Insights, put the market at roughly US$2.5bil now and forecast it could grow close to US$30bil within a decade.\n\nGenerative data gold rush\n\nThe data land grab comes as makers of big generative AI \"foundation\" models face increasing pressure to account for the massive amounts of content they feed into their systems, a process known as \"training\" that requires intensive computing power and often takes months to complete.\n\nTech companies say the technology would be cost-prohibitive if they couldn't use vast archives of free scraped web page data, such as those provided by non-profit repository Common Crawl, which they describe as \"publicly available\".\n\nTheir approach has nonetheless drawn a wave of copyright lawsuits and regulatory heat, while prompting publishers to add code to their websites to block scraping.\n\nIn response, AI model makers have started hedging risks and securing data-supply chains, both through deals with content owners and via a burgeoning industry of data brokers that has popped up to satisfy demand.\n\nIn the months after ChatGPT debuted in late 2022, for instance, companies including Meta, Google, Amazon and Apple all struck agreements with stock image provider Shutterstock to use hundreds of millions of images, videos and music files in its library for training, according to a person familiar with the arrangements.\n\nThe deals with Big Tech firms initially ranged from US$25mil to US$50mil each, though most were later expanded, Shutterstock's chief financial officer Jarrod Yahes told Reuters. Smaller tech players have followed suit, spurring a fresh \"flurry of activity\" in the past two months, he added.\n\nYahes declined to comment on individual contracts. The Apple agreement, and the size of the other deals, haven't previously been made public.\n\nA Shutterstock competitor, Freepik, told Reuters it had struck agreements with two large tech companies to license the majority of its archive of 200 million images at 2 to 4 cents per image. There are five more similar deals in the pipeline, said CEO Joaquin Cuenca Abela, declining to identify buyers.\n\nOpenAI, an early Shutterstock customer, has also signed licensing agreements with at least four news organisations, including The Associated Press and Axel Springer. Thomson Reuters, the owner of Reuters News, separately said it has struck deals to license news content to help train AI large language models, but didn't disclose details.\n\n'Ethically sourced' content\n\nAn industry of dedicated AI data firms is emerging too, securing rights to real-world content like podcasts, short-form videos and interactions with digital assistants, while also building networks of short-term contract workers to produce custom visuals and voice samples from scratch, akin to an Uber-esque gig economy for data.\n\nSeattle-based Defined.ai licenses data to a range of companies including Google, Meta, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft, CEO Daniela Braga told Reuters.\n\nRates vary by buyer and content type, but Braga said companies are generally willing to pay US$1 to US$2 per image, US$2 to US$4 per short-form video and US$100 to US$300 per hour of longer films. The market rate for text is US$0.001 per word, she added.\n\nImages of nudity, which require the most sensitive handling, go for US$5 to US$7 , she said.\n\nDefined.ai splits those earnings with content providers, Braga said. It markets its datasets as \"ethically sourced\", as it obtains consent from people whose data it uses and strips out personally identifying information, she added.\n\nOne of the firm's suppliers, a Brazil-based entrepreneur, said he pays owners of the photos, podcasts and medical data he sources about 20% to 30% of total deal amounts.\n\nThe priciest images in his portfolio are those used to train AI systems that block content like graphic violence barred by the tech companies, said the supplier, who spoke on condition his company wasn't identified, citing commercial sensitivity.\n\nTo fulfill those requests, he obtains images of crime scenes, conflict violence and surgeries - mainly from police, freelance photojournalists and medical students, respectively - often in places in South America and Africa where distributing graphic images is more common, he said.\n\nHe said he has received images from freelance photographers in Gaza since the start of the war there in October, plus some from Israel at the outset of hostilities.\n\nHis company hires nurses accustomed to seeing violent injuries to anonymise and annotate the images, which are disturbing to untrained eyes, he added.\n\n'I would find it risky'\n\nWhile licensing could resolve some legal and ethical issues, resurrecting the archives of old Internet names like Photobucket as fuel for the latest AI models raises others, particularly around user privacy, according to many of the industry players interviewed.\n\nAI systems have been caught regurgitating exact copies of their training data, spitting out, for example, the Getty Images watermark, verbatim paragraphs of New York Times articles and images of real people. That means a person's private photos or intimate thoughts posted decades ago could potentially wind up in generative AI outputs without notice or explicit consent.\n\nPhotobucket CEO Leonard says he is on solid legal ground, citing an update to the company's terms of service in October that grants it the \"unrestricted right\" to sell any uploaded content for the purpose of training AI systems. He sees licensing data as an alternative to selling ads.\n\n\"We need to pay our bills, and this could give us the ability to continue to support free accounts,\" he said.\n\nDefined.ai's Braga said she avoids acquiring content from \"platform\" companies like Photobucket and prefers to source social media photos from influencers who create them, who she said have a clearer claim to licensing rights.\n\n\"I would find it very risky,\" Braga said of platform content. \"If there's some AI that generates something that resembles a picture of someone who never approved that, that's a problem.\"\n\nPhotobucket is not alone among platforms in embracing licensing. Tumblr's parent company Automattic said last month it was sharing content with \"select AI companies\". In February, Reuters reported Reddit struck a deal with Google to make its content available for training the latter's AI models.\n\nAhead of its initial public offering in March, Reddit disclosed that its data-licensing business is the subject of a US Federal Trade Commission inquiry and acknowledged it could fall foul of evolving privacy and intellectual-property regulations.\n\nThe FTC, which warned businesses in February against retroactively changing terms of service for AI usage, declined to comment on the Reddit inquiry or say whether it was looking into other training data deals.\n\n- Reuters",

The government aims to pass the bill during the current Diet session. If approved, the bill is expected to be fully implemented by the end of 2025.\n\nThe envisaged new law establishes various prohibitions and obligations for app store operators to promote the competition of smartphone software. The law aims to prohibit Google from prioritizing its products and services in its search results and open up Apple's App Store to other companies, among other things.\n\nIf a company violates the envisaged law, the Fair Trade Commission (FTC) will impose a fine worth 20% of domestic sales in the relevant field. The monetary penalty is a significant increase from the current fine set at 6% under the Antimonopoly Law. The goal is to force the two IT giants to comply with regulations.\n\nWith the smartphone operating system market dominated by Apple's iOS and Google's Android, the various restrictions imposed by the two IT giants on app distributors and other companies have become an issue.\n\nSome observers say the lack of competition has led to high fees paid by consumers. \"The bill will create a competitive environment to expand consumer choice by stimulating innovation of areas such as the app stores,\" said consumer affairs minister Hanako Jimi, who is in charge of the commission, at a press conference after the Cabinet meeting Friday.\n\nOther provisions in the new bill include the prohibition on unfair and discriminatory treatment of app distributors. It also prohibits app store operators from using acquired data for services that compete with app distributors.\n\nIT giants will be required to submit annual regulatory compliance reports, and the commission is to monitor them to ensure that they are complying with the regulations.",

        "text": "As YouTube becomes a hotbed for podcast audiences, particularly first-time and younger listeners, the platform is seeking to become a more \"eyes optional\" experience. YouTube Chief Product Officer Johanna Voolich described the shift of ideals in a recent conversation.\n\nThe chat on YouTube's Creator Insider uses Murder, Mystery and Makeup, a creative podcast that merges true crime storytelling with makeup tutorials, as an example. This dual engagement model capitalizes on YouTube's strength as a visual platform and demonstrates its effectiveness in maintaining viewer engagement, while also being double-faceted content that can be enjoyed without video.\n\nVoolich explains how YouTube is tapping into traditional, audio-only podcast experience through its YouTube Music app, which has been optimized to better support high-quality, production-rich podcast content after the sunsetting of Google Podcasts. This perspective acknowledges that while podcasts are traditionally audio-centric, the addition of visual elements can significantly enhance the listener's experience.\n\nYouTube's algorithm is also heavily at work here, recommending shows with the same learning AI that they use to keep people on the site to watch related and tailored videos.\n\nAnother AI initiative is to change how audio-only content can be presented. In response to a question about supporting older podcast formats on the platform, Voolich revealed that while YouTube currently allows audio-only uploads with static images, there is ongoing consideration for employing AI to create dynamic visualizations for such content.\n\nLast year, Cumulus Media and Signal Hill Insights reported YouTube has overtaken Spotify and Apple as the leading platform for podcast consumption in the US. 608 weekly podcast listeners indicated the platform's robust search capabilities make it a favorite for podcast discovery, especially among heavy users and newcomers.\n\nWhile 14% of weekly podcast listeners now exclusively watch video podcasts on YouTube, the platform's diverse device usage extends beyond smartphones to laptops and TVs. Despite its popularity, YouTube could face challenges in retaining listeners, as many express willingness to switch platforms for exclusive content.",

        "text": "Of course, I understand that many podcasters want to make money (although that was not the original philosophy of the Podcast). Jordi Wild, or Nadie Sabe Nada, are very prone to sneaking advertisements into the program itself. And these sponsored spaces don't bother you, they are their way of making money. Except for a daily podcast that I listened to, lasting between 5 and 10 minutes, of which 3 were advertising space, and obviously I radically cut ties with it.\n\nWhat is a shame is that, despite paying for the Spotify family plan, of almost 20 euros per month, you have to listen to advertising banners embedded by Spotify itself (with permission, of course, from the podcasters).\n\nI'm talking about the typical ads that, if you've ever listened to Spotify Free, sneak in between songs. Well, with podcasts, they do it before and during the broadcast. If you are going to listen to several episodes in a row, also later. As with television, if I want advertising I turn on the radio, but not a program, on demand, for which I also pay.\n\nI've been looking for a solution for a long time, and each one is worse than the last. Ivoox is destroying the market with massive advertising, and limited chapters, in order to make you pay their fee. And it's better not to talk about other platforms, like Podimo or Podium, which are even worse at turning podcasts into something \"luxury\" that, behind a paywall, you either pay for or you can't listen to. Spoiler: all the podcasts that have opted for this platform have failed. There are many other apps for listening to podcasts, but they all have the same purpose: to get your money.\n\nApple Podcast is one of the best options we can have. The problem? That the app is only available for iOS. Google Podcast was another of the best. And I say \"was\" because Google, of course, also wants to take advantage of this and has decided to close its service to include it in Google Play Music, and, therefore, become just another \"Spotify\".\n\nSo what are we left with? Just one name: Audiobookshelf. It is a multimedia server, completely free and open source, which we can host on our computer, NAS, mobile phone, server, or wherever we want, and which allows us to add all the podcasts we want. Of course, true to its name, it also works with audiobooks. But I better leave that melon for another day...\n\nOnce this program is launched, we can add the podcasts we want through their name, or through their RSS feed. Also, even if we download a podcast by hand, in MP3, from other platforms, we can add it by hand.\n\nOnce added, Audiobookshelf takes care of downloading new episodes when they are available, so that when we want to listen to it, we have them ready. We can listen directly in streaming from our PC, NAS or server, or download the episodes to our mobile phone and listen offline.\n\nIt has a very simple and intuitive app that we can use to add all our podcasts, and even organize them however we want. It has backup copies, downloads covers and metadata, and most importantly: advertising free. Obviously, if the podcaster does a sponsored space within the program you will have to listen to it, it is clear. After all, it's what feeds him, and it's understandable. But, thanks to this platform, we will be able to say goodbye to the ABUSE of Spotify, Ivoox, and other similar platforms that are destroying the concept of what a podcast was.",

        "text": "The Apple Vision Pro is apparently experiencing a phase of low popularity. This is deduced from several headlines that can be found in the media, and above all, in the comments on social networks.\n\nIt all started with a statement from Ming-Chi Kuo, who alleged that Apple would have reduced its sales forecast. Then, a executive of marketing I would have left the company after finishing his work with the Apple Vision Pro. There is a lot to analyze, especially since there are some gaps and lack of information. Therefore, let's try to clarify it.\n\nAccording to Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple would have reduced its sales forecast from 700,000 units in 2024 to finally 400,000. This supposes a 40% decrease in targetsso it is understandable that the media and people are worried.\n\nHowever, it was Ming-Chi Kuo himself who stated in February that Apple's proposed goal for the Apple Vision Pro was sell 200,000 units in all of 2024. The surprise was that those 200,000 units were the ones that were sold in reservations and the first weeks after its launch. Therefore, Apple would have exceeded its expectations.\n\nAdditionally, in the month of January, Ming-Chi Kuo also stated that the Apple's goal in all of 2024 was 500,000 unitssince the manufacturer of the screens, Sony, could not assume a higher manufacturing rate due to their complexity.\n\nAs you can see, there is a lot of contradictory data, but there are two that contradict this latest rumor of reduced expectations. Of course, all of this data is provided by Ming-Chi Kuo and his anonymous sourcesnot by Apple directly.\n\nA poor translation of the word \"retired\" in English has led to many Apple media outlets giving it a negative approach to the departure of Frank Casanovauntil now the head of marketing for the Apple Vision Pro. For 36 years, Frank has been within Apple in various roles and with one final big assignment: to make the Apple Vision Pro an object of desire for many of us.\n\nDefinitely, He has had an exciting last stage at Applewhich began with the first Macs. It saw the birth of the first personal computers and is now retiring after starting the era of space computers.\n\nWe have to keep in mind that the Apple Vision Pro is in its first generation, and in fact, there is still a long way to go to see the Apple Vision Pro 2. Practically three months have passed since its launch and the good news is that recently very important applications have arrived.\n\nFirst, we have Unreal Enginethe graphics engine for video games as impressive as Resident Evil IV. Unreal Engine is now compatible with Apple Vision Pro to provide immersive content.\n\nThen the platform Unity also just arrived in the Apple Vision Pro, allowing developers to have three types of experiences at their fingertips: create mixed realities, 2D windows that the user can resize and position like a normal App, and finally, immersive video games.\n\nThe Apple Vision Pro has just started and has had a reception by very committed developers. Imagine what could happen in a year or two when all these companies and those yet to come have their applications and games ready on the Apple Vision Pro.\n\nApple is in no hurry, Apple wants a complete ecosystem and seamless as we are accustomed to. Even overcoming those \"holes\" you have had and has the Mac with the video game sector. Apple wants everything to be perfect for when it reaches the mass public and leaves the United States.",

        "text": "A U.S. Federal Reserve meeting and Apple and Amazon reporting results will keep investors' focus in the days ahead on the global rates outlook and on tech earnings, while growth and inflation data from Europe and China are also coming out.\n\nHere's what to expect in the coming days:\n\nHints of whether the Fed still expects interest rate cuts at some point this year takes center-stage for investors at the central bank's meeting that concludes on Wednesday.\n\nRate action is unlikely, but comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell about the potential for policy easing later in 2024 will be scrutinized.\n\nIn March, the Fed projected three rate cuts this year but stronger-than-expected inflation reports are casting doubt on whether it will be able to ease policy that much - and that soon.\n\nA ratcheting down of rate cut expectations has been a key factor behind the rise in Treasury yields and recent pullback in stocks. Fed futures markets now predict some 35 bps of easing in 2024 down from 150 bps expected at the start of the year.\n\nThe last of the \"Magnificent Seven\" megacaps that drove a fiery stock rally in 2023 to report are Amazon, reporting Tuesday, and Apple, on Thursday.\n\nSome of their peers such as Tesla and Facebook parent Meta Platforms have given a mixed performance.\n\nApple shares have lost their luster in 2024, tumbling over 10%. The iPhone maker is expected to post a decline in first quarter earnings after China smartphone shipments fell 19%.\n\nAmazon's cloud computing business will be in focus while investors will be attuned to the online retailing giant's view of consumer spending. Its shares are faring better so far this year, having risen 18% as of Wednesday.\n\nMeanwhile, tech regulation is also on the front burner. President Joe Biden just signed legislation that bans TikTok in the United States if Chinese owner ByteDance fails to divest the short video app over the next nine months to a year.\n\nFollowing last month's upside surprises on manufacturing activity in China, April's readings are set to indicate whether the long-awaited economic recovery is indeed gathering steam.\n\nOfficial figures for China's purchasing managers' index (PMI) are due on Tuesday and the Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI survey is expected shortly afterwards.\n\nUpbeat data could revive animal spirits in the world's second largest economy, bringing relief to policymakers who have been trying to shore up growth and bolster investor sentiment.\n\nGlobal investment houses have turned increasingly bullish on Chinese stocks, helping the blue-chip index tack on more than 10% from a February trough.\n\nBut Beijing has lately found itself in a bind over its currency. The yuan is sliding against a perky dollar but is stronger against its major trading partners - an unwelcome sign for China's export-reliant economy.\n\nEuro zone inflation and economic growth data due out on Tuesday could strengthen market bets for the European Central Bank to lower its deposit rate from a record 4% in June, although policy makers are not expected to move very fast thereafter.\n\nGross domestic product in the euro zone currency bloc probably expanded by just 0.1% in the first quarter, year-on-year, economists polled by Reuters expect the data to show.\n\nApril inflation numbers could also convince the ECB it's time to cut, after consumer price growth slowed unexpectedly to 2.4% in March and policymakers signaled that the central bank was willing to move.\n\nBut with U.S. inflation running hot and the Fed viewed as likely to hold rates high, markets price 60 bps of cuts by the ECB this year as it remains wary of the euro weakening too much against a supercharged dollar.\n\nConventional wisdom has it that May is the ideal point to take profit on equities and lay low until later in the year.\n\n\"Sell in May and go away\" is based on the premise that the best six-month period for stock market returns is November to April, while the leanest is May to October. Over the last 50 years, the S&P 500 has gained an average of 4.8% between November and April, and just 1.2% between May and October, according to Reuters calculations.\n\nHowever, this pattern fades over a shorter time-frame.\n\nOver the last 20 years, the out-performance of November-April over May-October narrows to 1%. Over 10 years, November-April has underperformed May-October by 1 percentage point and over the last five years, it has underperformed by 3 percentage points.\n\nIt might be time to find words that rhyme with \"November.\"",

        "text": "Filtering out noise and disregarding short-term headlines are among the hardest challenges facing investors, but it's where the noise is loudest that skilled fund managers see opportunities instead of pitfalls.\n\nOne example of a good investment case undermined by an unhelpful narrative is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), according to Paul Flood, co-manager of the £2.2bn BNY Mellon Multi-Asset Growth portfolio.\n\nInvesting in China and Taiwan is perceived as particularly risky due to geopolitical tensions in the region, but at the beginning of this year, Flood went against the grain and added to TSMC exactly at peak noise, which he identified as a good entry point.\n\n\"During the Taiwanese elections [in January 2024], the narrative around China invading Taiwan led to an opportunity as the valuation came back by a long way,\" he said.\n\n\"While we are paying 30 times earnings for high-growth US technology companies, we can pick TSMC up for low-to-mid-teens multiples and we're buying a company that creates most semiconductors that we find in all our products.\"\n\nThe fund's weighting to the company went from 1.3% at the end of 2023 to 1.9% as at the end of February 2024, with the position then being worth £41.3m. Since the beginning of the year, the stock has grown 32%.\n\nPerformance of stock over the year to date\n\nSource: Google Finance\n\nFrom Flood's risk/reward perspective, the scale is still tilted in favour of TSMC.\n\nApproximately 90% of the world's high-end semiconductor content is made in Taiwan. If geopolitical events cut off access to Taiwan's advanced chips, everything from electric vehicles (EVs) to hedge trimmers would be impacted, as the scarcity at the high-end of the market would trickle down through the whole supply chain, including to lower-quality chips.\n\n\"If China does invade Taiwan, TSMC is going to be the least of our problems, it will impact all other companies that we invest in on a global basis,\" he said.\n\n\"If you can't get semiconductor content, how are you going to build things? Apple won't be able to build mobile phones, Microsoft isn't going to build out the cloud, and Volkswagen will stop making cars. Semiconductor content powers the world.\"\n\nTaiwan's flagship also stands to benefit from competition between the great powers to ensure the security of semiconductor supply.\n\n\"TSMC has tax benefits and subsidies around the world as the US, Japan and Europe need to power everything from EVs but also the military side of things as well,\" he noted.\n\nEarlier this month, the US government announced a $6.6bn grant to help TSMC build three factories in Arizona.\n\nAnother area where Flood is poised to take advantage of market noise is the US, particularly around the upcoming elections and the future of the Inflation Reduction Act, with its subsidies for US industry.\n\n\"We've seen a lot of noise about reducing or getting rid of the Inflation Reduction Act and there's a lot of being said about the differences between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, but there are also a lot of similarities,\" he said.\n\n\"For example, they are both big spenders, so we don't think that the outcome of the election will change the fiscal debate in the short term. The same capital and the same spending would just be allocated somewhere else.

        "text": "Apple's favorite older display works with newer Macs only with a Thunderbolt port.\n\nApple made its popular Apple Thunderbolt Display from 2011 to 2016-we still get questions about using the display eight years after it was discontinued. Even though the Thunderbolt Display used an older Thunderbolt standard, it remained compatible with Thunderbolt 3 when that newer standard was released, as well as with the even fresher Thunderbolt 4.\n\nThe Apple Thunderbolt Display offered a Thunderbolt 2 data connection via a jack that is identical in appearance to Mini DisplayPort. Thunderbolt 3 requires USB-C, a standard that can connect devices and computers using Thunderbolt 3/4, USB 3.1 and later, and USB4. USB-C is a specification for ports, jacks, and cables; Thunderbolt and USB's numbered standards define what flows over those connections. (There were some tweaky elements of using Mini DisplayPort and Thunderbolt 2 when Apple transitioned from the former to the latter, but none of that is relevant with USB-C or Thunderbolt 3/4.)\n\nIf you want to use a Thunderbolt Display, most people rely on Apple's Thunderbolt 2 to 3 adapter, for which Apple still charges a whopping $49. This adapter has a USB-C jack on one end, and you can only get the display to work if it's plugged into a Thunderbolt 3 or 4 port on your Mac or an external Thunderbolt dock.\n\nPlug it into a USB 3.x/USB4 port on an external dock or a USB 3.x/USB4-only port on certain Macs (like the lower-end Mac Studio models' front two ports) and the display doesn't function.\n\nThe reason is convoluted. The display relies on DisplayPort data coming from the computer to show the screen. However, even though USB 3.x/USB4 support passing through DisplayPort data, the hardware on the Apple Thunderbolt Display can't interpret that -- it only has a chip that can accept Thunderbolt-encoded information, including the method by which DisplayPort is wrapped up for Thunderbolt.\n\nIt's one of the remaining cases where USB-C frustrates an average user with a mix of older and newer gear. The telltale is the lightning bolt symbol on Apple's adapter: there's a Thunderbolt lightning bolt on both the input side (for Thunderbolt 2) and output (for Thunderbolt 3/4). The USB logo is entirely different and absent.\n\nLearn more about connecting older Apple displays to a Mac.\n\nThis Mac 911 article is in response to a question submitted by Macworld reader Mike.\n\nWe've compiled a list of the questions we get asked most frequently, along with answers and links to columns: read our super FAQ to see if your question is covered.

        "text": "[You can listen to this episode of \"The Ezra Klein Show\" on the NYT Audio App, Apple, Spotify, Amazon Music, Google or wherever you get your podcasts.]\n\nI feel as if I've always known who Salman Rushdie is. He sat in my consciousness as the author of this eerie-sounding novel called \"The Satanic Verses,\" a novel so somehow dangerous, he had to go into hiding after Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the supreme leader of Iran, said Rushdie and anyone involved in its publication should be killed for blaspheming Islam.\n\nIn August of 2022, more than 30 years after the fatwa, a fanatic with a knife attacked and tried to kill Rushdie. He survived, though he lost an eye. His latest book, \"Knife: Meditations After an Attempted Murder,\" is about the attack and its aftermath. But it's also about his life. It's about his marriage. It's about his children. And it's about the invention of other versions of him that became more real in the world than he was, other versions of him that almost got him killed.\n\nThis is what I now understand after reading \"Knife,\" what I now understand after I went and read, for the first time, \"The Satanic Verses\": I have never known who Salman Rushdie is. And maybe not just him. How many people out there do I wrongly think that I know?\n\nRushdie and I talked for an episode of my podcast. This is an edited transcript of our conversation.\n\nEzra Klein: I want to begin with a story you mention a little bit offhandedly in the book: \"The Shadow\" by Hans Christian Andersen.",

        "text": "Here's what readers are saying in Friday's letters to the editor.\n\nSome continually agitate for \"market demand\" to be the chief consideration in higher curriculum. They have been at it for years now, pushing bean counters' notions of the classical western liberal arts education that Gov. Ron DeSantis and others say they want, but really don't. Through history, adept and eager students would travel to distant universities to study with the widely known, best minds in their fields. Generally, those weren't accounting or marketing classes. Some recent letters to the editor reminded me of University of South Florida professors I had 40 years ago. One, an English lit professor, was a frail old Englishman, white as an egg, with a brutalized, ratty, gamey cardigan sweater, the elbows worn through. He had a brown stain in his white beard from his pipe, which had an ever-present and long thread of drool swinging from its bowl. He began every class with some verse from one of the Romantic poets, or Kipling. I'm sure he held forth just as readily with no audience at all. He was a treasure, but bean counters would not have approved. At 22, I realized I'd learned nothing of Africa or its colonization by Europe by that age, so I took two courses on the subject from a wonderful professor, a small Igbo man from Nigeria, educated in English schools there. He spoke with a beautiful clipped accent, had a wonderful mind, was bemused by the United States, and he opened a new and wonderful part of the world to me. Again, bean counters wouldn't have approved.\n\nIf old growth trees are valuable to a home sale, why are developers razing old growth trees? This is in context to an old home on a double lot bought a few months ago by a developer just a block from my home in Childs Park. They tore down the house (expected) -- and took out every single tree on that property. It was quite shocking to see the latter happen. That experience inspired me to wonder how we can get developers to value old growth trees. I never like to look to the government -- or more regulation -- to save us. I love to look at the market (that is, ourselves) to save us. So how do we (the market's \"demand\") express that we value old growth trees? How do we make it so developers (the market's \"supply\") start preserving and valuing these old growth trees? After musing over these questions the past months, I was so shocked to see a listing for the new house a block from my home pop up on Zillow. The house now sits on a sandy, concrete lot, but for sales purposes, it's imagined in a rendering as surrounded by lush old growth trees that the developer cut down to build this very home.\n\nI had the privilege of a visit to several European countries a while back and was mildly shocked and pleasantly surprised when a waiter told me that tips are appreciated, but not expected since servers are paid a salary. This is something our country has generally resisted vehemently, claiming it would raise prices for customers. Well, seems to me it would balance out. The diner would save by not tipping, but pay more for the meal. I was a server, in my younger days. I know what it is to hope customers will come in, hope the cooks make an enjoyable meal and hope the customers like you. Our eateries need to treat their wait staff with the respect of a living wage and not like a dog begging for a bone.\n\nI write to express deep concern regarding President Joe Biden's public support for abortion, which starkly contradicts the Catholic Church's teachings on the sanctity of life. Notably, the president made the sign of the cross in Tampa this week where he gave a speech in favor of abortion rights. This occurred within the Diocese of St. Petersburg, headed by Bishop Gregory Parkes, and was a gesture that has profound implications given the setting and his influential position.\n\nThe church teaches that abortion is a grave moral wrong. Canon law reserves excommunication for severe acts that threaten the church's integrity and mislead the faithful. The president's actions, particularly within the Diocese of St. Petersburg, arguably warrant such a response, not as a punitive measure but as a call to repentance and realignment with church doctrine. The bishop has the authority and the duty to address this significant pastoral challenge. The faithful look to him for guidance when prominent Catholics publicly challenge our core beliefs. This is a moment for decisive action that reaffirms the church's stance on life and aids the president's spiritual journey through the stark reminder of his obligations as a Catholic.\n\nWhy is it so taboo to bring up the delicate subject of extracting a phone from a student while in school? Cellphones and smartphones are primarily used as a social communication tool to share opinions, photos (mostly different profiles of the same individual), and to text and check on one's real time tracking of how well they are liked at any particular moment.\n\nWith all of the tasks required to monitor, share and respond, it's unlikely that full focus on anything can realistically happen. Multitasking is a myth, and it's disproven daily by contributing to auto and pedestrian accidents, bumping into someone or something while walking, or responding with the proverbial \"what did you say?\" when making an attempt to be human while passing one another.\n\nWhen cellphones started in the marketplace and became affordable for many, parents typically supported them as a tool for safety. As time went on and the Blackberry trended as the status symbol for students, it was to save the child from social embarrassment, no longer just a tool for safety.\n\nToday, it's boiled down to Android and Apple, with pretty much all the ability of a laptop computer with a primary function of keeping the user socially connected full time. With proof that no one has the ability to focus on two tasks concurrently, keeping phones locked up while a student is in school is a no brainer. If it's imperative that a parent contact their child while in class, just call the school.\n\nCompare the cellphone to a laptop or tablet. All three are tools of our modern era. Proper training on how to use each appropriately is needed. Parental and school guidance and oversight is also needed to properly guide youth in the proper use of the device. Let's face it, there are a lot of questionable apps out there, and proper use of the device in school should contribute to learning or be there for emergencies. We need to accept that this technology is here to stay and proper use of it is more important training than trying to restrict it.\n\nAssuming Rich Logis' transformation is for real, there are many of us who did not need to go through such a transformation in the first place.",

Here are more ceremonies coming up.\n\nSaturday, May 18\n\n10 a.m. Early College High School\n\n1 p.m. Cabarrus Early College of Technology\n\nThese ceremonies will be held at West Cabarrus High School.\n\nThe first graduation of the season will be for Cabarrus College of Health Science. Those festivities will be Saturday, May 4, at the Atrium Health Ball Park.\n\nRowan-Cabarrus Community College will have its graduation at Cabarrus Arena on Friday, May 17.\n\nA.L. Brown High School (Kannapolis City Schools) is set to have graduation on Saturday, May 25.\n\nNo. 5\n\nCannon School is hopping. A new Head of School was named a few days ago. It's Michael Drew. We'll tell you more about him in the Sunday edition. Coming up Saturday at Cannon will be the annual arts festival called Arts Jam.\n\nCannon's graduation is set. Laura Huffman will be delivering the commencement address. School leaders said with her inspiring presence since 2006, Laura has touched the lives of countless graduates. Graduation will be Friday, May 24, at 9 a.m. on Bryant Central Green.\n\nOur friend Bill Diskin shared a couple of numbers with us this week. Cannon has its highest enrollment ever at 1,047 students and the target number for August and the new school year is 1,056.\n\nNo. 5A\n\nRoad work approved for Cabarrus County roads. A $2.3 million contract awarded by the N.C. Department of Transportation this month will bring improvements to nearly nine miles of roads in Cabarrus County.\n\nContractor NJR Group, Inc. of Albemarle will perform the improvements, including milling, resurfacing, shoulder reconstruction, full depth reclamation, and pavement markings. Roads included in the contract are:\n\nWeddington Road from south of George Liles Parkway to north of Pitts School Road\n\nRimer Road from the Rowan County line to Gold Hill Road\n\nBerkeley Place from Harris Road to the cul de sac\n\nWork can start as soon as May 20 with completion scheduled for fall 2025.\n\nThese projects should make the ride a little smoother but won't do anything to improve that wicked curve at the top of the hill on Weddington Road. I know the neighbors can't believe NCDOT and Concord officials won't do anything to make that a safer stretch of road. Or that motorists won't slow down.\n\nYou know I always complain about the lines on the street fading out and particularly on Supercenter Drive off Roxie Street at NorthLite. I noticed the other day that the street sign has a yellow \"PRI\" tag, which means its a private street. I don't know if it's new or I just noticed it, but what it does mean is that the developer/shopping center owner is responsible for that street.\n\nIf you have a Friday Five, story suggestion or something I can rant about, email mplemmons@independenttribune.com or call or text 704-786-0001.

This is a follow-up to the Kirin 9000s made by Semiconductor Manufacturing International (OTCQX:SIUIF) for the Mate 60 Pro, the report added.\n\nLast month, it was reported that Semiconductor Manufacturing International used gear from Applied Materials (AMAT) and Lam Research (LRCX) to make an advanced 7-nanometer chip for Huawei last year.\n\nHuawei surprised many in August 2023 by quietly launching its new flagship smartphone, Mate 60 Pro. The chip inside the phone ignited concerns in the U.S. and raised questions about how it was possible, without the company being able to access critical technologies. The phone also prompted an evaluation by the U.S. to learn the details of the chip inside, which was the most advanced semiconductor China had manufactured.\n\nTechInsights noted that it found \"with high confidence\" that the Pura smartphone featured a Huawei Kirin 9010 processor fabricated using Semiconductor Manufacturing International's so-called 7nm N+2 process, an enhanced version of typical 7nm manufacturing.\n\nHuawei was once in competition with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung (OTCPK:SSNLF) to be the world's biggest handset maker until U.S. restrictions, starting in 2019, began to curb its access to chip manufacturing tools needed to produce its most advanced models.\n\nHowever, the Chinese company has been gaining ground. Apple slipped to the third spot in China's smartphone market as local rivals Honor and Huawei were tied for the first place in the first quarter of 2024, according to research firm International Data Corporation.\n\nApple's smartphone shipments in China tumbled 19% in the first quarter of this year, data from Counterpoint Research showed. It was the phone's worst performance in China since COVID hit around 2020.",

        "text": "With little pomp, California launched two apps at the start of the year offering free behavioral health services to youths to help them cope with everything from living with anxiety to body acceptance.\n\nThrough their phones, young people and some caregivers can meet BrightLife Kids and Soluna coaches, some who specialize in peer support or substance use disorders, for roughly 30-minute virtual counseling sessions that are best suited to those with more mild needs, typically those without a clinical diagnosis. The apps also feature self-directed activities, such as white noise sessions, guided breathing, and videos of ocean waves to help users relax.\n\n\"We believe they're going to have not just great impact, but wide impact across California, especially in places where maybe it's not so easy to find an in-person behavioral health visit or the kind of coaching and supports that parents and young people need,\" said Gov. Gavin Newsom's health secretary, Mark Ghaly, during the Jan. 16 announcement.\n\nThe apps represent one of the Democratic governor's major forays into health technology and come with four-year contracts valued at $498 million. California is believed to be the first state to offer a mental health app with free coaching to all young residents, according to the Department of Health Care Services, which operates the program.\n\nHowever, the rollout has been slow. So slow that one of the companies has missed a deadline to make its app available on Android phones. Only about 15,000 of the state's 12.6 million children and young adults have signed up for the apps, and school counselors say they've never heard of them.\n\nAdvocates for youth question the wisdom of investing taxpayer dollars in two private companies. Social workers are concerned the companies' coaches won't properly identify youths who need referrals for clinical care. And the spending is drawing lawmaker scrutiny amid a state deficit pegged at as much as $73 billion.\n\nAn App for That\n\nNewsom's administration says the apps fill a need for young Californians and their families to access professional telehealth for free, in multiple languages, and outside of standard 9-to-5 hours. It's part of Newsom's sweeping $4.7 billion master plan for kids' mental health, which was introduced in 2022 to increase access to mental health and substance use support services. In addition to launching virtual tools such as the teletherapy apps, the initiative is working to expand workforce capacity, especially in underserved areas.\n\n\"The reality is that we are rarely 6 feet away from our devices,\" said Sohil Sud, director of Newsom's Children and Youth Behavioral Health Initiative. \"The question is how we can leverage technology as a resource for all California youth and families, not in place of, but in addition to, other behavioral health services that are being developed and expanded.\"\n\nThe virtual platforms come amid rising depression and suicide rates among youth and a shortage of mental health providers. Nearly half of California youths from the ages of 12 to 17 report having recently struggled with mental health issues, with nearly a third experiencing serious psychological distress, according to a 2021 study by the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research. These rates are even higher for multiracial youths and those from low-income families.\n\nBut those supporting youth mental health at the local level question whether the apps will move the needle on climbing depression and suicide rates.\n\n\"It's fair to applaud the state of California for aggressively seeking new tools,\" said Alex Briscoe of California Children's Trust, a statewide initiative that, along with more than 100 local partners, works to improve the social and emotional health of children. \"We just don't see it as fundamental. And we don't believe the youth mental health crisis will be solved by technology projects built by a professional class who don't share the lived experience of marginalized communities.\"\n\nThe apps, BrightLife Kids and Soluna, are operated by two companies: Brightline, a 5-year-old venture capital-backed startup; and Kooth, a London-based publicly traded company that has experience in the U.K. and has also signed on some schools in Kentucky and Pennsylvania and a health plan in Illinois. In the first five months of Kooth's Pennsylvania pilot, 6% of students who had access to the app signed up.\n\nBrightline and Kooth represent a growing number of health tech firms seeking to profit in this space. They beat out dozens of other bidders including international consulting companies and other youth telehealth platforms that had already snapped up contracts in California.\n\nAlthough the service is intended to be free with no insurance requirement, Brightline's app, BrightLife Kids, is folded into and only accessible through the company's main app, which asks for insurance information and directs users to paid licensed counseling options alongside the free coaching. After KFF Health News questioned why the free coaching was advertised below paid options, Brightline reordered the page so that, even if a child has high-acuity needs, free coaching shows up first.\n\nThe apps take an expansive view of behavioral health, making the tools available to all California youth under age 26 as well as caregivers of babies, toddlers, and children 12 and under. When KFF Health News asked to speak with an app user, Brightline connected a reporter with a mother whose 3-year-old daughter was learning to sleep on her own.\n\n'It's Like Crickets'\n\nDespite being months into the launch and having millions in marketing funds, the companies don't have a definitive rollout timeline. Brightline said it hopes to have deployed teams across the state to present the tools in person by midyear. Kooth said developing a strategy to hit every school would be \"the main focus for this calendar year.\"\n\n\"It's a big state -- 58 counties,\" Bob McCullough of Kooth said. \"It'll take us a while to get to all of them.\"\n\nBrightline's contract states that the company was required to launch downloadable apps for iOS and Android phones by January, but so far BrightLife Kids is available only on Apple phones. Brightline said it's aiming to launch the Android version over the summer.\n\n\"Nobody's really done anything like this at this magnitude, I think, in the U.S. before,\" said Naomi Allen, a co-founder and the CEO of Brightline. \"We're very much in the early innings. We're already learning a lot.\"\n\nThe contracts, obtained by KFF Health News through a records request, show the companies operating the two apps could earn as much as $498 million through the contract term, which ends in June 2027, months after Newsom is set to leave office. And the state is spending hundreds of millions more on Newsom's virtual behavioral health strategy. The state said it aims to make the apps available long-term, depending on usage.\n\nThe state said 15,000 people signed up in the first three months. When KFF Health News asked how many of those users actively engaged with the app, it declined to say, noting that data would be released this summer.\n\nKFF Health News reached out to nearly a dozen California mental health professionals and youths. None of them were aware of the apps.\n\n\"I'm not hearing anything,\" said Loretta Whitson, executive director of the California Association of School Counselors. \"It's like crickets.\"\n\nWhitson said she doesn't think the apps are on \"anyone's\" radar in schools, and she doesn't know of any schools that are actively advertising them. Brightline will be presenting its tool to the counselor association in May, but Whitson said the company didn't reach out to plan the meeting; she did.\n\nConcern Over Referrals\n\nWhitson isn't comfortable promoting the apps just yet. Although both companies said they have a clinical team on staff to assist, Whitson said she's concerned that the coaches, who aren't all licensed therapists, won't have the training to detect when users need more help and refer them to clinical care.\n\nThis sentiment was echoed by other school-based social workers, who also noted the apps' duplicative nature -- in some counties, like Los Angeles, youths can access free virtual counseling sessions through Hazel Health, a for-profit company. Nonprofits, too, have entered this space. For example, Teen Line, a peer-to-peer hotline operated by Southern California-based Didi Hirsch Mental Health Services, is free nationwide.\n\nWhile the state is also funneling money to the schools as part of Newsom's master plan, students and school-based mental health professionals voiced confusion at the large app investment when, in many school districts, few in-person counseling roles exist, and in some cases are dwindling.\n\nKelly Merchant, a student at College of the Desert in Palm Desert, noted that it can be hard to access in-person therapy at her school. She believes the community college, which has about 15,000 students, has only one full-time counselor and one part-time bilingual counselor. She and several students interviewed by KFF Health News said they appreciated having engaging content on their phone and the ability to speak to a coach, but all said they'd prefer in-person therapy.\n\n\"There are a lot of people who are seeking therapy, and people close to me that I know. But their insurances are taking forever, and they're on the waitlist,\" Merchant said. \"And, like, you're seeing all these people struggle.\"\n\nFiscal conservatives question whether the money could be spent more effectively, like to bolster county efforts and existing youth behavioral health programs.\n\nRepublican state Sen. Roger Niello, vice chair of the Senate Budget and Fiscal Review Committee, noted that California is forecasted to face deficits for the next three years, and taxpayer watchdogs worry the apps might cost even more in the long run.\n\n\"What starts as a small financial commitment can become uncontrollable expenses down the road,\" said Susan Shelley of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association.",

        "text": "\"There's lots of different metrics now that we can begin to look at,\" says Dr. Davin Lundquist, family physician and chief medical officer at Augmedix. \"Anytime that we can have a greater awareness of our health and paying attention to it, it tends to influence behavior in a positive way.\"\n\nHere are four that doctors say can be useful to monitor:\n\nMost healthy adults can benefit from sleep tracking to some level, says Dr. Carlos M. Nunez, chief medical officer at medical device company ResMed.\n\n\"Many users aren't tracking the right information and can end up fixating or misinterpreting the data rather than observing the larger trends that the trackers can help to indicate,\" Nunez says. \"Users should start by tracking their sleep-wake cycle to establish a consistent routine of quality sleep, which research has shown can lead to improved concentration, increased productivity and feeling overall more positive.\"\n\nTracking your heart rate can give you a picture into your heart health. The lower your resting heart rate, within reason, the healthier your heart is, explains Lundquist.\n\n\"If you're doing more aerobic exercise, over time, your resting heart rate should decline. And that would be an indication that your heart is getting healthier,\" he says.\n\n\"Certain devices can also provide insight into potential key health indicators - such as your respiratory rates, activity level and more,\" Nunez says. \"For some users, the data can also indicate how your body is responding to stress.\"\n\nRespiratory rate is a metric that may alert someone to other health issues, too. That's something Michael Snyder, a Stanford School of Medicine professor who has studied smartwatches, experienced firsthand after coming down with COVID-19. Though he took a COVID test that came back negative, his own research app alerted him to sudden changes in his breathing and heart rates.\n\n\"I had a patient whose Apple Watch told them that they had a run of atrial fibrillation,\" Lundquist said. \"We got this person into a cardiologist -- sure enough, it was confirmed and the patient was adequately treated.\"\n\n\"Afib (atrial fibrillation) is a big deal,\" cardiologist Dr. Tara Narula told \"CBS Mornings\" in 2018 as Apple rolled out electrocardiogram technology in its smartwatches to help detect the heart issue. \"It affects millions of Americans, increases hospitalization rates (and) increases death and heart failure.\"\n\nIt also increases risk for potentially debilitating strokes by five times, she added.\n\n\"The problem with afib is that it can be asymptomatic, so you can be walking around and not know you have it while you're at increased risk of stroke,\" she explained, noting that a tracking device could help empower patients, but could also lead to false alarm: \"Anxiety, false positives, flooding doctors' offices with calls.

        "text": "There's a battle taking place for satellite-based direct-to-cellular services. AST SpaceMobile is one such player, while the likes of Globalstar (linked with Apple) and Starlink (linked with T-Mobile and others) are also looking to tap into what they all suggest is a potentially large market for connectivity.\n\nHowever, it is Lynk Global, based in Virginia, that has signed what could be a significant contract with the US Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) to provide commercial sat2phone services to the US Department of Defense (DoD), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and other US government agencies.\n\nLynk says this exclusive contract enables the DoD, DHS and other US government agencies to commercially purchase sat2phone services for the next 5 years, and includes an option to extend the contract for 5 more years. Services available under the contract include SMS text messaging, emergency cell broadcast alerts, and LynkCast weather and information broadcast services.\n\nMargo Deckard, Lynk's co-founder and COO, commented: \"Lynk will enable US government agencies to access life-saving emergency communications to help the American people when terrestrial mobile networks are non-existent or have failed. DISA and US Space Force will save lives through the Proliferated Low Earth Orbit (PLEO) contract vehicle. We are humbled to serve the people who risk their lives for the American people.\"\n\nThe US government is the world's largest customer of commercial satellite communications, and buys those services through DISA. In 2022, DISA released a PLEO satellite services solicitation for the first time. Of the 20 companies that received DISA PLEO awards, Lynk is the only firm which received a contract for sat2phone connectivity.\n\nCharles Miller, Lynk's co-founder and CEO, added: \"The US Department of Defense has been field testing Lynk's technology for several years. We are deeply grateful for the trust that the DoD has given to Lynk with their decision to give us the first-ever sat2phone contract. This contract will enable the nearly three million men and women in the DoD to use the existing phone in their pockets to stay connected everywhere. No matter what happens.\"\n\nLynk has patents in its portfolio and today allows commercial subscribers to send and receive text messages to and from space via standard unmodified, mobile devices. Lynk says its service has been tested and proven on all seven continents, has regulatory approvals in at least 30 countries and is currently being deployed commercially based on more than 40 MNO commercial service contracts covering approximately 50 countries. Lynk is currently providing cell broadcast (emergency) alerts, and two-way SMS messaging, and intends to launch voice and mobile broadband services in the future.\n\nBy partnering with Lynk, says the company, a mobile network operator opens the door to new revenue in untapped markets, gives subscribers peace of mind with ubiquitous connectivity, and provides a potential pathway to economic prosperity for billions.\n\nThe rationale for Lynk is that only 10 per cent of the planet is equipped with cell-towers. While much of the rest is ocean or uninhabited the company says its 'cell-tower-in-space' strategy can serve an estimated 750 million mobile phone users who are not connected.\n\nIt deployed its next pair of Sat2Phone satellites in March. It already has an impressive number of telco partnerships signed up including Turkcell, Telefonica, Telikom (PNG) and certain Vodafone territories. It says it will launch up to 74 satellites by 2025 and thousands more over the next few years.",

View their Economic Update Visual Deck.\n\nWe're going to dive into a bunch of things, but you guys had a quote that perked my ears up. You said, \"This is the best relative asset allocation opportunity we've seen in 35 years.\"\n\nWhat do you guys mean by that? That's quite a statement.\n\nCatherine:\n\nYeah. So first, important words are relative. So it's a best relative opportunity in the sense that, hey, we think we can do a lot better than a passive 60/40 stock-bond portfolio. The relative is the ability to outperform. And asset allocation is saying, \"We can outperform by picking the right asset classes.\"\n\nSo why is it the best relative asset allocation opportunity in 35 years? Well, first, when we look across asset classes, we can find assets that we like in every asset class. There are things to buy everywhere. And at GMO, the way we decide that we like something is by looking at its valuation. How attractively priced is this asset today? How much can it deliver on the promise of future returns? In every area, equities, bonds, credit, currencies, we can find things that are cheap and attractive.\n\nSecond, we find very wide dispersion across asset classes. We find some asset classes that we like a lot better than other asset classes. So by not holding one, and holding more of the other, you're getting a good relative opportunity. Areas where we see great relative opportunities today, we prefer non-US stocks relative to US stocks. We see much better valuations there. We prefer value stocks to growth stocks. In fact, we see some of the widest relative opportunity between value and growth that we've ever seen historically, and we particularly favor deep value, the very cheapest stocks.\n\nFinally, we see a lot of dispersion in currencies. You've got the US dollar close to all-time peak expensiveness, but you've got other currencies, the yen, the euro, the pound, looking close to all-time cheapness. So by leaning in to those things that we like a lot, the non-US markets, the value stocks, the cheaper currencies, we think we can outperform a traditional portfolio by quite a lot. We do this quantitatively, by comparing our forecast today for this portfolio focusing on these better relative opportunities, to just a classic passive 60/40 stock-bond portfolio. We measure how good that performance opportunity is. We've been looking at this for 35 years, and we see it as the best we've seen in 35 years.\n\nMeb:\n\nWell, that's exciting, but I'm going to play devil's advocate. Say I'm a listener, and I say, \"All right, Catherine, we've heard about GMO people on Meb's podcast before. We've heard Meb say not too dissimilar things. And you know what? I've just been chilling out in SPY, which since the bottom of the GFC has been printing me money at 15% a year. And you know what? In the last couple of years I said, 'That's not enough. I'm moving to the Qs.' So I put most of my money in NVIDIA and Facebook and Apple, and so I look like I really know what I'm doing. Why should I listen to you guys? Because it seems like my Sharpe ratio of one is cleaning y'all's clock.\" How do you respond to that?\n\nCatherine:\n\nYou've had a beautiful decade. To this hypothetical investor, that has been a brilliant decade. But my first piece of investing advice is, when you're looking at what to hold today to find something that's going to perform for the next 10 years, you shouldn't really necessarily be focused on what has performed for the prior 10 years. You have to look at the fundamentals of the asset today and the valuation of the asset today.\n\nSo two concerns I have about your favorite asset, be it the S&P 500 or the NASDAQ, whichever index you're liking the best right now. One concern I have is it's looking really expensive relative to history. So it's had a brilliant decade, but it's got to the point where it is pretty expensive. One metric we like to look at for expensiveness is a Shiller P/E ratio, a cyclically adjusted P/E ratio. It smooths out some of the volatility of earnings and fundamentals, and that Shiller P/E ratio, price-earnings ratio for the S&P 500 today is about 34. That's in the neighborhood of all-time highs, maybe top 1% relative to history. It's a dangerous time to buy into that asset. The NASDAQ has also recently re-hit close to all-time highs. So both are looking pretty expensive.\n\nThe second concern I have beyond valuation is both of those indexes are looking very concentrated. You've got the top names in the index taking up a lot of share of the index. One thing investors love about indexes is that they're a diversified group of stocks, it's a way to buy the whole market, but today you're getting a lot of exposure to those stocks that folks have called the Mag Seven, the Magnificent Seven stocks. They're taking up a lot of share of your index and you're getting a lot of specific risk for those assets. You're also buying an index at a point where the concentration has been rising for a full decade. So my advice would be, now's a good time to take those profits and invest in something that looks cheaper today. Pivot a little bit in your portfolio.\n\nMeb:\n\nOne of the big key understandings, I think, for investors is, you don't have to accept asset classes prepackaged. So when you think of US stocks, it doesn't have to mean S&P 500, or market cap weight, or SPY. That's not the only menu on the buffet. When you go to the buffet, hey, you could get the sesame chicken, you could get anything you want. So we did a tweet that was inspired by some of the work y'all did this past week, where we said, \"Look, you want a way to beat the S&P[over the last 50 years, all you have to do is take out the top stock, or even the top 10. It doesn't even really matter. It's just you move away from this market cap weight, which often is the more expensive things and the heavier things, and you outperform by 30 basis points just for doing that alone.\"\n\nYou guys had a piece, it's called Magnificently Concentrated, in the Q-on with Ben and John, and you guys talked about this top-heaviness. Maybe drill in a little bit about this opportunity.\n\nCatherine:\n\nWhat you just mentioned, we did directly point out in that paper. That over the very long term, but by avoiding the top 10 largest names in the index and owning the other 490, you would've outperformed. You would've outperformed over a 50-year period. The past decade has been an anomaly, where those top 10 names have outperformed everything else, and that has been because of this rising concentration. The S&P 500 has gotten to the point where it is today magnificently concentrated, because in a stark difference from history, those 10 names just got bigger and bigger throughout the decade.\n\nThat means several things. One thing it means is it's been a really tough time for active managers to outperform. So when you're in an environment where the very largest stocks in the index are consistently getting larger, active managers, who almost by definition don't hold those larger names, they're holding the names that they find most attractive, they're going to struggle to outperform.\n\nOne feature of the decade has been, it's been a rough decade for active management in US markets. I think going forward it's going to be a lot more attractive for active management. Another is, at this peak concentration level, you want to think about holding different things. You want to think about things you were just mentioning, Meb. You mentioned quality, value. Both of those I think are brilliant ideas. Quality, we think of that as an assessment of the company's underlying fundamentals. How profitable? How consistently profitable? How much is this company relying on leverage? We hope not very much. So a high quality company is profitable, consistently profitable, and does not need debt to fuel its profits. That is always a wonderful factor to look for. Consistently it has worked beautifully, and today, you don't have to pay a premium at all to get a higher quality portfolio. So you absolutely should. You can get a little free downside protection by having a quality portfolio.\n\nAnother thing to look for is value. In the US equity market we see value, and in particular, the deep value cohort, the cheapest 20%, as truly dislocated in the equity market. It is close to as cheap as it has ever been, top decile cheap. So try pivoting a little bit toward value. We also see opportunities in small-cap as well. So doing something a little bit different from the S&P 500 today seems to be a great way to play it.\n\nMeb:\n\nThe chart of exhibit two in that magnificently correlated piece is such a telling chart. This is the top 10 stocks in the S&P 500 versus the other 490 equally weighted. What this looks to me, you can see that this has underperformed almost 2.5% per year since the 1950s. 2.5% per year would make you the best mutual fund manager in the world if you created that alpha problem. This is why it's hard, and this is why investing in general is so hard, if you have these face-ripper periods. So you see this chart, and you see, \"oh, man, I could totally do that. I could totally invest in this portfolio and garner this alpha juice every year,\" but you have these periods.\n\nLook, the entire '90s looks like a period. You have parts of the '50s and '60s, but even more importantly, this last decade, where it says buying the top 10 is outperformed, instead of underperforming, the top 10 is outperformed by 5% a year, which is a monster amount. So every once in a while you get these little face-rippers that cause everyone to get hot and bothered for the big dudes and rinse, repeat before they go back down.\n\nEveryone listening to this is probably going to ask the same question, because I know, because I get it all the time on Twitter. They're going to say, \"Catherine, great. You probably would've said this with Meb last year or the year prior. How do I know when this is going to turn?\"\n\nCatherine:\n\nWell, you just pointed out two times historically where investors have been punished by loading into the top mega-cap stocks in the index. The '70s, which we would think of today in hindsight as a nifty 50 stock market bubble, so in the midst of a stock market bubble, and then also the '90s, which today we call the tech bubble or the dot-com bubble. So if you do look back to history, if you were to pile in to the top winners of the prior decade, either in that mid-70s period or the late '90s period, it would've been disastrous for you in the subsequent period. So I would say in terms of looking at a decision factor, just that alone should guide you that, \"Oh, given that we've just had a phenomenal decade for these top 10 stocks, I should probably be rotating it away from that today, if history is any guide.\"\n\nNow, what's the catalyst that's actually going to cause things to turn around? That is an incredibly difficult question. Today we have the benefit of hindsight. We can look through history, we can look at the tech bubble, and even with the benefit of diagnosing with hindsight, can you tell me exactly what was the catalyst that caused that tech bubble to pop in 2000? I really can't.\n\nMeb:\n\nWe love to come up with a narrative after the fact and it becomes obvious perhaps, but sometimes it's just gravity, and weight, and shift. It feels like some of the narratives are already shifting. We'll come back to that later. But, agreed, it doesn't have to be one, at least in real time.\n\nCatherine:\n\nI think what you said about gravity makes a lot of sense. Eventually stocks can't live up to the amazing promise we expect for them. Investor expectations are just so high that you can't meet those expectations, and you see those perhaps very good companies just fall under the weight of too high investor expectations.\n\nMeb:\n\nAll right. So you guys like value. You like quality. You guys have a particular asterisk next to that, which is interesting because you say not just value, we want deep value, the deepest of all values. What does that mean? And you guys aren't a small boutique investment manager, you're a pretty big shop, so it's not like you're buying five stocks, but what does deep value mean to you guys? How do you guys think about it or define it, and why is that so much better than just regular old value?\n\nCatherine:\n\nWhen we think about value, typically we are talking about the cheaper half of the market. And typically when we say growth, we mean the more expensive half of the market. So two halves of the market, value and growth. Well, we've started to take a finer comb at this value cycle and say, \"Well, what if we looked at smaller, more defined segments of the market?\" For example, what if instead of just looking at the cheap half of the market, we look at the cheapest 20% of the market?\" Then we've got deep value, but there's still that 30% of value stocks that's not accounted for in the deep value. We've decided to call that shallow value. So you have two components in your value universe, deep value and shallow value. And when we look at those two components in the US, it's pretty fascinating. If you just look at the value, cheap 50%, it looks cheap in the US. It looks very cheap.\n\nBut if you then split it into the deep value, the cheapest 20% of stocks, and the shallow value, the next 30% that completes the universe, that deep value is top decile cheap versus history. It's only been cheaper a handful of periods than it is today. Whereas those shallow value stocks, they're actually trading expensive relative to their own history. So a pretty big difference there, as cheap as it's ever been, versus actually, those shallow value stocks in relative terms, relative to the market, are trading quite expensive relative to history, maybe top 20% relative to history. That's a pretty big difference, and that's why we're so focused on deep value today. We actually think you don't want to hold those shallow value stocks at all. They're not really cheap.\n\nMeb:\n\nThat's a great point. My ears perk up anytime I hear the word top fractal of anything, but decile really gets me excited. Means there's an opportunity. We did a piece last fall called basically, if you're not going to do value now, you'll probably never do it, because this is about as stretched... can't ever say as stretched because things can always get nuttier, but historically, this is about as stretched as it gets.\n\nNow, there's also an overlapping Venn diagram, maybe the first cousin of value and quality in the US, and that's our friends outside of the US borders. So foreign stocks, emerging market stocks. Talk to us a little bit about the opportunity there. Can we get away with just buying EFA and EEM, or is it a similar situation where the value opportunity is interesting there in the deep parts of the pool too?\n\nCatherine:\n\nYeah, I think value is just too cheap to ignore it outside the US. In general, we think markets outside the US are on average cheaper than markets in the US. So already you're getting a benefit by going outside the US. But pretty much everywhere you look outside the US, value's pretty dislocated. In the developed markets outside the US on average, such as the UK, Europe, Japan, we're finding deep value to decile cheap there as well. So that's an opportunity you do not want to miss.\n\nNow, that shallow value group, the next 30%, that's pretty cheap as well outside the US, but I'd still get into the deep value. When value wins, deep value always, always wins by more, and value is priced incredibly well. So you should just go for the full deep value punch, both in the US and outside the US.\n\nMeb:\n\nCinnamon is squishy and narrative's flows are less squishy, and we've been talking about global investing for quite some time, but we started to see a shift, a disturbance in the force, if you may, where people are, A, starting to talk about foreign a little differently. And it feels like this. The quant in me pays no attention to this, but the emotional side of my brain, it feels like there's been a shift. But particularly when it comes to, say, Japan, it feels like the narrative has really shifted hard. Being at all-time highs again I think probably helps drive that as sentiment tends to follow price.\n\nDo you feel like this is becoming a consensus view at all, or is it just the weirdos, you and I, that may be seeing this opportunity and looking for confirming evidence? How do you feel as you have conversations with some of the world's largest investors? How's the conversation? Were they still angry when you brought up foreign and emerging?\n\nCatherine:\n\nJapan is certainly one where I've seen a change in sentiment from institutional investors. At GMO, we've liked Japan for a long time. The valuations are pretty reasonable. Value has been quite cheap in Japan, so you get a little extra. Today the yen is at an all-time low. There's a lot of reasons to like going to Japan. Additionally, we think there's this extra tailwind in Japan as stocks and companies have been becoming a bit more shareholder friendly. They care a little bit more about the return on capital they give to shareholders. They've been encouraged by the governments to care about that. So we think there's this additional tailwind of return and reform there.\n\nI've been telling that story to our investors for quite some time. We've had an overweight to Japan in our portfolios, and I would say in the past year I've seen them perk up and want to engage in the discussion more. What is causing that sentiment to change? I'm not sure, but it certainly doesn't hurt when Warren Buffett gives something his seal of approval.\n\nMeb:\n\nOh, you stole my punch line. I was getting ready to say, when Omaha comes to town I feel like that definitely perks people up.\n\nYou mentioned currencies, which are hard. You already said the number one worst thing to say earlier, which was CAPE ratio, but now you also mentioned currencies, which I feel like are more confusing than anything for investors. When you guys do your asset class forecasted expected returns chart, which people love to talk about because there's a pretty wide spread, and at least my pet favorite, emerging value, seems to be one of the leaders in the locker room, you also talk about how currencies may play a role. What do you think about that?\n\nCatherine:\n\nWell, when you look at our 7-year asset class forecast, which we post online, two things to know. One, is they're done in real terms, so they're a forecasted return above inflation, and two, local currency. We are showing local currency returns. It's not from a US dollar investor point of view. Now, normally that's a wonderful thing, particularly for GMO, or a global investment management firm. So I can be talking to investors in the UK, in Australia, in Canada, in Europe, and these forecasts are equally relevant to everyone. So in the standard view of our forecast, we're not including any expected return from currency at all.\n\nTypically, I think that is perfectly fine. Generally we don't have a very high expected return associated with a currency component of your investment in non-US equities, because like you say, there's a lot of volatility to currencies, and typically you're not necessarily projecting a very high or low, positive or negative return from the currency component. But we do value currencies in addition to equities, rates, and credits, and we are using a valuation-based approach. So we are expecting over the long term that currencies will revert to some sort of fundamental fair value, a purchasing power parity type fair value, kind of like the Big Mac Index. For most currencies, I'd say the thing that we do differently is we assume a much longer mean reversion horizon for currencies. What we're trying to say by that is, we think that generally valuation is less powerful for currencies than it is for other asset classes, except at extremes. Once you get to extremes on currency valuations, valuation can be quite powerful.\n\nToday is one of those extremes. The US dollar is close to all-time highs, other currencies are correspondingly cheap. So now is the time you should be considering currencies as you're making decisions about where to allocate your equity dollars. Because investing outside the US, you can get an additional tailwind from currency return, I'm going to say on the order of two to four percentage points of additional return.\n\nYou can earn that in two different ways. One, I would call the easy way, currencies simply appreciate, and as an US dollar-based investor, you would get that additional return. But even if currencies don't appreciate, you have a second way you can win by investing in companies in cheap currencies. And that is simply that companies in consistently cheap currencies, if the currencies don't appreciate, tend to have a higher earnings growth. They're able to take advantage of being the low-cost producer. So two ways to capture that additional tailwind from currencies. And I'd say today, currencies are cheap enough that you should consider it when you're choosing where to invest your equities.\n\nMeb:\n\nSo to frame where I should be traveling in 2024 and 2025, what currencies are most undervalued relative to the purchasing power if the US dollar is up there? Are there any countries that come to mind in general? I think Japan just hit 155?\n\nCatherine:\n\nI would say anyone who doesn't use the word dollar in describing their currency. I'd skip Canada, I'd skip Australia, I'd skip New Zealand, but every place else is looking cheap. Go to Japan, go to Europe, go to the UK. Go to some emerging market countries, enjoy them all.\n\nMeb:\n\nMost investors, US focused, 60/40. We talked about pivoting towards value. We talked about moving to foreign and emerging in value there. What should investors think about bonds in general? Fixed income? We can even tie in some real assets. You guys don't talk as much about real assets, but bonds usually mean one thing to investors, in my mind. It means two things in the US. They either do some sort of Treasury ladder, so they put all their money in TIPS, or they buy 10 years, or they just buy the AGG, or something like a bond aggregate, which is half government bonds, a quarter of corporates, and a quarter of agencies, maybe-ish. But the world's also your oyster when it comes to fixed income. We have 5% all of a sudden again on T-bills. What should people think about that giant bond component now that we're no longer in the ZURB world?\n\nCatherine:\n\nThank goodness that bonds are now ownable. For many years we actually thought that bond yields were so bad that they couldn't give you any of the promises that bonds have in your portfolio. If you roll back to 2021, so pre-2022, and you were considering, should I buy a US 10-year Treasury? Yields got down to 1%, below 1% nominal yield. At that level, the bond can't give you depression protection because the yield has no place to fall in an economic downturn, and it can't give you real income, because it is unreasonable to expect inflation to be lower than that over the long term. So for a while, Treasuries were simply unownable, untouchable, and now you can happily buy a 10-year Treasury and hold it in your portfolio. So first of all, traditional government bonds are absolutely ownable in your portfolio.\n\nIf you move down the line, you mentioned the Bloomberg Aggregate, and there I would say the next group of assets that you would look at would be the corporate bonds. So bonds of corporations. And corporate credit spreads are really tight. You mentioned things that get you excited, Meb, when it's top decile relative to history. Well, corporate credit spreads, both investment grade and high yield, are bottom decile relative to history. They're really quite tight. So I'm not sure that corporate credit is where you want to spend your fixed income dollars. Treasuries are ownable, corporate credit I'm feeling a little bit less excited about.\n\nThen you mentioned agency mortgages, which tends to be our least favorite segment of the structured credit market. What are agency mortgages? They're mortgages like you and I would have on our house, but they're guaranteed by the government. And because they're guaranteed by the government, they typically offer you basically no spread whatsoever, and so they're not terribly interesting. The spreads on agencies did pop out recently, so they're actually paying you at some points in the curve something above Treasuries, which is better, but typically our least favorite part of structured credit. I would not ignore structured credit though, you can do so much better than what's in the aggregate.\n\nThere's a lot of other things to own. There's non-agency mortgages, there's commercial mortgages, there's collateralized loan obligations, there's asset-backed securities, there's student loans. That is one of my favorite areas of the credit markets. It offers better spread than corporate credit, and it is an incredibly fragmented marketplace. So those little dislocations that you were just mentioning that you quite like, when things are at extreme relative to history, they pop up in segments of that market all the time and there's a lot of opportunity to take advantage of it.\n\nSo if I had to pick some favorites, all within the US fixed income space, I would say go for Treasuries, have that nice safe piece of your portfolio. And then in credit, I'd say take a broader look at structured credit than just agency mortgages.\n\nMeb:\n\nOne you didn't mention was TIPS. I did a fun poll. I don't think anyone really understands TIPS, because I asked, \"At what point would you sell your stocks and buy TIPS at various real yields?\" And most people, I think, said never, or something like 8% real yields.\n\nJeremy was on a podcast recently where he was talking about TIPS in the late '90s, after they got introduced, were trading at 4.5 real-\n\n... or something like that, which, listeners, today I think it's maybe 2 1/4, which isn't bad.\n\nCatherine:\n\nYeah, which is pretty good because that's a straight return above inflation. So I'd say TIPS and nominal Treasuries, they're looking similarly attractive, and definitely be happy to buy the TIPS. They're not part of the Bloomberg Aggregate Index, which is another reason to ignore that index because there's many wonderful things to buy in fixing outside of that index.\n\nAnother area that's outside of the Bloomberg Aggregate Index that we've liked quite a lot through history, and even today, is Emerging Country Debt. So debt not of the US government, but of non-US countries, emerging market countries. They pay you a really lovely credit spread to bear the risk of default over time, and they're also on the market with a lot of opportunity for active return. The spreads have gotten a little bit tight, but they're still pretty attractive in Emerging Country Debt. So another area outside of that Aggregate Index to consider for your portfolio.\n\nMeb:\n\nI was just looking up Chinese bonds, because as we all know, China stocks have gotten pummeled. What are they, down 60% or something? But Chinese bonds have done, to my knowledge, not so bad.\n\nCatherine:\n\nYeah, I would not advise buying a lot of Chinese debt, just because it doesn't pay much spread.\n\nProbably places that you would not want to go to or you've never heard of. So the areas where the Emerging Country Debt team at GMO won by the most last year, some areas where they won a lot, were Argentina and Venezuela. Which is usually not how you start a conversation getting someone excited about something, but they made massive alpha by being in those markets and assessing those risks of those markets that other investors perhaps don't want to invest in.\n\nMeb:\n\nOne of my best angel investments ever was in Venezuela, so the world is your oyster, listeners.\n\nAll right, so we've been cruising around the world. So TIPS is a real asset, but how do you guys think about other real assets? That could be REITs, real estate. Jeremy calls them R-E-I-Ts, by the way, which I've never heard before. I say REITs. But so REITs, TIPS, and gold are hitting all-time highs. Anything else in the commodity or commodity equities complex? Are those areas an interesting part of a portfolio or particularly tackily right now?\n\nCatherine:\n\nOn those choices, TIPS, definitely yes, we just talked about it. That's a good place to invest in your portfolio and it's absolutely a real asset. It's giving you a real return and it's well-priced. REITs, I'm less thrilled with as an asset. Their yields have gone up from all-time lows, but still not incredibly attractive. And we're a little bit cautious about REITs as an asset class at any rate. The only time GMO has ever taken a big bet on REITs is when they were offering double-digit yields. I would say that was in the early 2000s. So it's pretty rare for us to like REITs, but we're not close-minded to it. No asset is uninvestable, just you have to find the right price, and the REITs are not offering you the right price today.\n\nAs I continue to go, gold I would be a definite no on, at all-time highs. That stock price looks like it's gone parabolic so far this year. So as a valuation-based investor, you're more inclined to be short than long. But then your last suggestion, which was something like commodity equities, so resources equity, that's something we love. Over the long term, commodity equities have given you the diversification of commodities, with the equity risk premium of equities. So that's a pretty magical asset right there. And they're awfully well-priced today. There is one place that our Resources Equity team invests in that I think it's overlooked, and again, like you said, you love a good dislocation. It's a great dislocation today. That's clean energy. Clean energy has gotten incredibly cheap. These are effectively growth stocks that are trading at deep value prices.\n\nSo all those assets you just offered me, on the safe side, I would buy the TIPS, and on the, \"Hey, I'm going for return,\" side, I would buy the resources, the commodity equities, and I'd tilt a bit into the clean energy right there. Not as an ESG play, but as a pure, \"Hey, I'm going to make a lot of money,\" opportunity.\n\nMeb:\n\nI like the sounds of that. I don't know if anyone's mentioned something quite like that recently on the pod, so listeners, dig in. What have we left out as we travel around the world? I feel like we've covered most general things. You guys do a little bit of shorting, I believe, but are there any other tactics, or things that we've skipped over that you guys are thinking about?\n\nCatherine:\n\nWe do from time to time use a lot of liquid alternatives, hedge fund type strategies, and those look pretty great today. Hedge fund type strategies often will offer you cash plus return. Cash is looking pretty good. And the plus, which is that relative value opportunity, that's looking pretty attractive as well today.\n\nSo as you can guess from what I've said some of my favorite ideas are today, our favorite idea in liquid alternative or hedge fund space is a long deep value, short expensive growth strategy. Getting cash plus a wonderful relative value spread, that's a wonderful place to be invested. It has the beauty of equity-like return prospects with no correlation to equities.\n\nMeb:\n\nAs people try to process everything you've been talking about today, which is a lot, what do you think of the big muscle movement, if you're like, \"All right, listen to the end of this podcast. I got to have one takeaway from a traditional 60/40 person.\" Is it, hey, lean into value in the US. Does it look foreign? Is it more on the fixed income side? All these things obviously are additive, but if you had to say, \"Look, we'll just pound the table. One thing you got to think about today, Mr. NVIDIA...\" What is it?\n\nCatherine:\n\nYou can sum everything you just said up in one sentence. Be willing to buy something other than S&P 500.\n\nMeb:\n\nI love it. We got some show note links we'll add, listeners, a whole host of resources, papers from GMO, as well as some other firms on this topic that I think is pretty interesting.\n\nWhat's a belief that you have, and it could be current or it could be timeless, that 75% of your peers don't agree with or think, what she's got to say is silly, that doesn't make any sense?\n\nCatherine:\n\nThat's a pretty easy question for me, actually, because often I'm invited into the room to be the contrarian, to think something different and to do something different. In fact, I've had a number of asset class forecast debates where I'm specifically brought in as the person who thinks differently.\n\nIn the type of atmosphere you've mentioned where, hey, we're all sitting around chatting and we're debating, the conversation often moves in the direction of short-term predictions. So, \"What do you think is going to happen to inflation this year? How many times is the Federal Reserve going to cut rates? How bad is conflict in the Middle East going to get? Who's going to win the US presidential election?\" And I think the belief I have, or the thing that I would say is contrarian is, \"Generally it doesn't matter and that's not a good space for me to spend my time.\"\n\nThose things are incredibly difficult to predict with consistent accuracy. And even if you can predict these types of things with consistent accuracy, it doesn't matter at all for long-term asset values and returns, and I'm not even sure it matters that much in the short term. It's hard to make money that way. So I think a lot of times you'll find multi-asset managers, macro managers, investors, debating, chatting about these topics, and I don't think that's the best use of our time and effort.\n\nMeb:\n\nWhat a wet blanket. I was hoping you were going to go down the list, tell us who's going to win the election, tell us what the Fed is going to do.\n\nCatherine:\n\nYeah, that would make for a good podcast, but I'm just not sure it's a good investment strategy. So I guess I am contrarian, that sounds like.\n\nMeb:\n\nIt's such a dislocation between what people talk about all day on TV, what people spend most of their time just spinning their wheels about, which is these things, A, they can't control, B, that are largely unknowable. And if you look at the long history of forecasting things, even by the Fed, of interest rates and the path and direction, they don't know. So why do we spend all of our time focusing on these narratives and stories?\n\nAs you look back at your career, this could be at GMO, could be elsewhere, what's been your most memorable investment?\n\nCatherine:\n\nI, like you, love weird market events, anomalies, dislocation, bubbles. Bubbles are one of my favorite things. So I'd say memorable investments are always ones that come out of a market dislocation or a bubble. My favorite investment is the one that we're playing today, which is a long deep value, short expensive growth dislocation strategy. I guess there's maybe a little recency bias there, but I love this strategy. It was born out of this massive value growth dislocation that we really identified in 2020. Things had gotten out of control. So you've got the bubble element there.\n\nThe act of designing a strategy around a top-down idea is pretty fascinating. How do you actually put together a portfolio to make money from your investment thesis? That's great. I also love this investment strategy because it has been equity-like returns, and we think forecasted equity-like returns, with no correlation to equities. Completely different pattern. So value versus growth was up 17% in 2022, when equities were down 17%. You're getting something different. And finally, it's got a lot further to run. A memorable place to look for investments is always your big bubbles, your big dislocations.\n\nMeb:\n\nMine was certainly the late '90s. I have so many memories, and the podcast listeners have certainly heard me drone on about all the different stories. There's probably another dozen that I've never even told before. 2021 was at the peak of craziness, February. Our old thread wad to the show notes called what in carnation of just all the crazy stuff.\n\nYeah. I never thought I'd see anything quite like that again, and that was pretty loony tunes. But that's what creates the opportunity set, and that's what creates the dislocations of course. Do you see any other crazy bubbles around the world today, or anything that's particularly nutty, or something we should avoid in that regard?\n\nCatherine:\n\nWell, we mentioned it. You mentioned NVIDIA. AI, artificial intelligence, has gotten a little bit nutty. It seems to be a little bit like the fervor, the fear of missing out that's a bit like the euphoria, you've been mentioning it. That's a little bit crazy. Also, briefly, you mentioned it where you mentioned the price of gold, but commodity markets are going pretty haywire as well. It's not just gold, it's cocoa. Watch the price of your favorite chocolate bar. These things are going through the roof. So you're definitely seeing weird things across markets.\n\nMeb:\n\nDandelion chocolates, have you had that? They're my favorite.\n\nCatherine:\n\nNo. But I do love chocolate, so I'm surprised you're mentioning a chocolate I haven't eaten.\n\nMeb:\n\nThis is the best chocolate, hands down, across the board. I willingly pay 60 bucks, I think... It's like, once a quarter they send a handful of bars. They're not cheap, but I think it's the best chocolate I've ever had.\n\nCatherine:\n\nKeep your eye on the price because cocoa has more than doubled year-to-date, so you're going to be paying more for your-\n\nMeb:\n\nI think it's more than that, isn't it? I don't know where it is. It makes NVIDIA look like a T-bill. But it's funny because I was talking about this on Twitter. You've seen some of these old school trend followers, these managed futures guys. There's some that have been around since the '80s, and they're particularly near and dear to my heart, because as with so much of the investing world, when you get bigger, the temptation to become a closet indexer and collect fees is high. And you guys don't do that. You guys are willing to be concentrated, weird, and different. But the managed futures folk, which had a very long fallow period post-GFC for probably a decade too, but some of these old school guys are very DGAF, they don't care. So they still have these highly volatile concentrated weird portfolios.\n\nTwo in particular we mentioned on Twitter, Mulvaney and DUNN, I think in February and March, put up something like back-to-back 40% months up each. 40% each in February and March. I love to see it. They're not low vol, and it's like the hedge fund cowboys of yore to see some of these old school trend followers. But I imagine not a trivial amount of that was cocoa. So you can help blame them for the dandelion being 60 bucks or whatever it is.\n\nCatherine, it's been a lot of fun. Where do people find your writings coming up, your prognostications, what you're up to? Where's the best place to go?",

Smith-Cameron in a recurring role and additional guest appearances from Christina Hendricks, Christopher Lloyd, Helen Hunt, George Wallace, Tony Goldwyn, and Dan Bucatinsky. The new season picks up about a year after the events of the S2 finale, which saw Smart's Deborah Vance finding success with her standup special but firing Einbinder's Ava Daniels. Expect two new episodes per week through May 30.\n\nStreaming movie\n\nPremieres May 2 on Prime Video\n\nMichael Showalter (The Big Sick) directs a May-December romance starring Anne Hathaway as a 40-year-old divorced single mother who begins a whirlwind romance with the lead singer of a popular boy band (Nicholas Galitzine) after a chance encounter with him at Coachella. Reid Scott and Annie Mumolo also star in Amazon's streaming-only adaptation of Robinne Lee's 2017 debut novel, adapted by screenwriter Jennifer Westfeldt (Friends with Kids). Critics enjoyed the rom-com when it debuted at SXSW earlier this year and highlighted Hathaway's charming performance.\n\nLimited series\n\nPremieres May 2 on Netflix\n\nJeff Daniels heads the cast of David E. Kelley's six-episode adaptation of the 1998 novel of the same name by Tom Wolfe. Daniels plays Charlie Croker, an Atlanta real estate mogul who is suddenly faced with the prospect of bankruptcy and the collapse of his empire. Directed in part by Regina King, the miniseries also stars Diane Lane, William Jackson Harper, Lucy Liu, Bill Camp, Tom Pelphrey, Sarah Jones, and Ami Ameen. Slightly divisive following its release, Man was just the second novel written by the longtime journalist, and Wolfe's prior novel (The Bonfire of the Vanities) didn't translate well to film, though his nonfiction book The Right Stuff became a terrific movie. How will this adaptation fare?\n\nLimited series\n\nPremieres May 2 on Peacock\n\nA co-production from Peacock and the UK's Sky, this Holocaust drama is based on the best-selling novel by Heather Morris that chronicles the real-life romance between Auschwitz-Birkenau prisoners Lali and Gita Sokolov (played here by Jonah Hauer-King and Anna Próchniak). Harvey Keitel plays Lali six decades later as he shares his story with writer Morris (Melanie Lynskey). All six episodes will be available to stream on day one.\n\nLimited series\n\nPremieres May 3 on Netflix\n\nPart of the 12-day Netflix Is a Joke Festival being held in Los Angeles in early May, this six-night event series finds comedian John Mulaney exploring the city with a number of comedian guests in town for the festival. Expect a mix of live segments, pre-taped field pieces, and musical guests. The May 3rd debut airs live at 10p ET/7p PT, while additional episodes air live at the same time nightly from May 6-10. In addition, Netflix will stream several other live events from this year's festival including a celebrity roast of Tom Brady (May 5 at 5p ET; yes, of course Jeff Ross will be there) and a Katt Williams stand-up special on May 4 at 7p PT.\n\nStreaming movie\n\nPremieres May 3 on Netflix\n\n\"If Barbie can get her own movie, why can't Pop Tarts?\" Famous words said by nobody, and yet here we are with a Pop Tarts origin story. Jerry Seinfeld (the very same one from Seinfeld) makes his directorial debut with a comedic look back at the real-life race between rival breakfast cereal companies to create a toaster pastry in the early 1960s. Seinfeld also writes (alongside Spike Feresten and others) and stars in a loaded cast that also includes Melissa McCarthy, Hugh Grant, James Marsden, Max Greenfield, Thomas Lennon, Rachael Harris, Christian Slater, Amy Schumer, Maria Bakalova, Jim Gaffigan, Daniel Levy, Fred Armisen, Bill Burr, Sarah Cooper, and Jack McBrayer.\n\nNew sci-fi series\n\nPremieres May 8 on Apple TV+\n\nSure, 3 Body Problem was a Netflix series, but the majority of new sci-fi shows these days seem to arrive on Apple's streaming service, making it one of the few things that Apple TV+ specializes in (along with announcing new and returning shows that never seem to materialize). Their latest is an eight-episode thriller adapted from Blake Crouch's acclaimed 2016 page-turner by the author himself. (That wasn't the case for a previous Crouch TV adaptation, Wayward Pines.) Dark Matter centers on a Chicago physicist (Joel Edgerton) who finds himself kidnapped and taken into a parallel universe. There, he must find a way back to his own timeline to reunite with his wife and son -- but must do so while being pursued by a very familiar foe. Jennifer Connelly, Alice Braga, and Jimmi Simpson also star in the series, which launches with two episodes on the 8th.\n\nNew dramedy series\n\nPremieres May 9 on Netflix\n\nA darkly comedic thriller from two high-profile production companies (Barack and Michelle Obama's Higher Ground, and Mare of Easttown producers Wiip), Bodkin follows a group of podcasters as they investigate a series of disappearances in a small Irish town -- a case that grows weirder the more they learn. It's a mostly Irish cast but the biggest star is an American: Will Forte. You'll be able to binge all seven episodes on day one.\n\nSeason 14 (aka Season 1)\n\nPremieres May 10 on Disney+\n\nSex Education's Ncuti Gatwa takes over as the Fifteenth Doctor as the long-running British sci-fi series moves to Disney+ (except in the UK) for its 14th season. (Note that Disney considers this S1 of a \"new\" series, but you don't have to play along with that.) He'll be joined by new companion Ruby Sunday, played by Millie Gibson, though only for one season on a solo basis -- she'll be joined by Varada Sethu in the already greenlit S15/S2. The network change brings a (slightly) bigger budget and guest stars like Jonathan Groff, Jinkx Monsoon, and Indira Varma. Two episodes stream on premiere day, followed by one per week each Friday.\n\nLimited series\n\nPremieres May 17 on Apple TV+\n\nAndré Holland stars as Huey P. Newton in a six-episode miniseries based on the true story of how the Black Panther leader fled to Cuba with the help of Hollywood producer Bert Schneider (played by Alessandro Nivola) to evade capture by the FBI. A wild true-story escape caper involving a movie producer? If that sounds a bit like Argo, well, The Big Cigar is -- much like that film -- based on a magazine article by Joshuah Bearman. The series adaptation comes from Jim Hecht (Winning Time) and the first two episodes -- directed by Don Cheadle -- stream on day one.\n\nStreaming documentary\n\nPremieres May 24 on Disney+\n\nDisney+ isn't only for comic book fans and kids: There's also something for dads (granddads?) -- or at least those who are fans of 1960s rock. In fact, May brings two such somethings, including a new Disney-exclusive feature documentary about the legendary California band The Beach Boys. Directed by the duo of Frank Marshall (who recently profiled The Bee Gees for HBO) and Thom Zimny (several Bruce Springsteen collabs including Western Stars), the doc includes new interviews with Brian Wilson, Al Jardine, Mike Love, and more.\n\nAlso on tap for Disney+ subscribers this month (on May 8) is a new restoration of Michael Lindsay-Hogg's long-out-of-print 1970 Beatles documentary Let It Be. Footage shot for that movie -- including many hours originally left on the editing-room floor -- were given a hi-tech audio and visual restoration by Peter Jackson for Disney's 2021 miniseries The Beatles: Get Back, and now Jackson has used that same technology to remaster Lindsay-Hogg's original film, which was previously unable to stream, rent, or buy anywhere.\n\nLimited series\n\nPremieres May 30 on Netflix\n\nA six-episode thriller from Abi Morgan (The Iron Lady, The Hour) set in 1980s New York, Eric deals with police corruption amid the NYPD's search for a missing nine-year-old boy -- while the boy's grieving and increasingly unstable father (Benedict Cumberbatch), a popular TV kids show puppeteer, copes by talking to the monster that lives under his son's bed. (Don't snicker: It's actually based on a true story.) Also on board are stars Gaby Hoffmann, Clarke Peters, David Denman, and Dan Fogler, while Lucy Forbes (The End of the F***ing World) directs.\n\nSeason 2\n\nPremieres May 30 on Peacock\n\nA co-production between Peacock and the UK's Channel 4, We Are Lady Parts was hailed by critics as funny, fresh, and upbeat when it debuted in 2021. Three years later, fans finally get to stream a second season, while newcomers have a chance to catch up on this under-the radar comedy centering on an all-female Muslim punk band in London and featuring original songs. This six-episode second season (streaming in its entirety on day one) features guest appearances by Malala Yousafzai and comedian Meera Syal as it follows the band attempting to figure out what they want from their music careers as they record their debut album.\n\nStreaming documentary\n\nPremieres May 31 on Disney+\n\nIt's hard to find anyone who didn't grow up with Jim Henson's creations. The longtime puppeteer, animator, and director is best known for creating The Muppets, both for Sesame Street and for Muppets-branded TV shows and films, and lending his voice to characters like Kermit the Frog and Ernie. But Henson's decades of work also spanned commercials, talk show appearances, experimental film, more children's TV (Fraggle Rock) and feature filmmaking (including The Dark Cystal and Labyrinth). In Idea Man, director Ron Howard dives into Henson's personal archives to bring all these stages of Henson's career to life.",

At just 21 years old and a single mother, she quickly grew a massive Instagram following by documenting her alleged battle with terminal brain cancer, as per Metro. Her claims of overcoming the disease without conventional treatment drew widespread attention, catapulting her to the forefront as an inspiration for many seeking alternative health solutions.\n\nDespite Gibson's claims of miraculous recovery with a plant-based diet and alternative therapies, doubts arose. In 2015, amidst growing suspicion, she admitted to fabricating her cancer diagnosis and deceiving her followers.\n\nShe told Women's Weekly in April 2015, \"None of it is true.\" The revelation shocked her once-loyal audience, who felt betrayed as the truth was revealed. Natalie Dal-Bello, her mother, remarked, \"What a lot of rubbish. Belle never cared about me, her brother is not autistic, and she has never done a minute of housework in her life.\"\n\nThe consequences of Gibson's deception were swift and severe. Her social media accounts were deleted, and Apple removed her app, The Whole Pantry, from its store. Gibson was fined £240,000 for violating Australian consumer law by falsely claiming that proceeds from her app would be donated to charity. The court condemned her self-serving actions, stating her disregard for the welfare of others.\n\nSince her fall from grace, Gibson's life has been marked by financial difficulties and social isolation. Despite court orders to pay fines, she faced additional legal consequences for failing to comply.\n\nReports surfaced of her borrowing money from acquaintances and engaging in excessive spending, further tarnishing her reputation. Her attempts to integrate into Melbourne's Ethiopian community sparked even more controversy, leading to her eventual expulsion.\n\nBelle Gibson's story teaches us that if we don't exercise caution, influence can be dangerous. Even though her downfall is no longer making headlines, her story continues to teach us about honesty and responsibility, particularly in today's digital world.",

After breaking even for the first time last year, Google's cloud operation posted first-quarter profit of $900 million \"- well ahead of analysts' projections of $672.4 million. The unit is viewed as one of Google's best bets for growth as its core search advertising business matures.\n\n\"For years, Google Cloud was usually a weak spot during Alphabet's earnings calls,\" said Lee Sustar, a principal analyst with Forrester Research Inc. \"These latest results show that Google Cloud's AI offerings not only got enterprise customers to take another look, but spend some serious money.\"\n\nGoogle's success with corporate clients follows some embarrassing setbacks in the consumer market. In February, its flagship AI model Gemini was roundly criticized after it spit out historically inaccurate images, prompting the company to stop generating depictions of people.\n\nThe enterprise side of the market has been a very different story, according to Google Cloud Chief Executive Officer Thomas Kurian. The professional version of Gemini comes with various controls to help marketers ensure that the content is staying consistent with their brands. The service can be used to produce ads, ward off cyber threats, and even create videos and podcasts.\n\n\"We are really excited about the benefit from AI for our cloud customers,\" Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said on Thursday. \"We saw an increasing contribution from our AI solutions.\"\n\nFor Microsoft, generative AI is letting the company wring more spending from its core enterprise clients. Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella has been infusing Microsoft's entire product line with AI technology from partner OpenAI. The bet is starting to pay off, with some customers adding AI tools that summarize documents and generate content. They're also signing up for Azure cloud subscriptions featuring OpenAI products.\n\nMicrosoft said sales of its Azure cloud computing platform climbed 31 per cent in the quarter, beating analysts' expectations. About 7 per cent of that increase was attributable to AI, compared with 6 per cent in the previous quarter, and Microsoft is pleased with customer adoption so far, Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said in an interview.\n\n\"You're seeing healthy growth really across Azure, in the non-AI and AI services, which is important,\" Hood said. \"While of course it's still early in the long-term AI monetization opportunity, we feel good about where we are.\"\n\nMicrosoft's GitHub coding platform is also gaining traction, recording 1.8 million customers during the period, up from 1.3 million last quarter. The AI-coding assistant is powered by OpenAI's large language model and helps streamline developers' work by predicting lines of code, answering questions and converting code from one programming language to another. Corporate subscribers range from small startups to large businesses like Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Ford Motor Co. and Ernst & Young.\n\nThe company is also seeing promising initial uptake for an AI assistant meant to work with its Office software. The new tools cost companies an extra $30 a month on top of existing subscriptions. Nadella told analysts almost 60 per cent of Fortune 500 customers are using the Copilot.\n\nNot everyone reporting earnings on Thursday had good news to share. Intel Corp. gave a lackluster forecast for sales and profit in the current quarter, sending its shares tumbling in extended trading. The chipmaker said it expects business to pick up again in the second half of the year.\n\nMicrosoft and Alphabet needed to deliver a strong performance to avoid spooking investors, who sent shares of Meta Platforms Inc. down Thursday after the Facebook parent said during its Wednesday's earnings that it would invest billions of dollars more than expected on AI. Alphabet spent $12 billion on capital expenditures in the quarter, roughly twice its total from the year-ago quarter, and Porat told investors to expect similar spending for the rest of the year. After investing $14 billion in capital expenditures during the quarter, Microsoft said its spending will continue to rise.\n\n\"We're seeing the AI demand continue to grow, and so we'll continue to work to match that,\" Hood said.",

        "text": "Snapdragon X Elite -- Qualcomm's flagship computer chip that is expected to arrive on laptop from popular brands this year, has been spotted in a benchmark test. A listing for the purported Surface Laptop 6 on Geekbench suggests that Microsoft's upcoming Surface laptop could beat Apple's MacBook Pro models that are powered by its latest M3 chip, in one CPU test. According to recent reports, Microsoft could launch Surface laptops equipped with Snapdragon X Elite chips at a hardware event in May.\n\nThe Surface Laptop 6 was spotted by WCCFTech on Geekbench, without an official product name. It is listed with the title \"OEMBR OEMBR Product Name MFG\" and the details show that it is powered by a Snapdragon 8cx Gen 3 chipset at 4.01GHz, with 12 cores. It's worth noting that there are three Snapdragon X Elite variants, and the one that was benchmarked was not the most powerful chip -- that variant (XIE-84-100) boasts a 4.20GHz boost clock speed.\n\nThe purported Surface Laptop 6 with a Snapdragon X Elite chip has a single-core score of 2,714 points, and a multi-core score of 14,078 points. This puts the chip ahead of Apple's 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro in Geekbench's multi-core tests -- the M3 MacBook Pro scored 3,103 and 12,065 points, respectively.\n\nIf these benchmark tests are genuine, then Apple's M3 chip should be 13.37 percent faster than the Snapdragon X Elite on the rumoured Surface Laptop 6. Meanwhile, Qualcomm's chip is shown to be 15.4 percent faster than the M3 MacBook Pro. After all, the Snapdragon processor has more cores (12) than Apple's M3 chip (8).\n\nIt's worth taking these benchmarks with a grain of salt, as Microsoft is yet to announce any plans to launch new Surface models with Snapdragon laptop chips. According to a recent report, Microsoft is said to be confident that the Surface Pro 10 and Surface Laptop 6 can beat the latest 3nm Apple Silicon processor. We can expect to learn more about these rumoured devices soon -- Microsoft is tipped to introduce new Surface laptops powered by Snapdragon chips at its next hardware event in next month.",

It's barely been a week since the tech giant eluded formal probe by the EU over its complicated relationship with OpenAI. The antitrust regulator established Microsoft's multi-billion dollar investment in the hot startup wasn't an acquisition and didn't have control over its operations, ultimately clearing any looming merger concerns.\n\nAs it happens, Microsoft isn't out of the woods yet. UK-based Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has launched a preliminary investigation. It'll focus on \"Microsoft and Mistral AI, and Amazon and Anthropic, and Microsoft's hiring of former employees and related arrangements with Inflection AI.\"\n\nThe regulator has requested comments from parties with insight into Microsoft's and Amazon's partnership with AI companies. As you may be aware, Microsoft recently got into a new multiyear deal with French startup Mistral AI to further affirm its position in the AI landscape.\n\nAt the time, OpenAI was under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), following last year's fiasco where the board of directors decided to fire and reinstate Sam Altman as CEO under a week.\n\nWhile the EU's investigation on Microsoft didn't warrant a formal probe, the CMA plans to look into the company's \"hiring of former employees and related arrangements with Inflection AI.\" This can be centered on Microsoft's recent reorg, which moved Bing, Edge, and Copilot under its new AI division led by DeepMind and Inflection co-founder Mustafa Suleyman.\n\nRELATED: Microsoft forced to unbundle Teams from its Office 365 package\n\nThe UK-based antitrust watchdog will continue to receive comments on this specific issue till May 9, 2024. It'll use these comments to establish whether Microsoft's partnership falls within UK merger rules or promotes \"anti-competitive\" business practices in the region.\n\nIf found culpable of this offense, the regulator will recommend actions to curate fair business practices for its rivals in the landscape. Unfortunately, this might deter the tech giant from realizing its full potential. Market analysts predict Microsoft is on the brink of reaching its iPhone moment with AI which has already made it rank as the world's most valuable company with over $3 trillion in market capitalization ahead of Apple.",

        "text": "With this power will come a host of new privacy-focused and AI-powered features including better transcription, on-device text summary and improved image editing capabilities.\n\nThese features are unlikely to be part of the updated iPad lineup expected to be revealed at the Let Loose event on May 7, as they will rely on updates to iPadOS and the Apple Silicon chipset not likely to be unveiled until WWDC in June.\n\nWhat can we expect from future iPads?\n\nFuture iPads, likely released in the fall, will have a heavy AI focus thanks to the M4-series of chips that, according to rumor, are designed to be able to run powerful AI loads on device.\n\nHowever, even this generation of iPad makes for a compelling AI device. It is able to run models like Llama 3, handle complex AI tasks such as image generation and video editing and with the camera perform a range of AI vision tasks like those revealed for the new Meta Ray-Bans.\n\nWhat we can expect from Let Loose is updates to the current family of iPads with better screens, the M3 chip and general hardware improvements across the board. Apple will likely brand them as AI capable, or even the best AI tablet on the market.\n\nWhat I'm waiting for is the true AI tablet and I don't think we'll see that this side of the summer if Apple's usual next-generation release schedule is anything to go by.\n\nApple is expected to put the M4 into the iPad and with this a major improvement to the neural engine. Running large language models on a neural engine is more energy efficient and often faster than running it on a GPU.\n\nOn the Mac, Apple has MLX, a new framework designed to make it easier than ever to integrate third-party AI models into the operating system and work with them through apps. I think Apple should make this a core part of a future iPadOS.\n\nThe company has been rumored to be working with companies like Google, Baidu and OpenAI to bring models to the Apple ecosystem and this is likely to make the technology available for developers to integrate into apps without having to rely on sending data to the cloud.\n\n2. Better image editing\n\nAI image editing and image generation has come on significantly since the release of iPadOS 17 last year and Apple has struck a deal to license images from Shutterstock to train a generative AI image model.\n\nWhat I'd like to see is Photos getting a major AI upgrade with the equivalent to Photoshop's generative fill as a core feature. There are already some fun AI image features on the iPad including being able to pop out a person from a background or remove a background.\n\nWith better generative AI integration we could also see the ability to change the orientation or change the canvas size of an image and have AI fill in the missing pieces -- without having to crop to change to landscape or portrait.\n\n3. Better Spotlight\n\nSpotlight is both the best and worst feature on any Apple device. It has the potential to be game changing, especially if Apple integrates generative AI into the workflow.\n\nLook at what The Browser Company has been doing with Arc, including creating content pages on the fly about a particular search topic with the help of AI. This is something Apple could do with Spotlight, including bringing in information on your iCloud files and data.\n\nAn improved Spotlight would make it easier to find content on your iPad, work with that content and even make connections. It could be in the form of a ChatGPT-style chatbot where you use natural language prompts to work with your own content and browse the web.\n\n4. Better Siri\n\nI like Siri a lot more than some people seem to on social media. It gets a bad rap in part because Apple sacrificed some functionality in favor of security and running on-device. With the arrival of improved AI chips and on-board models that problem goes way.\n\nApple should look to what Meta is doing with MetaAI in the Ray-Ban smart glasses as a way to improve how Siri works. It uses on-device processing as well as the cloud, has access to AI vision features to describe the real world and can offer advice.\n\nApple's research team has published a series of new models like Ferret-UI that are capable of understanding what is happening on screen and providing analysis. This could be built into a new Siri to allow for a deeper integration with iCloud and the operating system.\n\n5. Improved customization\n\nApple settled on a layout for apps and said \"good enough\" a few years ago. A few minor tweaks such as the addition of widgets aside, it really hasn't changed much since version one. For me, that isn't much of a problem as it works -- but what if AI could give everyone a layout that works for them?\n\nBringing together many of the other feature ideas, generative AI and natural language prompts could make it easier than ever to customize every aspect of your iPad from the shape of icons to where they are positioned on the screen.\n\nIt could allow you to generate wallpaper from a text prompt and create widgets based on the output of multiple apps instead of having one widget per app. This could also then be integrated into the new-look Spotlight and allow you to change settings by typing something like \"automatically make the screen darker at 9pm every night.\"\n\nHow likely are these changes?\n\nWhile I think some of this will happen, particularly around GenAI in photos, an improved Siri and deeper integration of AI into the operating system -- some of it will be from developers not Apple.\n\nThere are rumors of an AI App Store coming and Apple is likely to create a new suite of APIs and developer kits that app makers can use to get the most out of the power of the M4.\n\nWe might see some high profile third-party integration like Adobe running GenAI locally in Photoshop or Express for iPad. We also might see Apple's own apps get an AI upgrade including text completion in Pages or AI editing in iMovie -- but the deeper system changes might have to wait until iPadOS 19.\n\nMore from Tom's Guide",

        "text": "From the likes of Apple to Coca-Cola, Heineken to the New York Lottery and Reporters Without Borders, this week's global spread of creative ads has a little bit of everything, writes LBB's Nisna Mahtani\n\nTaking us on a journey across the world, to India, Germany, the UK, South Africa and even to the city of New York, this week's global spread of work is bursting with creativity.\n\nKicking off the list is Apple's locally-made spot, leaning into the Indian cricket season and showing the audience just how durable its products are. We're then taken across to Germany, where Reporters Without Borders reminds us of some of the speeches political leaders have made, how their initial promises don't always align with their terms in office and why the free press can help combat that.\n\nFrom there, we take a relaxing barrel-roll walk through Seville with Heineken, witness a hectic journey across New York with The New York State Lottery and even listen out for the 'Coke SoundZ' coming from the famous fizzy drink brand.\n\nTo top it all off, we finished our journey how we should have started, with a safety briefing from travel brand TUI. Check it all out here:\n\nApple's latest campaign is based in India and marks its first locally-made film, 'Relax, it's iPhone' in collaboration with TBWA\\ Media Arts Lab Singapore. Timed to coincide with the Indian Premier League (IPL) season, the campaign showcases how the iPhone 15 can survive the auto rickshaw journey through busy streets. As the iPhone 15 undergoes a rigorous durability test, bouncing around in the back of a the vehicle, it isn't even phased with a scratch.\n\nOn the occasion of its 30th anniversary, Reporters Without Borders Germany (RSF) worked with Innocean Berlin and Stink Films Berlin to create 'The First Speech'. The three part campaign takes the audience across Russia, Türkiye and Venezuela as political leaders' speeches are heard by the local population. Each speech is filled with pretty promises about safeguarding freedom and democracy, all of which the leaders have failed to uphold, thus the organisation is encouraging people to \"Trust the Free Press. Not Pretty Words\".\n\nTraversing the streets of Seville, in a relaxed but highly unusual way, is how we're being introduced to Heineken's Sevillian lager Cruzcampo®. Working together with Lucky Generals, the lager beer brand is embracing all things chill, cool and composed in this spot. With the UK market ready to embrace authentic Spanish beers, the Cruzcampo® brand originated in Span in 1904 and remains to be a firm favourite for locals who enjoy a slower way of life. Now for the Brits to get on board!\n\nThe New York Lottery drops new Scratch-Off Games every month, but in this latest ad with McCann New York, they're releasing a cash ticket with an eyebrow-raising $10,000,000 up for grabs. Tapping into the so-true-it's-funny reality that New Yorkers encounter the 'unbelievable' on a daily basis, the three spots showcase just how wacky things can get in the concrete jungle where dreams are made of. So much so that these prizes might very well be the last thing left that can actually surprise a New Yorker.\n\nPhst. Fizz. Clink. Glug. Did you hear that? That's the sound of Coca-Cola's latest ad.\n\nCelebrating Coca-Cola Zero Sugar's unique sounds, the 'Coke SoundZ' instrument campaign from WPP Open X, led by AKQA, turned these noises into a Coca-Cola bottle shaped instrument to create tracks with. The multisensory experience combines sound capture with AI and behavioural psychology to \"spark joy with every note,\" according to the Coca-Cola Company's VP and head of generative AI Pratik Thakar. Take a look and see for yourself.\n\n\"How far would you go for what you love?\" Asks the latest KFC campaign from Nice Shirt Films' director Kim Geldenhuys. Featuring the location of Marion Island - the science facility home to a South African National Antarctic Programme - it shows how people who are stationed 2000km away from the nearest KFC will travel back just for a taste of a Finger Lickin' good meal. Set to a jazz cover of 'Comin' Home Baby', it's a spot with that classic South African humour and heart behind it.\n\nGetting on a plane and starting to watch a movie, only to be interrupted by those pesky safety videos - we've all been there. But this time, in this safety briefing from global travel and leisure company TUI, there's a bit of a twist. Working with Leo Burnett UK, 'Safety: A Global Film' celebrates all the favourite TUI destinations, while offering an entertaining alternative to the traditional safety briefing. From ancient Egyptian tombs à la Indiana Jones to Kill Bill-esque Chinese temples, the four-minute film makes you actually pay attention to the safety briefing.",

Both showed Huawei with market share of about 17 percent.\n\nThe other brands in the top five are OPPO, Apple, and Vivo.\n\nAfter two year's in which sales declined, the domestic market saw a rebound of 6.5 percent with sales of 69.3 million units in the quarter, according to the IDC.\n\nHuawei's resurgence can be attributed the success of the Mate 60 Pro, Huawei's flagship phone launched in late 2023. This premium device boasts an in-house Kirin chip, a powerful processor that was previously unavailable due to US sanctions. The return of the Kirin chipset instilled confidence in loyal Huawei users, offering them a familiar and trusted experience.\n\nThat market recovery allowed Huawei to seize market share and quickly reclaim lost ground. The production and supply shortage of the Mate 60 series improved in the first quarter, propelling it to become the key driver of Huawei's overall growth. In addition to the high-end lineup, Huawei released the nova 12 series in December, which features Harmony 4.0, expanding the Kirin chipset to more product lines and successfully boosting performance in the mid-range price band, said Canalys senior analyst Toby Zhu.\n\nIn April, Huawei also launched the long-awaited Pura 70, featuring an innovative pop-out camera lens, further sparking market interest.",

        "text": "This article was originally published in German and has been automatically translated.\n\nIt's not long now until Apple's first keynote of the year: on March 7, there will finally be another Apple event. New rumors about the products to be unveiled have now emerged in the run-up to the event. Interestingly, CEO Tim Cook is also involved - with a post on X.\n\nDespite rumors to the contrary, Apple will apparently not be using a mini LED screen, as previously known from the iPad Pro, for the iPad Air, which will reportedly be released in two variants for the first time - including a new one with a 12.9-inch display. It was previously said that the new, larger model would have the particularly bright screen technology. The information had only been spread by well-known display analyst Ross Young last week - according to him, the mini-LED display from the 12.9-inch iPad Pro would move to the Air. But now Young, who runs the consultancy Display Supply Chain Consultants (DSCC), has changed his mind. In an X-Posting for subscribers, he stated that he no longer expects this because the costs for the panel are too high for Apple.\n\nHe had been told this by \"several sources in the supply chain\". Accordingly, both new iPad Air models, i.e. the 10.9 and 12.9-inch versions, will continue to use normal standard LCD panels. It is rather unlikely that Apple has changed its mind at short notice - apparently Young's initial statement was incorrect. However, he also wrote that it is conceivable that a new iPad with a 12.9-inch mini-LED screen could be released \"in the fourth quarter of 2024\". But that would be a completely new variant, which doesn't really fit either, as Apple already has a rather confusing range of tablets with a standard iPad, iPad mini, iPad Air and iPad Pro.\n\nMeanwhile, Apple CEO Tim Cook has also contributed to speculation about the \"Let loose\" keynote. In his official post on the event invitation, he not only showed an animation of several Apple logos apparently created with Apple Pencil, but also wrote that Apple should be entered in the calendar for May 7, which means \"Pencil us in for May 7\". Pencil, in turn, is the name of Apple's own stylus. Cook also added an emoji with a pencil. A stylus can also be seen in the official Keynote Apple logo (see above).\n\nIn addition to new iPad Airs, new iPad Pro models with an OLED screen for the first time, a new Pencil with a \"squeeze\" gesture and a new Magic Keyboard variant with an aluminum housing are also expected. Another interesting question is whether Apple will use the date to announce the European launch of the Vision Pro. Analysts claim that the company could do with a sales boost for the mixed reality headset. Somewhat wilder speculation also suggests that Apple could announce the Pencil as an additional input device for the Vision Pro.",

This will lead to clouds, but the air above 5000 feet will be especially dry, keeping any significant rain away.\n\nWarmer air building across the Midwest will begin to advance toward Virginia on Saturday. The leading edge of the warmer air -- a warm front -- will spread more clouds into the state, but the true warmer air will be about a day away.

Once that window for rain closes, a dry, but cooler period follows for Friday and Saturday, with afternoons in the upper 60s or 70s.\n\nBut the total amount of rain ahead for the state is small. Many locations may not have any rain at all over the next seven days.\n\nMost of the state has been drier than normal in April. We do need to be mindful of a legitimate drought developing during the next couple of weeks. Central North Carolina is already drier than Virginia, and we should expect that dry area to expand northward into Virginia in the next week or two.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nAlthough the most intense heat of summer is still a couple of months away, it is important to remember that a dry ground leads to higher temperatures during the summer. The reason for this is relatively intuitive.\n\nAll else being equal, when the ground is moist, the daytime energy from the sun goes into warming and drying the soil. Therefore, when the ground is dry, all of that energy goes into raising the temperatures of the ground rather than evaporating its moisture.\n\nVegetated land -- from grass to trees -- also helps keep the ground cooler, as green plants are absorbing solar energy during photosynthesis. This is another one of the reasons that arid climates west of the Mississippi River can more easily get above 100 degrees in the summer compared to Virginia.\n\nAlso concerning, there is additional evidence to suggest this summer will be hotter than average. On top of the background warming climate, the Pacific Ocean near the equator is likely headed into a La Niña pattern, meaning the water there is cooler than normal. That transition often correlates to hotter than average summers in Virginia, although the correlation is not a dominant one.\n\nThe warming climate signal becomes more obvious when recent summer temperatures in Virginia are examined, as most summers have been hotter than average in the last 20 years.\n\nIn Richmond, the average summer temperature since monthly records began in 1880 is 77.3 degrees. It has been 20 years since we had a summer below that average, holding at 76.2 degrees in 2004. Since that time, Richmond has had 7 of its hottest 10 summers on record, including the only time the average temperature for the entire season was above 80 degrees: 2010.\n\nMost of this rise comes via the jump in overnight low temperatures versus an increase in explicitly hot days. Summer humidity climbs as the climate warms, keeping the air from cooling as much at night. There is also a secondary impact from the urban heat island effect, but the rise in overnight low temperatures is seen in rural, suburban, and urban settings, so it is not the primary cause.\n\nEither way, enjoy the cooler break Friday and Saturday while we have it. A long, hot Virginia summer is right around the corner.\n\nFrom the archives: 100 photos of Pony Pasture Tags Weather Weekend Virginia Sublette Cool Warm Sean Sublette\n\nMeteorologist\n\nAuthor facebook Author linkedin Author twitter Author email Follow Sean Sublette Close Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!

        "text": "This article may contain personal views and opinion from the author. After giving up on its self-driving car ambitions, Apple may have shifted focus towards another future technology (besides the Vision Pro) - home robots!\n\nIn addition, we know that Apple is planning some huge AI updates for Siri, and its devices in general - generative AI, powered by none other than... Google's Gemini.\n\nReports say that the two companies are currently trying to strike a deal, and if successful, this could mean a lot of new things for us, the consumers.\n\nWe're well aware of Siri's upcoming major updates, but what about that Apple robot? What kind of a robot will it be, would Google's Gemini AI power it, and... well, do you need such a thing? Let's talk about it...\n\nApple's Siri isn't known for being the most intelligent assistant out there, falling quite a bit short behind the competition, in fact. But on the plus side, we could always praise it for being privacy-oriented.\n\nGoogle, however, would gladly take in all the private data it can, from all of its users, in order to train and improve its AI, and services.\n\nThat was my first thought after finding out Apple would not be making its own AI, but licensing Google's - it wasn't a positive one.\n\nSee, the moment Apple starts relying on Google for something as major as generative AI, likely to be implemented in all of its devices and most of its apps, we - the consumers - are no longer just relying on Apple to protect and respect our privacy.\n\nSuddenly Google's all in on our private data too, just like it is with Android users, and one of Apple's biggest aces in the hole - privacy, provided by a single entity - will no longer be a realistic selling point.\n\nSo I'm expecting this Apple-Google deal to either fall apart, or for the two companies to sign an unprecedented agreement that would cost the fruit-logo company billions. Generative AI needs lots of servers, lots of processing, and maintenance.\n\nWould this cost also trickle down to the users, in the form of more expensive Apple products, or monthly subscription services? We'll see soon enough...\n\nIn any case, let's focus on that potential Apple robot that may be powered by Google's Gemini. What would it look like?\n\nWhile I admire the Apple Vision Pro's potential and ambitions, the technology isn't there yet, generally. The same applies to humanoid home robots, which is the only kind of Apple robot I think would be exciting and useful for the trillion dollar company to make.\n\nA humanoid robot that can cook, wash the dishes, watch the house, walk the dog... Yeah, this is pretty far into the future. Our closest glimpse at such a sophisticated machine would be Tesla's Optimus robot, and, perhaps more realistically - the Figure One robot, which you can check out below:\n\nAs impressive as it is, in terms of AI - being able to see, analyze, reason, make correct assumptions, and act accordingly, without human guidance - only the software side of this is currently accessible to the average person. Yes, we have pretty amazing artificial intelligence now - fantastic!\n\nHowever, by the time the hardware aspect of this concept matures, improves, becomes more compact and affordable enough to be sold to consumers, we'd probably be 10 or 20 years older than we are right now.\n\nI can't imagine Apple has some magical way to crank up a dream humanoid robot faster. It's already proven, with the Apple Vision Pro, that despite its trillions of dollars, Apple is still as limited by current technology as any other company. It can only go so far.\n\nWith that in mind, we're more likely going to get an Amazon Astro-like robot with Siri (and its upcoming Google Gemini intelligence), wheeling around the house...\n\nBut do we really need that? We all have phones with the same technology, besides the wheeling, and many of us are also stocked up on smart speakers...\n\nAccording to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, who's been a reliable Apple leaker for years now, Apple began looking for its next future tech project around the time its self-driving Apple Car didn't pan out.\n\nThe company is quietly exploring and testing a home robot, with a design similar to Amazon Astro's, which is basically a tablet on wheels. Or if you want to be quirky about it, in this case - an iPad on a Roomba.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, I'm not exactly hyped on the idea, nor are most people, judging by how unpopular such products are, despite having existed for years.\n\nThe reason they're unpopular can be attributed to their limited functionality, which can easily be covered by a smart speaker, or something akin to Google's Nest Hub.\n\nBecause Amazon Astro-like robots rely on wheels, they can't actually navigate most people's homes due to simple obstructions like the threshold between two rooms. Even if they can navigate in a theoretical, perfectly flat and accessible house or apartment, those robots can't really do much.\n\nIf you put a can of coke in their tray, they can move it around, but that's not really solving a problem. They can't actually take it out of the fridge and bring it to you, which would've actually been useful.\n\nSo you end up with a smart assistant wheeling around and attempting to follow and face you, but is that really so much better than just using your smartphone or smart speakers?\n\nI suppose we'll have to wait and see. Maybe Apple will surprise us with a new twist on this idea, or maybe this whole \"Apple robot\" concept will get canned in favor of something else, like a stronger focus on the Vision Pro.\n\nIn any case, what are your thoughts on it? Would you prefer a cutesy, wheeling Apple robot in your home, or in a distant future - would you rather have a full, humanoid Apple robot doing your chores? Or, you know - neither?",

        "text": "HMD's high price tag for their flagship devices and lackluster phones that didn't keep up with the user's demands steered Nokia as a brand to its final demise.\n\nIf there's one smartphone brand people will remember for generations, it is Nokia. The Finnish company that once \"Connected people\" and was at the pinnacle of mobile phone technology and innovations died a gruesome death, with the brand \"Nokia\" dying a few more deaths in the same decade. Nokia has completely lost its value now with even the brand's latest owners, HMD Global, ditching the branding in favor of their own with their new Pulse series of devices.\n\nThe Nokia fiasco isn't just one bad decision, but a series of bad decisions that led to the brand's downfall. We shall look at all of them briefly in this article, or should I say, \"DOs and DON'Ts of running a Smartphone Business 101: A Brief Guide.\"\n\nMany blame the Windows Phone for the beloved Finnish manufacturer's failure, but the company died a death even before working with Microsoft.\n\nFollowing the success of the original iPhone, other brands quickly adopted touchscreen input for their phones. However, Nokia stuck to releasing phones with a qwerty keyboard. Even when it did launch touchscreen devices, it slapped a sliding qwerty keyboard at the back. This half-baked commitment resulted in poor sales.\n\nThey finally created a proper touchscreen device in the form of the Nokia N8 in 2011. However, it was too late by then, as other brands had already established themselves. N8 could have still succeeded if only it didn't come with Nokia's in-house Symbian OS. But for some reason, Nokia kept using Symbian instead of switching over to Android early on.\n\nSymbian was clunky and lacked proper app support, unlike Android and iOS. This rigidity towards change led to their first death.\n\nIn a desperate attempt to catch up to the market, Nokia then partnered with Microsoft to exclusively ship their smartphone with the Windows Phone platform. This new lineup would sell under the Lumia banner. Nokia also merged its services with Microsoft. Like Bing Search would show results for Nokia Maps. Yes, Nokia had their Map service, and it was better than Apple's.\n\nThis deal did seem fruitful. Nokia's hardware coupled with Windows Phone looked ahead of its time with Live tiles and a metro theme. Nokia's camera science was also remarkable. Not only that, Nokia released some exciting budget devices like the Lumia 520, which I owned and which was one of its highest-selling devices. The colorful options Lumia phones came in were also a stark contrast to the dull black, gray, and white smartphones available at the time.\n\nPeople were getting warm to the platform. However, there was a severe lack of apps that people wanted at the time in the Microsoft Marketplace. WhatsApp took a while to come to the platform, Snapchat was absent and Instagram rarely received any updates. This gap led to people alienating the platform again.\n\nBy 2014, Microsoft had acquired Nokia for $7.2 Billion, which cemented that we would only see Windows Phone from the brand. But, I guess Nokia realized that the platform wouldn't last long and surprisingly released a series of Android smartphones as the Nokia X series. This was a weird step for the company that earlier refused to adopt Android.\n\nThe news of a Nokia device running on Android made fans quite happy, but this happiness wouldn't last long. See, the Nokia X phones were an amalgamation of Android, Windows, and their MeeGo devices. It used Android, but the interface was similar to Windows Phone while featuring settings from MeeGo like the Fastlane page. It also didn't have the Google Play Store. Instead, you had to sideload your favorite Android apps. Simply put, this endeavor was a complete failure.\n\nBy 2015, even Microsoft couldn't ignore the lack of apps on their platform. So they had an ingenious idea of developing a platform that combines the mobile and desktop operating systems. It was eventually called Windows 10 Mobile. The idea was, desktop apps made for Windows 10 will also be usable on the mobile version. The concept was great, but its execution wasn't.\n\nWindows 10 Mobile was riddled with bugs and performance issues from the get-go. What was once a smooth-running platform, started to lag heavily, even on the most powerful devices. Coupled with crashes and a downgrade in design, you have a recipe for disaster.\n\nMichael Fischer's review of the Lumia 950 XL that shipped with Windows 10 Mobile was titled \"Nope\". He highlighted all the issues that plagued the flagship device of the Lumia series. Suffice it to say that even the most hardcore Windows Phone fans couldn't defend this platform.\n\nAny goodwill Nokia branded Windows Phones had at the time drowned when those phones received this update.\n\nIn 2014, the Finnish giant \"Home of Nokia Mobile Devices\" sold the Nokia brand to Microsoft. Microsoft, in 2016, sold the rights to use the Nokia brand name to HMD Global (Human Mobile Devices) which was founded by former Nokia executive Jean-Francois Baril.\n\nA year after the acquisition, it was clear that Nokia would be purely focusing on Android. This led to their first release.\n\nNokia, rather HMD Global, launched the first true Nokia Android phone - the Nokia 6. The initial impressions were okay-ish. One of the highlights of the phones and the Nokia phones that followed was Android One, meaning the devices would run stock Android and get 2 major software updates. This was a big deal back in the day when Android manufacturers would push one update and give up on any further development for their devices.\n\nAndroid One, followed by Nokia's great build quality and even better device launches like the Nokia 6.1, 6.1 Plus, 5.1 Plus, 7 Plus (which our Editor owned back in the day and adored for its build), and a few others gained HMD Global a good reputation.\n\nHowever, at the same time, we saw HMD was consistently overpricing its flagships like the Nokia 8, 8 Sirocco, and Nokia 9 PureView. And the phones weren't even that good. Sure, HMD's Nokia mid-range devices were more expensive than others, but Nokia's flagships were more expensive than what they offered.\n\nUnfortunately, the new HMD-backed Nokia period was short-lived as other Android manufacturers caught up in terms of updates, stayed up to date with the trends, and improved their software skins.\n\nHMD, on the other hand, didn't adapt or step up its efforts. The company continued offering similar low-specced, expensive devices with two years of Android updates. They also were reluctant to adapt to the latest innovations, be it slimmer bezels, faster charging, or higher megapixel cameras in their Nokia phones. Furthermore, the company struggled to adhere to its promises as the updates were mostly delayed with the brand shying away from pushing even major promised updates to phones that were supposed to get them.\n\nTo add insult to injury, the updates were riddled with bugs, rendering the device unusable. For example, as soon as the Android 12 update was available to Nokia 8.3 owners, there were reports of bricked devices. What ended HMD's motivation was its inability to push the Android 11 update to its flagship device, the Nokia 9 PureView.\n\nHMD offered discounts to Nokia 9 PureView users on other Nokia smartphones to apologize for the same. But that was handled poorly, and unsurprisingly, no one took the offer, another major reason why people's trust lifted from Nokia.\n\nAs of writing this, HMD Global still has a few Nokia devices in its portfolio like the Nokia G42, C32, and C22 in India, and they aren't anything to write home about. They announced back in MWC that they would drop the \"Nokia\" branding completely.\n\nAs expected, HMD recently launched its Pulse series of smartphones. At first glance, they look far from interesting and are outdated as per 2024 standards with HD displays, Unisoc SoC, and a higher price than what other manufacturers are charging for phones with better specifications. They seem to be Chinese knock-offs with the HMD branding.\n\nAs someone who loved using Nokia phones before, I'm glad these HMD devices aren't Nokia-branded because in no way do these represent the innovation previous Nokia devices brought to the table.\n\nThe reason we feel HMD Global didn't do well is due to their inability to adapt, which is unironically the same reason why Nokia died two deaths prior to its recent one. The lack of innovative ideas and getting a bit too comfortable with what they were doing is what led to Nokia's ultimate death.\n\nNokia, a brand that meant quality and innovation, is now dead. Sadly, those days are far behind in the rear view mirror to even see them and new names like Xiaomi and Moto, have taken the brand's place. If only the brand adopted Android earlier or if Microsoft managed to bring more developers on board to develop apps for its platform, it could have thrived. But alas, I think the current reality is that the brand has been put to rest for the best.\n\nThe smartphone market these days is just way more competitive than it used to be a decade ago. Competitiveness drives innovations left and right but it's impossible to survive with the mindset of Nokia and its later parent firms.\n\nHave you used Nokia phones before? Share with us your cherished memories of your favorite Nokia devices and insights on what else the brand could've done to survive.",

        "text": "The war between Apple and Spotify seems to have no end. The two large companies have been locked in an eternal legal battle that is going on too long. Spotify wants to skip App Store commissions. For its part, Apple does not approve app updates.\n\nIn fact, at the end of 2022 Apple had already rejected Spotify's update up to three times and today continues to ignore all the music platform's efforts to circumvent App Store rules.\n\nThe latest Spotify updates incorporated information about subscription prices for your plans and links to the Spotify website.\n\nDespite all the regulations carried out by the European Commission, Apple still does not allow Spotify certain movements with its iPhone application. The European organization sanctioned Apple with a financial fine and ordered remove all bans that prevented music streaming apps from reporting rate prices or including links to their websites.\n\nAfter the release of iOS 17.4, alternative payment methods are now accepted in the App Store. But with one small condition, the Cupertino firm has managed to make all applications that include links to services have to pay a 27% commission to Apple.\n\nTherefore, if Spotify includes links in its app and a user uses them to subscribe to its services, Spotify would have to pay a commission of 27% of the price of that subscription to Apple. Of course, Spotify doesn't want to pay Apple. So from the apple firm they simply ignore the updates to the music service.\n\nSpotify's latest update includes minimal details on tariff pricing and a mention for users to purchase services through the platform's official website. But it does not contain links.\n\nApple has responded to Spotify through the App Store:\n\n\"Apple has created a music streaming service license for iOS and iPadOS. This license allows apps to add buttons, external links, and other calls to action to direct their customers to a purchasing mechanism or website. You must accept these terms before adding these features to your application.\"\n\nOf course, the moment Spotify accepts these terms it will be legally forced to pay App Store commissions.

        "text": "Full customisation and personalisation for tables and your real-time data\n\n(Reuters) - A U.S. Federal Reserve meeting and Apple and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) reporting results will keep investors' focus in the days ahead on the global rates outlook and on tech earnings, while growth and inflation data from Europe and China are also coming out.\n\nHere's what to expect in the coming days, from Rae Wee in Singapore, Lewis Krauskopf in New York and Amanda Cooper and Naomi Rovnick in London.\n\n1/ WILL THEY, WON'T THEY? Hints of whether the Fed still expects interest rate cuts at some point this year takes centre-stage for investors at the central bank's meeting that concludes on Wednesday. Rate action is unlikely, but comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell about the potential for policy easing later in 2024 will be scrutinized. In March, the Fed projected three rate cuts this year but stronger-than-expected inflation reports are casting doubt on whether it will be able to ease policy that much - and that soon. A ratcheting down of rate cut expectations has been a key factor behind the rise in Treasury yields and recent pullback in stocks. Fed futures markets now predict some 35 bps of easing in 2024 down from 150 bps expected at the start of the year.\n\n2/ TECH TALK The last of the \"Magnificent Seven\" megacaps that drove a fiery stock rally in 2023 to report are Amazon, reporting Tuesday, and Apple, on Thursday.\n\nSome of their peers such as Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) and Facebook parent Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META ) have given a mixed performance.\n\nApple shares (NASDAQ: AAPL ) have lost their lustre in 2024, tumbling over 10%. The iPhone maker is expected to post a decline in first quarter earnings after China smartphone shipments fell 19%.\n\nAmazon's cloud computing business will be in focus while investors will be attuned to the online retailing giant's view of consumer spending. Its shares are faring better so far this year, having risen 18% as of Wednesday. Meanwhile, tech regulation is also on the front burner. President Joe Biden just signed legislation that bans TikTok in the United States if Chinese owner ByteDance fails to divest the short video app over the next nine months to a year.\n\n3/ RAY OF HOPE\n\nFollowing last month's upside surprises on manufacturing activity in China, April's readings are set to indicate whether the long-awaited economic recovery is indeed gathering steam.\n\nOfficial figures for China's purchasing managers' index (PMI) are due on Tuesday and the Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI survey is expected shortly afterwards.\n\nUpbeat data could revive animal spirits in the world's second largest economy, bringing relief to policymakers who have been trying to shore up growth and bolster investor sentiment.\n\nGlobal investment houses have turned increasingly bullish on Chinese stocks, helping the blue-chip index tack on more than 10% from a February trough. But Beijing has lately found itself in a bind over its currency. The yuan is sliding against a perky dollar but is stronger against its major trading partners - an unwelcome sign for China's export-reliant economy.\n\n4/ PAVING THE WAY\n\nEuro zone inflation and economic growth data due out on Tuesday could strengthen market bets for the European Central Bank to lower its deposit rate from a record 4% in June, although policy makers are not expected to move very fast thereafter. Gross domestic product in the euro zone currency bloc probably expanded by just 0.1% in the first quarter, year-on-year, economists polled by Reuters expect the data to show. April inflation numbers could also convince the ECB it's time to cut, after consumer price growth slowed unexpectedly to 2.4% in March and policymakers signalled that the central bank was willing to move.\n\nBut with U.S. inflation running hot and the Fed viewed as likely to hold rates high, markets price 60 bps of cuts by the ECB this year as it remains wary of the euro weakening too much against a supercharged dollar.\n\n5/ SELL IN MAY\n\nConventional wisdom has it that May is the ideal point to take profit on equities and lay low until later in the year.\n\n\"Sell in May and go away\" is based on the premise that the best six-month period for stock market returns is November to April, while the leanest is May to October. Over the last 50 years, the S&P 500 has gained an average of 4.8% between November and April, and just 1.2% between May and October, according to Reuters calculations.\n\nHowever, this pattern fades over a shorter time-frame.\n\nOver the last 20 years, the out-performance of November-April over May-October narrows to 1%. Over 10 years, November-April has underperformed May-October by 1 percentage point and over the last five years, it has underperformed by 3 percentage points.\n\nIt might be time to find words that rhyme with \"November\".\n\n(Graphics by Kripa Jayaram, Sumanta Sen, Vineet Sachdev and Amanda Cooper, Compiled by Karin Strohecker; Editing by Gareth Jones)",

Critics, however, argue data storage is only part of the problem, and that the algorithm must be disconnected from ByteDance.\n\nEven if a sale were to go through, it would be unlikely that the algorithm would be included. A recent Chinese law designated such algorithms as protected technology after former US President Donald Trump attempted to ban TikTok in 2020.\n\nTikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew said the social media company would put up a legal fight in court against the US law calling for its divestment from Chinese ownership, describing the law as a \"ban.\"\n\nThe newly signed law, which was passed through Congress in conjunction with a large-scale military aid bill for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, gives Chinese owner ByteDance nine months to sell the app, with a potential three-month extension if a sale was underway.\n\nUnder the law, ByteDance would have to sell the app or be excluded from Apple and Google's app stores in the United States.\n\nTikTok is likely to challenge the bill on the basis of the First Amendment, which guarantees the right to freedom of speech, while some of TikTok's 170 million US users are also expected to take legal action.\n\nUS and other Western officials have claimed the social media platform allows Chinese authorities to collect data, spy on users and act as a conduit to spread propaganda. Beijing and ByteDance have both denied the allegations.\n\nA number of Chinese national security laws compel organizations to assist with intelligence gathering.\n\nTikTok has denied that it could be used as a tool for the Chinese government or that it has ever shared US user data with Chinese authorities, vowing never to do so even if asked.",

        "text": "NEW YORK: At its peak in the early 2000s, Photobucket was the world's top image-hosting site. The media backbone for once-hot services like Myspace and Friendster, it boasted 70 million users and accounted for nearly half of the US online photo market.\n\nToday only two million people still use Photobucket, according to analytics tracker Similarweb. But the generative AI revolution may give it a new lease of life.\n\nCEO Ted Leonard, who runs the 40-strong company out of Edwards, Colorado, told Reuters he is in talks with multiple tech companies to license Photobucket's 13 billion photos and videos to be used to train generative AI models that can produce new content in response to text prompts.\n\nHe has discussed rates of between 5 cents and US$1 (RM4.70) per photo and more than US$1 (RM4.70) per video, he said, with prices varying widely both by the buyer and the types of imagery sought.\n\n\"We've spoken to companies that have said, 'we need way more',\" Leonard added, with one buyer telling him they wanted over a billion videos, more than his platform has.\n\n\"You scratch your head and say, where do you get that?\"\n\nPhotobucket declined to identify its prospective buyers, citing commercial confidentiality. The ongoing negotiations, which haven't been previously reported, suggest the company could be sitting on billions of dollars' worth of content and give a glimpse into a bustling data market that's arising in the rush to dominate generative AI technology.\n\nTech giants like Google, Meta and Microsoft-backed OpenAI initially used reams of data scraped from the Internet for free to train generative AI models like ChatGPT that can mimic human creativity. They have said that doing so is both legal and ethical, though they face lawsuits from a string of copyright holders over the practice.\n\nAt the same time, these tech companies are also quietly paying for content locked behind paywalls and login screens, giving rise to a hidden trade in everything from chat logs to long forgotten personal photos from faded social media apps.\n\n\"There is a rush right now to go for copyright holders that have private collections of stuff that is not available to be scraped,\" said Edward Klaris from law firm Klaris Law, which says it's advising content owners on deals worth tens of millions of dollars apiece to license archives of photos, movies and books for AI training.\n\nReuters spoke to more than 30 people with knowledge of AI data deals, including current and former executives at companies involved, lawyers and consultants, to provide the first in-depth exploration of this fledgling market - detailing the types of content being bought, the prices materialising, plus emerging concerns about the risk of personal data making its way into AI models without people's knowledge or explicit consent.\n\nOpenAI, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Apple and Amazon all declined to comment on specific data deals and discussions for this article, although Microsoft and Google referred Reuters to supplier codes of conduct that include data-privacy provisions.\n\nGoogle added that it would \"take immediate action, up to and including termination\" of its agreement with a supplier if it discovered a violation.\n\nMany major market research firms say they have not even begun to estimate the size of the opaque AI data market, where companies often don't disclose agreements. Those researchers who do, such as Business Research Insights, put the market at roughly US$2.5bil (RM11.92bil) now and forecast it could grow close to US$30bil (RM143.14bil) within a decade.\n\nGenerative data gold rush\n\nThe data land grab comes as makers of big generative AI \"foundation\" models face increasing pressure to account for the massive amounts of content they feed into their systems, a process known as \"training\" that requires intensive computing power and often takes months to complete.\n\nTech companies say the technology would be cost-prohibitive if they couldn't use vast archives of free scraped web page data, such as those provided by non-profit repository Common Crawl, which they describe as \"publicly available\".\n\nTheir approach has nonetheless drawn a wave of copyright lawsuits and regulatory heat, while prompting publishers to add code to their websites to block scraping.\n\nIn response, AI model makers have started hedging risks and securing data-supply chains, both through deals with content owners and via a burgeoning industry of data brokers that has popped up to satisfy demand.\n\nIn the months after ChatGPT debuted in late 2022, for instance, companies including Meta, Google, Amazon and Apple all struck agreements with stock image provider Shutterstock to use hundreds of millions of images, videos and music files in its library for training, according to a person familiar with the arrangements.\n\nThe deals with Big Tech firms initially ranged from US$25mil (RM119.28mil) to US$50mil (RM238.57mil) each, though most were later expanded, Shutterstock's chief financial officer Jarrod Yahes told Reuters. Smaller tech players have followed suit, spurring a fresh \"flurry of activity\" in the past two months, he added.\n\nYahes declined to comment on individual contracts. The Apple agreement, and the size of the other deals, haven't previously been made public.\n\nA Shutterstock competitor, Freepik, told Reuters it had struck agreements with two large tech companies to license the majority of its archive of 200 million images at 2 to 4 cents per image. There are five more similar deals in the pipeline, said CEO Joaquin Cuenca Abela, declining to identify buyers.\n\nOpenAI, an early Shutterstock customer, has also signed licensing agreements with at least four news organisations, including The Associated Press and Axel Springer. Thomson Reuters, the owner of Reuters News, separately said it has struck deals to license news content to help train AI large language models, but didn't disclose details.\n\n'Ethically sourced' content\n\nAn industry of dedicated AI data firms is emerging too, securing rights to real-world content like podcasts, short-form videos and interactions with digital assistants, while also building networks of short-term contract workers to produce custom visuals and voice samples from scratch, akin to an Uber-esque gig economy for data.\n\nSeattle-based Defined.ai licenses data to a range of companies including Google, Meta, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft, CEO Daniela Braga told Reuters.\n\nRates vary by buyer and content type, but Braga said companies are generally willing to pay US$1 (RM4.70) to US$2 (RM9.54) per image, US$2 (RM9.54) to US$4 (RM19) per short-form video and US$100 (RM477) to US$300 (RM1,431) per hour of longer films. The market rate for text is US$0.001 per word, she added.\n\nImages of nudity, which require the most sensitive handling, go for US$5 (RM23.80) to US$7 (RM33.40), she said.\n\nDefined.ai splits those earnings with content providers, Braga said. It markets its datasets as \"ethically sourced\", as it obtains consent from people whose data it uses and strips out personally identifying information, she added.\n\nOne of the firm's suppliers, a Brazil-based entrepreneur, said he pays owners of the photos, podcasts and medical data he sources about 20% to 30% of total deal amounts.\n\nThe priciest images in his portfolio are those used to train AI systems that block content like graphic violence barred by the tech companies, said the supplier, who spoke on condition his company wasn't identified, citing commercial sensitivity.\n\nTo fulfill those requests, he obtains images of crime scenes, conflict violence and surgeries - mainly from police, freelance photojournalists and medical students, respectively - often in places in South America and Africa where distributing graphic images is more common, he said.\n\nHe said he has received images from freelance photographers in Gaza since the start of the war there in October, plus some from Israel at the outset of hostilities.\n\nHis company hires nurses accustomed to seeing violent injuries to anonymise and annotate the images, which are disturbing to untrained eyes, he added.\n\n'I would find it risky'\n\nWhile licensing could resolve some legal and ethical issues, resurrecting the archives of old Internet names like Photobucket as fuel for the latest AI models raises others, particularly around user privacy, according to many of the industry players interviewed.\n\nAI systems have been caught regurgitating exact copies of their training data, spitting out, for example, the Getty Images watermark, verbatim paragraphs of New York Times articles and images of real people. That means a person's private photos or intimate thoughts posted decades ago could potentially wind up in generative AI outputs without notice or explicit consent.\n\nPhotobucket CEO Leonard says he is on solid legal ground, citing an update to the company's terms of service in October that grants it the \"unrestricted right\" to sell any uploaded content for the purpose of training AI systems. He sees licensing data as an alternative to selling ads.\n\n\"We need to pay our bills, and this could give us the ability to continue to support free accounts,\" he said.\n\nDefined.ai's Braga said she avoids acquiring content from \"platform\" companies like Photobucket and prefers to source social media photos from influencers who create them, who she said have a clearer claim to licensing rights.\n\n\"I would find it very risky,\" Braga said of platform content. \"If there's some AI that generates something that resembles a picture of someone who never approved that, that's a problem.\"\n\nPhotobucket is not alone among platforms in embracing licensing. Tumblr's parent company Automattic said last month it was sharing content with \"select AI companies\". In February, Reuters reported Reddit struck a deal with Google to make its content available for training the latter's AI models.\n\nAhead of its initial public offering in March, Reddit disclosed that its data-licensing business is the subject of a US Federal Trade Commission inquiry and acknowledged it could fall foul of evolving privacy and intellectual-property regulations.\n\nThe FTC, which warned businesses in February against retroactively changing terms of service for AI usage, declined to comment on the Reddit inquiry or say whether it was looking into other training data deals. - Reuters",

Omdia's report suggests to get ahead, developers should tailor those solutions to meet user needs.\n\nFor business users, Omdia said AI PCs need to be suitable for the \"Corporate Warrior\" persona, a business user who makes heavy use of collaboration tools, is less technically savvy and works both from home and in the office requiring portable hardware.\n\nThe report suggests that the business PC user is the biggest and least well-served by Apple and Nvidia.\n\nIntel with its new Core Ultra CPU is heavily targeting neglected business users, according to Omdia. The report suggests, however, that the \"Corporate Warrior\" user requires a \"just works\" experience, with flashy experiences likely not top of their list of demands for a PC.\n\nRelated:AI PCs Are Going Mainstream Says AMD's Jason Banta\n\n\"User personas are crucial to understanding this space,\" according to the report. \"Many users will have minimal patience for reduced battery life or more weight to heave around. Their needs must be understood holistically, including things such as form factor, interaction design and APIs.\"\n\nSmall Models Prove Enticing\n\nOmdia's report highlights another area that PC developers could target to attract new customers, small language models.\n\nSmall language models are smaller-scale AI systems that can perform generation tasks that large language models do, but using a minuscule amount of memory.\n\nOmdia suggests PC developers tap into the likes of TinyLlama and Microsoft's new Phi-3-mini to entice developers into picking up new PCs.\n\nSmall language models like these could, for example, power agents on an AI PC to execute user requests, the report suggests\n\n\"You can't underestimate the importance of unified memory to AI on the PC,\" said Alexander Harrowell, Omdia's principal analyst for advanced computing.",

        "text": "It's undeniable that artificial intelligence (AI) is changing the technology landscape as we know it. This is evident by the number of AI-related tech companies that are perched among the most valuable companies in the world, as measured by market cap.\n\nMicrosoft sits high atop the list and is the only one to boast a market cap that exceeds $3 trillion. It wrested the crown from Apple, which continues to cling to second place with $2.6 trillion. Nvidia, fueled by its gold-standard AI processors, has gained 200% over the past year to take the third spot, worth just over $2 trillion. Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms -- each with strong ties to AI -- sport market caps of between $1.2 trillion and $1.9 trillion.\n\nWith a market cap of less than $73 billion as of this writing, it might seem like heresy to suggest that CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD) might have a shot at the $1 trillion club. However, the need to defend against AI-fueled cybersecurity attacks will only increase from here. CrowdStrike's ever-improving algorithms and cloud-native platform provide the foundation for the company's success, which suggests it's only a matter of time before it joins this exclusive fraternity.\n\nThe global average cost of a data breach in 2023 was $4.45 million, according to a report by IBM, and that amount grows with each passing year. With the increasing stakes and the vast potential for business disruption, cybersecurity has become one of the most important considerations for any business. That's where CrowdStrike comes in.\n\nThe company's Falcon platform provides the industry's most sophisticated threat protection, leveraging advanced AI and machine learning to stop threats within seconds while also preventing future attacks. The system is trained on more than 2 trillion threat events per day, and its AI-powered system improves with each encounter. CrowdStrike has expanded beyond its endpoint security roots, providing a growing suite of products, including cloud security, identity security, security information and event management, threat intel, data protection, and exposure management services.\n\nThe proof is in the pudding, or so the saying goes. For its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (ended Jan. 31), CrowdStrike's revenue jumped 33% year over year to $637 million, and its diluted earnings per share grew 102%, thanks to its expanding operating margin. At the same time, the company's annual recurring revenue increased 34% to $3.44 billion. Furthermore, customers are adopting a greater number of modules, as those with five, six, or seven modules increased 64%, 43% and 27%, respectively. Deals signed with eight or more modules more than doubled.\n\nManagement expects the company's robust growth to continue, guiding for fiscal 2025 revenue of $3.96 billion at the midpoint of its guidance, representing growth of about 29%. It's worth noting that CrowdStrike has historically provided conservative guidance, so its actual results could conceivably be higher.\n\nThe combination of the growing cybersecurity market and CrowdStrike's increasing suite of security services is pushing the company's market opportunity higher. Management estimates the company's total addressable market (TAM) at $100 billion, growing to $225 billion by 2028.\n\nThe path to $1 trillion\n\nCrowdStrike is one of the most talked-about names in cybersecurity for its expanding suite of security solutions dating back more than a decade.\n\nIn 2023, CrowdStrike was named a leader in Gartner's 2023 Magic Quadrant for endpoint protection -- for the fourth consecutive time -- cited highest for its completeness of vision and ability to execute. CrowdStrike was also named a leader in cloud workload security according to the Forrester Wave Report for Q1 2024, which ranked CrowdStrike highest among all vendors in strategy and received the highest possible scores for vision and innovation. Despite its long and growing list of industry accolades, the company will need to continue to execute, and joining the ranks of trillionaires will take time.\n\nIn fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 31) CrowdStrike generated revenue of $3.06 billion, giving it a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of roughly 24. Assuming its P/S remains constant, CrowdStrike would have to increase its revenue to about $42 billion annually to support a $1 trillion market cap. For context, Wall Street is forecasting revenue of $3.97 billion for fiscal 2025 and $5.03 billion in fiscal 2026, so revenue of that magnitude is still a way off.\n\nIf the company were able to maintain its 33% year-over-year growth rate, CrowdStrike could reach the $1 trillion market cap threshold by 2033. However, maintaining that level of growth for a decade would be a tall order. If we decrease its average revenue growth rate to a more modest 27%, CrowdStrike could potentially reach a $1 trillion market cap by 2035.\n\nThere's reason to believe that the need for strong cybersecurity solutions will continue. The damage from cyberattacks is expected to hit $10.5 trillion by 2025, a 300% increase over the past decade, according to data compiled by McKinsey & Company. The total addressable market for security solutions is expected to surge to between $1.5 trillion and $2 trillion, or roughly 10 times the current market size, over the next 20 years or so.\n\nIf CrowdStrike can capture just a small part of that growing market opportunity, it could soon join the $1 trillion club.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and CrowdStrike wasn't one of them.

        "text": "After years of back and forth rules, the FCC voted to prevent internet providers from meddling in broadband speeds.\n\nThe US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is restoring previous net neutrality rules to regulate the broadband sector, to ensure the internet is \"fast, open and fair\".\n\nThe FCC voted yesterday (25 April) to reclassify broadband services as a \"Title II telecommunications service\", essentially giving itself the authority to act as a watchdog over this sector.\n\nThe US Commission says these net neutrality rules prohibit internet service providers from blocking, throttling or engaging in \"paid prioritisation\" of lawful content. The FCC said net neutrality treats the internet as an \"essential service\" and prevents providers from meddling in the broadband speed of their customers.\n\nThe US has been in a long internal battle around these net neutrality rules. The FCC claims one of its chairs first challenged the broadband industry in 2004 to preserve \"internet freedoms\". Rules around net neutrality were introduced in the US during the presidency of Barack Obama, but were reversed during the presidency of former US president Donald Trump.\n\nThe argument has continued since then however, as California signed net neutrality legislation into state law in 2018, a move that former FCC chair Ajit Pai described as \"illegal\" at the time.\n\n\"Through its actions today, the Commission creates a national standard by which it can ensure that broadband internet service is treated as an essential service,\" the FCC said in a statement yesterday. \"Today's vote also makes clear that the Commission will exercise its authority over broadband in a narrowly tailored fashion - without rate regulation, tariffing, or unbundling - to foster continued innovation and investment.\"\n\nThese net neutrality rules give the FCC the ability to \"revoke the authorisations\" of foreign-owned entities to operate broadband networks in the US, if they \"pose a threat to national security\".\n\nThe new rules also allow the FCC to \"play an active role\" around internet outages and push providers to adequately address these incidents.\n\n\"Without such authority, the FCC cannot require companies to even report broadband outages, cannot collect outage data, and lacks the authority to consider ways that it can help protect against and recover from internet service outages,\" the FCC said in a blogpost about net neutrality.\n\nIt is likely that the discussion around net neutrality is not over, however. Republican commissioners at the FCC spoke against the vote and industry groups are expected to challenge the rules in court, CNN reports.\n\nImage: Stephen Melkisethian via Flickr (CC BY-NC-ND 2.0)\n\nFind out how emerging tech trends are transforming tomorrow with our new podcast, Future Human: The Series.

Transactions instantly settle on-chain and automatically convert to fiat.\"\n\nStripe used to allow bitcoin payments on its platform until 2018, when it stopped the service owning to an increasingly volatile and unstable crypto market. The company briefly made a comeback in the space with a Twitter collaboration in 2022 to test crypto payouts, but this was soon rescinded.\n\nNow, with bitcoin reaching a record high in value last month as investor interest resurges, Stripe wants to slowly, but carefully, dip its toes back in. This comes amid a general push to woo more new customers as the company splits its payments service from other services to make the platform more modular.\n\nAlso announced at Sessions this week, the move means that customers will be able to use some of Stripe's services without needing to be clients of its main payments platform.\n\nStripe described this approach as an \"all-or-nothing\" proposition that cut off a chunk of potential users from onboarding to its platform, such as large enterprises that are unable to breach existing long-term contracts.\n\nIn recent years, speculation has been growing around a potential Stripe IPO. It was valued at $65bn in February and raised $694m in a stock sale earlier this month. The company said it processed more than $1trn in payments last year.\n\nFind out how emerging tech trends are transforming tomorrow with our new podcast, Future Human: The Series.

        "text": "Samsung appears to be stepping up its game in the virtual reality (VR) space, as a new patent filing emerges. The documentation, discovered by MySmartPrice, points to a VR headset that not only rivals Apple's Vision Pro but may also incorporate unique features like infrared sensors for augmented reality (AR) experiences.\n\nThis move hints at Samsung's ambition to expand its presence in the VR AR sectors. The patent, registered at the Korean Intellectual Property Office, is intriguingly titled, \"Communication methods and apparatus utilizing av in virtual space.\"\n\nSamsung's Patent Hints at VR Headset\n\nThe pantent outlines a device capable of creating virtual avatars through collection of environmental data via multiple sensors. Although the word 'headset' is conspicuously absent, the description strongly implies a VR headset, shrouded in secrecy possibly due to confidentiality.\n\nRemarkably, Samsung's prospective VR device is designed to work in harmony with other gadgets, such as wireless headphones and smartwatches. It is poised to offer users the ability to share health and exercise data, including heart rate and calories burned, in real time through a virtual avatar.\n\nThis level of integration suggests a more immersive and interactive VR experience than is currently available. The document details an array of sensors-accelerometer, gyroscope, camera, and infrared-that will enable the headset to provide real-time tracking of user movements and positions.\n\nCompared to Apple's Vision Pro\n\nWhile Apple's Vision Pro has set a high bar in the VR world with its sophisticated sensor array creating immersive virtual environments, Samsung's patent suggests a leap forward. The inclusion of external device integration could offer users a more holistic and feature-rich experience.\n\nHowever, Samsung has not made any official announcements regarding the development of this VR headset, leaving tech enthusiasts eagerly awaiting further details. The patent also hints at advanced features like an integrated navigation system, along with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity.\n\nIt suggests the device will be powered by its processor, graphics processing unit (GPU), and neural processing unit (NPU), supported by a rechargeable battery. The precise battery placement within the device remains unspecified.\n\nAs the tech world watches closely, Samsung's foray into the next generation of VR technology could spark a new rivalry with Apple. Although the details are currently limited to patent filings, the potential for Samsung to introduce a groundbreaking VR headset is palpable.",

This latest beta follows the second beta release for public beta testers, which was made available by Apple a week ago, following the initial developer beta launch.\n\nTo access the iOS 17.5 and iPadOS 17.5 betas, public beta testers can navigate to the Settings app on their devices, select the Software Update section, tap on \"Beta Updates,\" and toggle on the iOS 17 or iPadOS 17 Public Beta option.It's important to sign up on Apple's beta testing website to gain access to these beta versions.\n\nThe primary focus of iOS 17.5 is on changes within the European Union, with limited new outward-facing features. Notably, app developers in the EU now have the capability to offer their iPhone apps for direct download from their websites, bypassing the need to utilise the App Store.\n\nHowever, this feature comes with specific criteria, including membership in the Apple Developer Program for at least two continuous years and having an app with over one million first installs on iOS in the EU in the prior year. Furthermore, developers must adhere to Apple's notarization process and publish transparent data collection policies.\n\nIt's important to note that this feature is exclusive to the European Union due to the Digital Markets Act and is not available to all users.\n\nIn addition to the EU-focused changes, iOS 17.5 and iPadOS 17.5 include updates to mobile device management, and there are indications of forthcoming Battery Health functionality for new iPads, along with alerts for third-party item trackers, based on code changes observed in the software.\n\nThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

        "text": "It's undeniable that artificial intelligence (AI) is changing the technology landscape as we know it. This is evident by the number of AI-related tech companies that are perched among the most valuable companies in the world, as measured by market cap.\n\nMicrosoft sits high atop the list and is the only one to boast a market cap that exceeds $3 trillion. It wrested the crown from Apple, which continues to cling to second place with $2.6 trillion. Nvidia, fueled by its gold-standard AI processors, has gained 200% over the past year to take the third spot, worth just over $2 trillion. Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms -- each with strong ties to AI -- sport market caps of between $1.2 trillion and $1.9 trillion.\n\nWith a market cap of less than $73 billion as of this writing, it might seem like heresy to suggest that CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD) might have a shot at the $1 trillion club. However, the need to defend against AI-fueled cybersecurity attacks will only increase from here. CrowdStrike's ever-improving algorithms and cloud-native platform provide the foundation for the company's success, which suggests it's only a matter of time before it joins this exclusive fraternity.\n\nThe global average cost of a data breach in 2023 was $4.45 million, according to a report by IBM, and that amount grows with each passing year. With the increasing stakes and the vast potential for business disruption, cybersecurity has become one of the most important considerations for any business. That's where CrowdStrike comes in.\n\nThe company's Falcon platform provides the industry's most sophisticated threat protection, leveraging advanced AI and machine learning to stop threats within seconds while also preventing future attacks. The system is trained on more than 2 trillion threat events per day, and its AI-powered system improves with each encounter. CrowdStrike has expanded beyond its endpoint security roots, providing a growing suite of products, including cloud security, identity security, security information and event management, threat intel, data protection, and exposure management services.\n\nThe proof is in the pudding, or so the saying goes. For its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (ended Jan. 31), CrowdStrike's revenue jumped 33% year over year to $637 million, and its diluted earnings per share grew 102%, thanks to its expanding operating margin. At the same time, the company's annual recurring revenue increased 34% to $3.44 billion. Furthermore, customers are adopting a greater number of modules, as those with five, six, or seven modules increased 64%, 43% and 27%, respectively. Deals signed with eight or more modules more than doubled.\n\nManagement expects the company's robust growth to continue, guiding for fiscal 2025 revenue of $3.96 billion at the midpoint of its guidance, representing growth of about 29%. It's worth noting that CrowdStrike has historically provided conservative guidance, so its actual results could conceivably be higher.\n\nThe combination of the growing cybersecurity market and CrowdStrike's increasing suite of security services is pushing the company's market opportunity higher. Management estimates the company's total addressable market (TAM) at $100 billion, growing to $225 billion by 2028.\n\nCrowdStrike is one of the most talked-about names in cybersecurity for its expanding suite of security solutions dating back more than a decade.\n\nIn 2023, CrowdStrike was named a leader in Gartner's 2023 Magic Quadrant for endpoint protection -- for the fourth consecutive time -- cited highest for its completeness of vision and ability to execute. CrowdStrike was also named a leader in cloud workload security according to the Forrester Wave Report for Q1 2024, which ranked CrowdStrike highest among all vendors in strategy and received the highest possible scores for vision and innovation. Despite its long and growing list of industry accolades, the company will need to continue to execute, and joining the ranks of trillionaires will take time.\n\nIn fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 31) CrowdStrike generated revenue of $3.06 billion, giving it a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of roughly 24. Assuming its P/S remains constant, CrowdStrike would have to increase its revenue to about $42 billion annually to support a $1 trillion market cap. For context, Wall Street is forecasting revenue of $3.97 billion for fiscal 2025 and $5.03 billion in fiscal 2026, so revenue of that magnitude is still a way off.\n\nIf the company were able to maintain its 33% year-over-year growth rate, CrowdStrike could reach the $1 trillion market cap threshold by 2033. However, maintaining that level of growth for a decade would be a tall order. If we decrease its average revenue growth rate to a more modest 27%, CrowdStrike could potentially reach a $1 trillion market cap by 2035.\n\nThere's reason to believe that the need for strong cybersecurity solutions will continue. The damage from cyberattacks is expected to hit $10.5 trillion by 2025, a 300% increase over the past decade, according to data compiled by McKinsey & Company. The total addressable market for security solutions is expected to surge to between $1.5 trillion and $2 trillion, or roughly 10 times the current market size, over the next 20 years or so.\n\nIf CrowdStrike can capture just a small part of that growing market opportunity, it could soon join the $1 trillion club.\n\nBefore you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and CrowdStrike wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you'd have $488,186!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "text": "Ever since Apple announced EU-exclusive features like third-party app stores, app downloads directly from the browser, and the option to uninstall Safari, I've been jealous. Well, it seems I'm not the only one who is desperate to get my hands on such features. There's another enthusiast who is and he HAS managed to trick his iPhone into believing that he's living in Italy while actually living in Australia.\n\nAdam Demasi from kirkblog has successfully got a taste of EU-exclusive features on his iPhone but the process to get those features is convoluted and not feasible for many to try. With iOS 17.4, Apple rolled out a new system dubbed eligibility, which along with country (another system) determines the location of the user. Additionally, there are multiple other parameters that are analyzed internally to get the location before Apple allows users to access geo-restricted features.\n\nTo grant access to features, Apple downloads a file named plist that consists of individual features locked behind a geo-restriction. Demasi explains, \"At the time of writing, there are 24 (although one is missing), and the file was last updated on the 5th of April. We weren't tracking updates to it before this week, so I don't know what changed exactly.\"\n\nAfter figuring it out, Demasi took an old iPhone 12 Pro Max, reset the phone, disabled the location services and tried an Italian SIM card, and registered with an Italian Apple ID. However, this didn't bore any fruit.\n\nThen, he set up a WiFi router broadcasting as if it is working in a European country. He had to disable the 5GHz channel due to the differences in the regulations in Australia and Europe. However, the device's logs and countryd config file still showed his location as Australia. Demasi even tried erasing everything and resetting the iPhone again but no luck!\n\nNext, he went to his basement where there was no cellular reception, and reset the iPhone again. This time when he opened Safari, he was prompted to choose a browser. Then, he put the iPhone in the AirPlane mode to avoid catching mobile signals and went upstairs.\n\nAnd he was successful in tricking the iPhone into believing that he was in Italy. Thus, he was able to access all EU-exclusive features.\n\nHowever, the workaround and all the tinkering he did to get the features were nothing short of tedious. To keep using the EU features, his iPhone needs to be in Airplane mode and connected to the same Wi-Fi network which has been configured as per Europe.\n\nIs the setup good enough to test out the features? Yes. Would you like to go through so much hassle for it? Probably not. But yes, there's a way you can try the features.",

The university said it will still host dozens of commencement events, including all the traditional individual school commencement ceremonies, during which students cross a stage and receive their diplomas.\n\nTensions were already high after the university canceled a planned commencement speech by the school's pro-Palestinian valedictorian, citing safety concerns.\n\n\"We understand that this is disappointing; however, we are adding many new activities and celebrations to make this commencement academically meaningful, memorable, and uniquely USC,\" the university said in a statement Thursday. Those include gatherings, the releasing of doves and performances by the marching band.\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department said 93 people were arrested Wednesday night during a campus protest for allegedly trespassing. One person was arrested on allegations of assault with a deadly weapon.\n\nAt Emerson College in Boston, 108 people were arrested overnight at an alleyway encampment. And new encampments and protests continued to pop up at campuses across the country.\n\nStudents protesting the war are demanding schools cut financial ties to Israel and divest from companies enabling the conflict. Some Jewish students say the protests have veered into antisemitism and made them afraid to set foot on campus.\n\nAt Emerson, video shows police first warning students in the alleyway to leave. Students link arms to resist officers, who move forcefully through the crowd and throw some protesters to the ground.\n\n\"As the night progressed, it got tenser and tenser. There were just more cops on all sides. It felt like we were being slowly pushed in and crushed,\" said Ocean Muir, a sophomore.\n\n\"For me, the scariest moment was holding these umbrellas out in case we were tear-gassed, and hearing them come, and hearing their boots on the ground, just pounding into the ground louder than we could chant, and not being able to see a single person,\" she said.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nMuir said police lifted her by her arms and legs and carried her away. Along with other students, Muir was charged Thursday with trespassing and disorderly conduct.\n\nEmerson College leaders had earlier warned students that the alley has a public right-of-way and city authorities had threatened to take action if the protesters didn't leave. Emerson canceled classes Thursday, and Boston police said four officers suffered injuries that were not life-threatening during the confrontation.\n\nThe University of Texas at Austin campus was much calmer Thursday after 55 people were arrested a day earlier -- 26 of whom had no affiliation with the university, according to a statement to the campus by university president Jay Hartzell. University officials pulled back barricades and allowed demonstrators onto the main square beneath the school's iconic clock tower.\n\nThursday's gathering of students and some faculty protested both the war and Wednesday's arrests, when state troopers in riot gear and on horseback bulldozed into protesters, forcing hundreds of students off the school's main lawn.\n\nAt Emory University in Atlanta, local and state police swept in to dismantle a camp, although the university said the protesters weren't students but rather outside activists. Some officers carried semiautomatic weapons, and video shows officers using a stun gun on one protester who they had pinned to the ground.\n\nProtesters at Emory chanted slogans supporting Palestinians and opposing a public safety training center being built in Atlanta. The two movements are closely entwined in Atlanta, where there has been years of \"Stop Cop City\" activism that has included attacks on property.\n\nJail records showed 22 people arrested by Emory police were charged with disorderly conduct.\n\nBut many colleges, including Harvard University, were choosing not to take immediate action against protesters who had set up tents, even though they were openly defying campus rules. And some colleges were making new rules, like Northwestern University, which hastily changed its student code of conduct Thursday morning to bar tents on its suburban Chicago campus.\n\nGeorge Washington University said it would move its law school finals from a building next to the protest encampment to a new location, because of the noise.\n\nThe current wave of protests was inspired by events at Columbia University in New York, where police cleared an encampment and arrested more than 100 people last week, only for students to defiantly put up tents again, in an area where many are set to graduate in front of families in a few weeks. Columbia has said it plans to continue negotiations with protesters through early Friday.\n\nU.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona said the ability to embrace student voices and different perspectives was a hallmark of the nation's growth but warned authorities wouldn't tolerate hate, discrimination or threats of violence.\n\n\"We continue to follow reports about protests -- including very alarming reports of antisemitism -- on and around college campuses across the country,\" he said in a statement.\n\nNational A look at the Gaza war protests that have emerged on US college campuses By The Associated Press\n\nSince the Israel-Hamas war began, the U.S. Education Department has launched civil rights investigations into dozens of universities and schools in response to complaints of antisemitism or Islamophobia. Among those under investigation are many colleges facing protests, including Harvard and Columbia.\n\nGaza war protests ignite on US college campuses 0 Comments Tags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.",

This will lead to clouds, and in some places some drizzle, but the air above 5,000 feet will be especially dry, keeping any significant rain away.\n\nWarmer air building across the Midwest will begin to advance toward Virginia on Saturday. The leading edge of the warmer air -- a warm front -- will spread more clouds into the state, but the true warmer air will be about a day away. The end result will be a Saturday with lots of clouds, but with a stubborn area of high pressure nosing southward down the east side of the Appalachians, only a few showers are expected on Saturday morning.\n\nThe warmer air spills into Virginia on Sunday and stays through at least Wednesday next week with afternoon temperatures consistently 80 degrees or higher.\n\nA couple of weak disturbances will push across the state late Tuesday and again Thursday, and the second of those has a better chance to produce thunderstorms with a couple of hours worth of rain. Once that window for rain closes, a dry, but cooler period follows for Friday and Saturday, with afternoons in the upper 60s or 70s.\n\nBut the total amount of rain ahead for the state is small. Many locations may not have any rain at all over the next seven days.\n\nMost of the state has been drier than normal in April, so we do need to be mindful of a legitimate drought developing during the next couple of weeks. Central North Carolina is already drier than Virginia, and we should expect that dry area to expand northward into Virginia in the next week or two.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nAlthough the most intense heat of summer is still a couple of months away, it is important to remember that a dry ground leads to higher temperatures during the summer. The reason for this is relatively intuitive.\n\nAll else being equal, when the ground is moist, the daytime energy from the sun goes into warming and drying the soils. Therefore, when the ground is dry, all of that energy goes into raising the temperatures of the ground rather than evaporating the moisture.\n\nVegetated land -- from grass to trees -- also helps keep the ground cooler, as green plants are absorbing solar energy during photosynthesis. This is another one of the reasons that arid climates west of the Mississippi River can more easily get above 100 degrees in the summer compared to Virginia.\n\nAlso concerning, there is additional evidence to suggest this summer will be hotter than average. On top of the background warming climate, the Pacific Ocean near the equator is likely headed into a La Niña pattern, meaning the water there is cooler than normal. That transition often correlates to hotter than average summers in Virginia, although the correlation is not a dominant one.\n\nThe warming climate signal becomes more obvious when recent summer temperatures in Virginia are examined, as most summers have been hotter than average in the last 20 years.\n\nIn Roanoke, the average summer temperature over the last 100 years is 74.9 degrees. It has been a decade since we had a summer below that average, holding at 74.6 degrees in 2014. More recently, three of the last four summers -- 2020, '21, and '22 -- were among the ten hottest summers on record. Last year was still hotter than average, just not as much at 75.8 degrees.\n\nMost of this rise has come in the jump in overnight low temperatures versus an increase in explicitly hot days. Summer humidity climbs as the climate warms, keeping the air from cooling as much at night. There is also a secondary impact from the urban heat island effect, but the rise in overnight low temperatures is seen in rural, suburban, and urban settings, so it is not the primary cause.\n\nEither way, enjoy the cooler break Friday and Saturday while we have it. A long, hot Virginia summer is right around the corner.\n\nTags Roanoke Virginia Weather Weekend Cool Warm Showers Vawx Meteorology Physics Ethics Construction Industry Sports Local Weather\n\nGet the daily forecast and severe weather alerts in your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.

        "text": "US equity ETFs have proved more reliable than active managers since 2014.\n\nInvestors who like steady strategies with predictable results should stick to exchange-traded funds (ETFs) when investing in US equities, data from FE Analytics shows.\n\nTwo trackers in particular - the iShares VII plc Core S&P 500 UCITS ETF and the Vanguard S&P 500 UCITS ETF - have outperformed the S&P 500 every year since 2014, something no other fund in the IA North America sector achieved\n\nBeing passive in nature, these ETFs are designed to replicate the S&P 500 so their tracking error is very small. However, their returns have been slightly better than the index every year and their fees are much lower than actively-managed funds.\n\nThis has been a decade in which the highly-concentrated S&P 500 - the most common benchmark in the IA North America sector - shot the lights out, making it a difficult hurdle for active managers to match. Large-caps have outperformed small- and mid-caps in recent years too, especially in 2023 when the 'Magnificent Seven' dominated - a factor that has gone against active mangers who tend to hunt for undiscovered opportunities lower down the cap spectrum.\n\nLaunched in 2010, the iShares portfolio is the bigger of the two passive giants, with £66bn of assets under management (AUM) compared to Vanguard's £40bn.\n\nThe latter was recommended by FE Investments analysts for offering \"great benefits\" to end investors, including an ongoing charge of just 0.07%, made possible through Vanguard's corporate structure and economies of scale, which facilitate heavy cost-cutting.\n\nBoth funds have a FE fundinfo passive Crown Rating of five - the highest score.\n\nSource: Trustnet. The red highlights indicate underperformance against the specified benchmark.\n\nAlthough the table above is full of passive strategies, AB American Growth Portfolio and Alger American Asset Growth are the exceptions and have outperformed in seven of the past 10 years.\n\nThe £5.7bn AB American Growth Portfolio is co-managed by Frank Caruso, John H. Fogarty and Vinay Thapar, who invest in 55 US large-cap companies and charge 0.94%.\n\nThe top 10 holdings make up 50% of the fund and include five of the Maginficent Seven stocks, leaving out Apple and Tesla. In the past 10 years, its performance has moved in tandem with the S&P 500 index 91% of the time.\n\nAlger American Asset Growth is a much smaller vehicle (£307m) under the responsibility of Patrick Kelly, Ankur Crawford and Dan C. Chung.\n\nBased in New York, the team focuses on companies with rapidly growing demand, strong business models and market dominance, or where the managers can find catalysts that could drive additional growth, such as new management, product innovation or M&A activity.\n\nThe fund charges a 1% management fee and was 90% correlated to the S&P 500 during the past 10 years.\n\nActive managers achieved more success in the IA North American Smaller Companies sector, where CT American Smaller Companies and T. Rowe Price US Smaller Companies Equity beat the Russell 2000 index for eight of the past 10 years.\n\nRun by veteran manager Nicolas Janvier, the £946m Columbia Threadneedle Investments (CTI) fund was recommended by FE Investment analysts for the lead manager's experience, CTI's extensive analytical resources in New York and Boston, and the focus on bottom-up stock picking.\n\nLimits are placed on the fund's sector and factor bets, which \"allows for more consistent performance relative to the small and mid-cap market, regardless of the stylistic and macroeconomic environment\", FE analysts explained.\n\nSince 2021, the strategy has decoupled from its benchmark, the Russell 2500, and its average peer, keeping well ahead since then. It achieved a 249% return over the past 10 years against a sector average of 184.4%.\n\nIts largest exposures are to industrials (19.9%), consumer products (17.9%) and telecom, media and technology (16.3%).\n\nSource: Trustnet. The red highlights indicate underperformance against the specified benchmark.\n\nThe strategy shares the podium with the much larger £2.8bn T. Rowe Price US Smaller Companies Equity fund managed by Curt Organt and Matt Mahon.\n\nWhile they prefer a slightly different sector allocation, favouring services (20.5%), media and tech (17.5%) and basic materials (15.3%), the two funds are 93% correlated to each other.\n\nAnother difference is T. Rowe Price's small off-benchmark bet on European equities (1.4%), absent in the CT American Smaller Companies fund.",

        "text": "New Delhi: As geopolitical tensions mount, Apple is performing a delicate balancing act, deepening its connections with China while also expanding its manufacturing base into Southeast Asia and India. This strategy highlights the complex dynamics of global tech supply chains in today's political and economic environment.\n\nAccording to a recent Nikkei Asia report, Apple is increasingly leaning on Chinese suppliers despite the broader industry trend towards diversification. The report notes that while Apple has reduced its number of suppliers from Taiwan, the U.S., Japan, and South Korea, it has increased its reliance on Chinese companies.\n\nDespite the expansion in Southeast Asia and India, the proportion of Chinese and Hong Kong suppliers operating in Vietnam remains high at 37%. This indicates that while the geographic diversity of Apple's supply chain is increasing, its economic ties with China are still significant.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook's recent activities underscore the company's strategy to balance its operations across Asia. Cook's tour included visits to China, Vietnam, and other Southeast Asian countries, emphasizing the importance of each region in Apple's supply chain. During his visits, Cook met with high-ranking officials and business leaders, reflecting Apple's diplomatic approach to managing its vast supply network.\n\nIn China, Cook's engagement with suppliers and government officials highlighted the critical role the country continues to play in Apple's strategy. \"There's no supply chain in the world that's more critical to us than China,\" Cook stated, acknowledging the deep-rooted connections that Apple has developed over the years.\n\nApple's strategy is also shaped by competitive pressures, notably from Chinese tech giant Huawei, which has seen a resurgence in its home market. Huawei's success puts additional pressure on Apple, not just in China but globally, as both companies vie for dominance in the premium handset segment.\n\nThe local manufacturing and investment landscape is also evolving. While Vietnam and Thailand are becoming increasingly popular for tech manufacturing, challenges such as labor shortages and infrastructure constraints are becoming apparent. India remains a key potential market, but complexities in setting up a complete manufacturing ecosystem are causing delays.\n\nAs Apple continues to adapt to the shifting geopolitical and economic landscapes, its supply chain strategies will likely keep evolving. The company's ability to maintain a balance between operational efficiency, geopolitical considerations, and market demands will be crucial for its continued success in the global market.",

        "text": "The government of the Democratic Republic of Congo is accusing Apple of using \"illegally exploited\" minerals extracted from the country's embattled east in its products, lawyers representing the African country said Thursday.\n\nThe DRC's lawyers have sent Apple a formal notice seen by AFP, effectively warning the tech giant that it could face legal action if the alleged practice continues.\n\nThe Paris-based lawyers accused Apple of purchasing minerals smuggled from the DRC into neighboring Rwanda, where they are laundered and \"integrated into the global supply chain.\"\n\nContacted by AFP, Apple pointed to statements from its 2023 annual corporate report regarding the alleged use of so-called conflict minerals that are crucial for a wide range of high-tech products.\n\n\"Based on our due diligence efforts... we found no reasonable basis for concluding that any of the smelters or refiners of 3TG (tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold) determined to be in our supply chain as of December 31, 2023, directly or indirectly financed or benefited armed groups in the DRC or an adjoining country,\" it said.\n\nThe DRC's mineral-rich Great Lakes region has been wracked by violence since regional wars in the 1990s, with tensions resurging in late 2021 when rebels from the March 23 Movement (M23) began recapturing swathes of territory.\n\nThe DRC, the United Nations, and Western countries accuse Rwanda of supporting rebel groups, including M23, in a bid to control the region's vast mineral resources, an allegation Kigali denies.\n\n\"Apple has sold technology made with minerals sourced from a region whose population is being devastated by grave human rights violations,\" the DRC's lawyers wrote.\n\nSexual violence, armed attacks, and widespread corruption at sites providing minerals to Apple are just some of the claims leveled in the letter.\n\nMacs, iPhones and other Apple products are \"tainted by the blood of the Congolese people,\" the DRC's lawyers said.\n\nFrench lawyers William Bourdon and Vincent Brengarth sent the formal notice this week to two Apple subsidiaries in France, and lawyer Robert Amsterdam sent them to the tech company's US headquarters.\n\n\"Apple has consistently relied on a range of suppliers that buy minerals from Rwanda, a mineral-poor country that has preyed upon the DRC and plundered its natural resources for nearly three decades,\" they wrote.\n\nThe DRC is rich in tantalum, tin, tungsten, and gold -- often referred to as 3T or 3TG -- that are used in producing smartphones and other electronic devices.\n\nThe tech giant's efforts to ethically source its minerals are \"notoriously insufficient,\" Bourdon and Amsterdam wrote.\n\n\"Apple seems to rely mainly on the vigilance of its suppliers and their commitment to respect Apple's code of conduct,\" reads the official letter.\n\nBut both their suppliers and external audits appear to rely on certification from the Tin Supply Chain Initiative (ITSCI), \"which has been shown to have numerous and serious shortcomings,\" the formal notice said.\n\nThe ITSCI program is one of the main mechanisms set up over ten years ago to ensure the supply of \"conflict-free\" minerals in the DRC, according to the British NGO Global Witness.\n\nIn April 2022, Global Witness accused ITSCI of contributing to the laundering of conflict minerals, child labor, trafficking, and smuggling in the DRC.\n\nApple is not the only major company relying on the \"flawed\" system, Global Witness said.\n\nTesla, Intel, and Samsung are among the companies that depend on ITSCI, but Global Witness's report revealed that \"90 percent of the minerals\" from specific mining sites reviewed by the program did not come from validated mines.\n\nThe DRC's formal notice to Apple includes questions about \"3T minerals used in Apple products\" and demands that the tech company respond \"within three weeks.\"\n\n\"All legal options are on the table,\" the lawyers told AFP.\n\nGrowing demand for cobalt and copper to power so-called clean energy, including rechargeable batteries, has also led to forced evictions, sexual assault, arson, and beatings in eastern DRC, according to a 2023 Amnesty International Report.\n\nM23 rebels currently control large swathes of North Kivu and are encircling the provincial capital of Goma, where more than one million displaced by the war have crammed into desperate camps.\n\nThe UN said in 2023 that people living in eastern DRC faced unheard-of violence, naming it one of the \"worst places\" in the world for children.\n\nMinerals are transported into Rwanda, where they are laundered to outmaneuver oversight meant to prevent the sale of \"conflict minerals,\" according to Global Witness.\n\n\"The responsibility of Apple and other major tech manufacturers when they use blood minerals has for too long remained a black box,\" the lawyers told AFP.",

That's a newer version of the Kirin 9000s made by Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. for the Mate 60 Pro, which alarmed officials in Washington who thought a 7-nanometer chip beyond China's capabilities.\n\nHuawei has enjoyed a resurgence since the Mate's August debut, riding a wave of celebration around its ability to realize sophisticated semiconductor manufacturing despite escalating US technology export curbs. Its Pura 70 series sold out within two days of their launch, according to market checks conducted by Jefferies analysts led by Edison Lee. US officials are now weighing additional sanctions intended to ring-fence the company and China's semiconductor ambitions more broadly.\n\nRead More: US Weighs Sanctioning Huawei's Secretive Chinese Chip Network\n\nTechInsights, which was the first to identify the original 9000s in conjunction with Bloomberg News, said it found \"with high confidence\" that the Pura contained a Huawei Kirin 9010 fabricated using SMIC's so-called 7nm N+2 process, an enhanced version of typical 7nm manufacturing.\n\nFormerly known as the P series, the Pura line has traditionally sold on the strength of their camera capabilities. Giving domestic users a fresh option could apply further pressure on the iPhone, which isn't due for an upgrade until September. Huawei is likely to see further market share gains ahead of the June 18 sales festival, Jefferies said.\n\nFor Huawei, it's another step toward rebuilding a consumer business devastated by Trump-era sanctions.

        "text": "Tired of the so-called AI PCs already? Buckle up because we, or perhaps the artificial intelligence, haven't even begun to peak. More power-efficient ARM-based CPUs don't get nearly as much limelight as the x86 type. Still, chipmaker Qualcomm is trying to turn your eyes toward its latest Snapdragon chips by promising the best AI performance out there on a consumer-end chip.\n\nSure, we've known about the Snapdragon X Elite for months, but now the chipmaker has a new PC CPU that's the slightest bit more wallet-friendly, the Snapdragon X Plus, which will likely be powering a whole slew of PCs in the coming months. Maybe, just maybe, some app developers and Windows itself will finally deliver on the promise of on-device AI.\n\nThe Snapdragon X Elite is already boasting it will outmatch Intel's x86 chips' performance, requiring much less power. The Snapdragon X Plus is in the same vein, but it will be slightly slower than its bigger brother. Specifically, Qualcomm's Geekbench 6 benchmarks show the X Plus is 37% faster and 54% more efficient than an Intel Core Ultra 7 155H that's become so common in most of the mobile PCs released this year. Cinebench 2024 tests also showed it was a fair deal faster than Intel's baseline Meteor Lake chip and the AMD Ryzen 9 7940HS.\n\nGizmodo had the opportunity to test some of these benchmarks on Qualcomm-made test machines. Though those benchmarks seemed to be accurate, we'd much prefer to have consumer-grade machines in hand to test them and compare. It can also be compared to Apple's M3 chip, perhaps with a little less gusto. The M3 chip may still win out, especially in multi-core performance, but again, it's something we'd much prefer to test in-house. Otherwise, the X Plus promises to support one internal laptop screen at 4K and 120 Hz or up to three external monitors at 4K and 60 Hz. It will also be WiFi 7 compatible and enable capture with up to a 4K HDR webcam.\n\nWhat's much harder to quantify is the AI performance. Qualcomm is hedging its bets on the quality of its NPU, which is the same as that of the X Elite and the X Plus. The chipmaker is claiming its NPU maxes at 45 TOPS, that being \"trillions of operations per second.\" Sure, that might mean Stable Diffusion running on-device can pump out a few deep fakes faster than the competition, but as always, these\n\nThere will be four SKUs in total for the Snapdragon X brand in 2024. The Elite X1E-84-100 is the tippy top with 12 cores, a max multithread frequency of 3.8 GHz, and a dual-core boost of 4.2 GHz. Without boring you, the two other versions of the elite top out at slightly lower speeds, and they don't have the full GPU performance as the top end. We saw some Qualcomm machines running emulations of games like Baldur's Gate III with an X Elite chip on framerates that hovered above 30, though on medium-to-low graphics settings. It's a contention whether Qualcomm claims that the X Elite's Adreno GPU should be gaming-capable when many games still don't support the ARM architecture. Apple has been dealing with this problem for ages, and even after a big push with gaming in its M3 chip, the lack of playable titles still persists. I can't imagine trying high-profile games on just the X Elite without a discrete GPU.\n\nMeanwhile, the X Plus has only one SKU and sits at ten cores with 3.4 GHz of speed and no dual-core boost. It has 3.8 TFLOPs of GPU performance, but it also has an equivalent NPU as the X Elite. The more expensive chip will likely still outperform on AI compared to the X Plus because of its better GPU performance, but that all depends on how app makers try to use the AI architecture, or if any will at all.\n\nWhat Does this Mean for AI Running on PC?\n\nThe X Plus and X Elite will be powering PCs in the future, though we still have yet to see anything other than rumors on which ones will be making their way into consumers' hands sometime this summer. We can likely expect rereleases of existing work-grade laptops, though we don't know what kind of price difference there will be between an X Plus and a Core Ultra 155H or an X Elite versus the Intel Core Ultra 9 185H.\n\nCompanies like Microsoft and Intel have inundated us with incredible AI promises for the last six months, and low and behold, it hasn't fully shaken out like they said they would. We've tested a whole slew of laptops (the Meteor Lake chips have yet to have a desktop version), and while they've performed and benchmarked well, maybe even a cut above other mobile processors at their price point, they haven't truly delivered on on-device AI. The NPU that's supposed to handle routine intelligent tasks never seems to spin up, whether using background blur in Zoom or trying to use the dedicated Windows Copilot in Windows 11.\n\nIn conversations with Intel, we've been told repeatedly that the current generation of chips can power AI on-device. The top brass has told Gizmodo the problem isn't so much on the chipmakers' side but on the app developers. For once, it's not the hardware folks trying to keep up with software demands but the other way around.\n\nHowever, that precludes whether app developers are finding much use in hardware that will support AI and the massive cloud data centers from behemoths like Nvidia, OpenAI, and Microsoft. Microsoft's Build conference is set for May 21, and there, we may finally get a glimpse of the next generation of Copilot, which will hopefully nix some of the obvious, growing problems we continue to have with Windows 11.\n\nChief among them, Copilot could turn into an actual AI assistant capable of turning settings on or off, adjusting your computer based on the context it's running on, and generally be more than a glorified chatbot you can already find in Bing search. That's based on early demos we've seen at some OEM's PC showcases from last year, so we'll have to wait and see what Microsoft has in store.",

        "text": "Snapdragon X Elite -- Qualcomm's flagship computer chip that is expected to arrive on laptop from popular brands this year, has been spotted in a benchmark test. A listing for the purported Surface Laptop 6 on Geekbench suggests that Microsoft's upcoming Surface laptop could beat Apple's MacBook Pro models that are powered by its latest M3 chip, in one CPU test. According to recent reports, Microsoft could launch Surface laptops equipped with Snapdragon X Elite chips at a hardware event in May.\n\nThe Surface Laptop 6 was spotted by WCCFTech on Geekbench, without an official product name. It is listed with the title \"OEMBR OEMBR Product Name MFG\" and the details show that it is powered by a Snapdragon 8cx Gen 3 chipset at 4.01GHz, with 12 cores. It's worth noting that there are three Snapdragon X Elite variants, and the one that was benchmarked was not the most powerful chip -- that variant (XIE-84-100) boasts a 4.20GHz boost clock speed.\n\nThe purported Surface Laptop 6 with a Snapdragon X Elite chip has a single-core score of 2,714 points, and a multi-core score of 14,078 points. This puts the chip ahead of Apple's 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro in Geekbench's multi-core tests -- the M3 MacBook Pro scored 3,103 and 12,065 points, respectively.\n\nIf these benchmark tests are genuine, then Apple's M3 chip should be 13.37 percent faster than the Snapdragon X Elite on the rumoured Surface Laptop 6. Meanwhile, Qualcomm's chip is shown to be 15.4 percent faster than the M3 MacBook Pro. After all, the Snapdragon processor has more cores (12) than Apple's M3 chip (8).\n\nIt's worth taking these benchmarks with a grain of salt, as Microsoft is yet to announce any plans to launch new Surface models with Snapdragon laptop chips. According to a recent report, Microsoft is said to be confident that the Surface Pro 10 and Surface Laptop 6 can beat the latest 3nm Apple Silicon processor. We can expect to learn more about these rumoured devices soon -- Microsoft is tipped to introduce new Surface laptops powered by Snapdragon chips at its next hardware event in next month.",

        "text": "Despite the buzz generated by its high-profile launch, reports suggest that Apple is struggling to sell Vision Pro.\n\nNoted Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo wrote on Medium that Apple has cut its shipment forecast for its expensive mixed reality (MR) headset.\n\nAccording to Kuo, who works for Hong Kong-based TF International Securities, Apple expects to ship 400,000-450,000 units this year, down considerably from its previous forecast of 700,000-800,000 or more.\n\nDescribed by Cult of Mac as the most reliable voice on all things Apple, Kuo said the iPhone maker has opted to cut production of Vision Pro ahead of its international launch. This suggests Apple has plenty of inventory, which implies that demand in the US has \"fallen sharply beyond expectations.\"\n\nTherefore, Apple has also taken a conservative view of demand outside its home country, he said.\n\nKuo also claims that Apple is reviewing and adjusting its head-mounted display (HMD) strategy, and might not release an updated model in 2025, despite a previous expectation that one would be unveiled during the second half.\n\nWeight has been lent to Kuo's assertions by Bloomberg chief correspondent and reliable source of Apple news, Mark Gurman.\n\nIn a newsletter date 21 April, he wrote that according to his sources, requests for Vision Pro demos at Apple stores \"is way down,\" and that \"people who do book appointments often don't show up, and sales - at least at some locations - have gone from a couple of units a day to just a handful in a whole week.\"\n\nGurman owns a Vision Pro headset himself, but confesses that his usage of it has gone from every day to once or twice per week. He says it is too cumbersome to use on a daily basis, and it lacks a killer app that would compel him to make greater use of it.\n\nOfficially launched last June, Vision Pro grabbed attention for its unusual approach to enabling an MR experience - rather than put a head-up display on some clear glasses, it uses an array of cameras to feed the wearer a real-time view of the surrounding environment.\n\nIt also grabbed attention for its hefty price tag of $3,499. That same amount of money can buy a 16-inch MacBook Pro powered by Apple's most advanced silicon to date, the M3 Max. As devices go, a laptop is a lot more versatile, and the owner looks no more or less silly with one strapped to their head (opinions may vary).\n\nApple has a celebrated reputation for arriving fashionably late to new device categories and launching products that inject a profound sense of coolness and desirability into the segment. And despite the cost, there were high hopes that Vision Pro would do the same for the struggling augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR) market.\n\nIn late March, Counterpoint Research revealed that shipments of extended reality (XR) headset slumped 19 percent year-on-year in 2023, driven by the lack of new devices and compelling use cases beyond gaming.\n\nHowever, Counterpoint predicted at the time that Vision Pro would stimulate XR content production and entice other OEMs to get in on the act.\n\nIDC separately predicted that XR shipments would grow 44.2% this year to 9.7 million units, fuelled in part by Vision Pro and the halo effect Apple has.\n\nBut with weak demand forcing Apple to scale back its ambitions - including allegedly putting a follow-up device on the back burner - this could quite easily stunt growth in the AR/VR hardware market.",

This breakthrough will unlock new levels of performance and innovation for Apple's future product lineup.\n\nThe A16 node process brings numerous improvements compared to the N2P 2-nanometer process node. The A16 node process offers a significant performance boost over the N2P, delivering 8-10% higher speeds while using 15-20% less power. It features a new technology called Super Power Rail that uses the backside power delivery architecture. This frees up space on the front for more data lanes, boosting transistor density and power delivery.\n\nGizchina News of the week Join GizChina on Telegram TSMC and Apple have a good relationship, and it seems likely that Apple will pair up with TSMC for future deals. Hence, Apple may utilize the 1.6nm chip process for the 2026 iPhone 18 models. Meanwhile, TSMC is also working on the 2nm and 1.4nm chips. Apple may use the 2nm process in 2025, but still 3nm for this year According to MacRumors, Apple may utilize TSMC's N3E process based on 3nm for its A18 chip on this year's iPhone. The N3E process will feature improvement over the N3B process used on the A17 Pro chipset. If everything remains good, TSMC is expected to begin the production of the 2nm manufacturing process in the year 2025. Hence, it is expected that the 2025 iPhone 17 series will utilize the 2nm process with the A19 chip. In a nutshell, Apple is expected to make a huge improvement in the year 2026. While this year's iPhone 16 gets the 3nm process with some improvements, and next year's chips get the 2nm process.

        "text": "The US big tech companies once again demonstrated their strong momentum in the first quarter, with the Google parent company, Alphabet, and its rival Microsoft, both surpassing market expectations in their quarterly earnings reports. Alphabet's stocks surged by more than 10%, and Microsoft's shares rose nearly 5% in after-hours trading. The two tech giants are widely seen as the main flag bearers for artificial intelligence (AI), thus providing optimism to the sector. Below are the details of their earnings results and the performance of their respective core businesses in the first quarter.\n\nAlphabet, the parent company of Google, demonstrated robust growth in its core business of advertising sales, propelled by an improved macroeconomic environment and heavy investments in AI technology. Its Google advertising revenue accelerated by 13% year on year to $61.66 billion (€57.4 billion), which accounts for 77% of the overall revenue. The company's total revenue increased by 15% from a year ago, the fastest quarterly growth in two years.\n\nAlphabet reported earnings per share of $1.89 on revenue of $80.54, topping the estimated $1.51 and $78.59 respectively. The two bottom line segments, YouTube advertising, and Google Cloud revenue recorded $8.09 billion and $9.57 billion, beating market expectations of $7.72 billion and $9.35 billion, respectively. The Google Cloud revenue jumped 28% from the same quarter last year.\n\nInvestors cheered for Google Cloud's acceleration as the division generated operating income of $900 million, a substantial increase from $191 million a year ago. Google Cloud holds the third position in market share, trailing behind Amazon's AWS and Microsoft's Azure, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat expressed enthusiasm, stating, \"The main thing is, we are really excited about the benefit from AI for our cloud customers.\" Google invested $12 billion in AI infrastructure, primarily focused on data centres, during the first quarter. CEO Sundar Pichai conveyed confidence in effectively managing the transition to monetisation following these substantial investments.\n\nAnother catalyst contributing to the surge in Alphabet's stock is the announcement of its inaugural cash dividend of 20 cents per share and a $80 billion share buyback plan.\n\nIn the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, Microsoft's core business, the Intelligent Cloud, experienced a notable resurgence. The segment's revenue surged by 21% to reach $26.71 billion (€24.9 billion), primarily buoyed by Azure's 31% year-on-year growth. This significant growth indicates that the company's strategic adoption of AI is yielding substantial returns. Notably, Azure's growth had previously dipped below 30% since the third quarter of fiscal year 2023. However, Microsoft anticipates Azure's growth to maintain a steady pace, projecting it to range between 30% and 31% for the current quarter. Analysts had anticipated a 29% increase in Azure's revenue for both the last quarter and the current one.\n\nMicrosoft's remarkable progress in AI has propelled it to surpass Apple, claiming the title of the world's largest market cap company. The company's overall revenue exceeded expectations, with earnings per share reaching $2.94 on revenue of $61.86 billion, surpassing market forecasts of $2.82 and $60.80 billion, respectively. In addition to the Intelligent Cloud division, both of Microsoft's other segments have seen expansion. Revenue in productivity and business processes, which includes Office software, LinkedIn, and Dynamics 365, grew by 12% year-on-year to $19.6 billion. Meanwhile, revenue in More Personal Computing increased by 17% year-on-year to $15.6 billion. Revenue in More Personal Computing was up 17% year on year to $15.6 billion. Notably, its Xbox revenue surged by 62%, driven primarily by 61 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition.\n\nThis diversification and robust growth across its divisions underscore Microsoft's strong position in the market and its effective utilisation of AI advancements. In the earnings conference call, CEO Satya Nadella highlighted Azure's market share gains, noting that it has been capturing market share from competitors. He specifically mentioned that approximately 60% of Fortune 500 companies are utilising Copilot.\n\nSnap and Intel have also released their first-quarter earnings, with divergent outcomes. Snap's shares soared by more than 20% following an earnings beat and a promising outlook. In contrast, Intel's stocks plummeted nearly 8% due to revenue falling short of expectations and weaker-than-anticipated forecasts for the current quarter.",

He stated, \"Everybody wants casings. If Tata Group is able to do import substitution and they're able to make these machines in India, it will create an industry because so many people want casings. Anybody who wants to make a phone or a tablet in India needs casings and if they're able to adhere to Apple's stringent standards, it would be a high-quality machine in itself.\"\n\nAccording to a source, Indian manufacturers possess varying levels of capability and readiness to implement the plan. This initiative is part of the company's global strategy to decrease reliance on specific low-tech components before transitioning to more intricate parts. The objective is to diversify and mitigate risks associated with global supply chain disruptions while simultaneously fostering the manufacturing ecosystem within the country.\n\nAlso Read | 5 lakh 'Apployments': Apple ecosystem to create huge number of jobs in 3 years; iPhone maker may move half its supply chain from China to India\n\nThe source mentioned that although Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machines are widely used across various sectors in India, domestic manufacturers currently lack the capability to utilize CNC machines for precision components.\n\nThe person stated that diversifying and de-risking the supply chain is a priority for all stakeholders, including the government, manufacturers like the Tata Group, and the companies themselves.

This latest offering for iOS users has allowed them to play classic old-school retro games. This recent development has made gamers take a trip down to nostalgia and eventually make this one of the hottest apps in the App Store at the moment. The craze among people to emulate retro games on their iPhones is now reminding them of their childhood which was linked to Nintendo's addictive games.\n\nEmulators for Androids are not that big of a deal but when it comes to iOS, it is quite a big deal as Apple did not allow such apps on its Play Store due to the violation of rules. However, now the tech giant has had a slight change of heart due to European regulation and the launch of third-party app stores on the iPhone. According to the experts, this decision of Apple not only allows game emulation on the App Store but also pushes for a more open future on the iPhone, despite the legal issues around ROMs and how emulation works.\n\nAn emulator in simpler words is software or hardware which emulates or imitates a video game console. The idea behind this is to match the gaming experience of the original hardware or software.\n\nIt allows one to play retro Nintendo, Saga and Sony PlayStation games on their PC or smartphones. Users this way can play games from a vintage console without owning the physical device.\n\nDelta to be specific is a video game emulator for the iPhone that was recently launched on Apple Play Store. It is one of the first officially Apple-approved iOS apps to emulate a number of old Nintendo consoles, including the Nintendo Entertainment System, Nintendo Game Boy, and Nintendo N64, among others. The developer of this, Riley Testut released a sideloadable GBA4iOS project but it violated the rules of Apple due to which the tech giant struck it down from the platform.\n\nDelta, on the other hand, can be downloaded directly from the App Store without having to worry about sideloading. It is built with iOS through and through and it integrates some useful features that were designed for the iPhone. It even supports third-party controllers along with quick saves, cheat codes and data syncing between devices using Google Drive or Dropbox.\n\nOnce downloaded, you will have to download your desired games as it does not come with any games. You will have to download the ROM files of the games either via iTunes file syncing or a connection to Google Drive or Dropbox.\n\nROM files of plenty of retro games are easily accessible but, many of them are also protected by copyright law and downloading them is technically illegal. It will be recommended to always proceed with DMCA-free titles created by enthusiasts, or dump games that you already own into ROM files.\n\nOnce loaded, some original artwork for your game in Delta's library is visible. Delta automatically separates games based on the consoles they run on. Users get an idea of what t play by looking at games from different generations of consoles. Each console emulator on Delta (for example, Nintendo Game Boy) has its own skin and controller.\n\nDelta also allows you to download several fan-made \"controller skins\" with which you can change the default look of on-screen controllers. The touchscreen controls do a good job. Since iOS supports a number of controllers so it is possible to play retro games using modern physical game controllers. The good thing probably about the Delta app is that you can easily save your game at any point and them just resume it later at any specific moment.",

        "text": "Apple is preparing to surprise iPhone enthusiasts again with the launch of the iPhone 16 series. The leaks and rumours surrounding the upcoming smartphone have already sparked a lot of excitement among iPhone fans. The upcoming iPhone 16 series models are rumoured to feature a buttonless design. The same was previously rumoured for the iPhone 15 series. But a new leak claims that Apple is planning to revolutionise its flagship device by dumping physical buttons for capacitive buttons with haptic feedback.\n\nCapacitive Button On Cards?\n\nAccording to a report from Asia's Economic Daily News, Apple has received a large order from Taiwanese supplier Advanced Semiconductor Engineering for capacitive button components. These components would be intended to be integrated into the iPhone 16 series, as per the report.\n\nThe capacitive versions that use haptic feedback technology could replace the traditional physical buttons on the sides of the iPhone. These buttons will provide an interaction paradigm for users by sensing pressure and simulating the sensation of pressing a physical button through vibrations created by Taptic Engines.\n\nALSO READ: iPhone 16 Series May Offer AI Feature, Fast Performance; Know More Details\n\nNew Vs Old Rumours\n\nBut even if the report generates excitement, it should be taken with a pinch of salt. The order for capacitive components could be part of Apple's production strategy and not an indication of an implementation in the iPhone 16 lineup.\n\nMacRumors' findings shed light on Apple's previous experiments with haptic power and volume buttons on iPhones. The project, called \"Project Bongo,\" is said to be aimed to redefine the user experience through innovative button designs. However, the project was scrapped in 2023 due to technical hurdles, which resulted in the use of mechanical buttons on the iPhone 16. However, the new report claims in contrast to this.\n\nAdditionally, previous leaks suggest that iPhone 16 models could retain mechanical buttons, with speculation that a fourth button would be added for camera functions. This feature, referred to as the \"Capture Button,\" is claimed to ensure quick photo and video capture capabilities.",

        "text": "Huawei's new phone sports the latest version of a China-made chip - Caixin Global\n\nIt looks like Samsung is ditching the Watch 7 Pro rumors and launching into an all-new smartwatch named the Galaxy Watch Ultra. While we don't know if Samsung will unveil the Watch 7 Pro in the next-gen Watch 7 series, one thing we can say for sure is that Samsung will indeed introduce an all-new smartwatch called the Galaxy Watch Ultra.\n\nPreviously, details regarding the battery size of the Galaxy Watch 7 Pro surfaced. According to the latest findings from our database, Samsung may introduce the Watch Ultra instead of the Watch 7 Pro. We expect Samsung to unveil three new watches: the Watch 7, Watch 7 Classic, and Watch Ultra.\n\nPrevious reports pointed to a larger battery (578 mAh) for an upcoming Galaxy Watch with model number EB-BL705ABY. While we were waiting for three new watches (Watch 7, Watch 7 Classic and Watch Ultra), Samsung might skip the Classic model as Samsung previously skipped the Classic model with the Watch5 series. Our database reveals three distinct model numbers (SM-L705U, SM-L705N, and SM-L705F) for the upcoming Galaxy Watch Ultra. These model numbers represent United States, Korea and Worldwide. The new Watch Ultra will officially launch in several regions.\n\nWe know that the Galaxy Watch FE will feature similar features to the Galaxy Watch4 introduced in 2021. The Galaxy Watch4 still holds up quite well even in 2024. It's great to see Samsung introducing an affordable watch model, as the budget of everything world is not enough for a smart watch. . Since many high-end smartwatches cost almost the same as a mid-range Android smartphone, it makes sense for companies to introduce an affordable alternative smartwatch.\n\nSamsung is also expected to launch the Samsung Galaxy Watch FE in the coming months. This naming strategy reflects Apple's recent approach with the Apple Watch Ultra and Apple Watch SE. Samsung's Watch FE will be a more economical alternative to the Watch Ultra. As previously mentioned in our Galaxy Watch FE review, the Galaxy Watch FE will be available with specific models (SM-R866F, SM-R866U, and SM-R866N) for the United States, Korea, and other markets. The watch is expected to share features with the popular Galaxy Watch4 (2021).\n\nPhones and smartwatches have undoubtedly made everyone's life easier. Especially if you exercise frequently, tracking your physical activity can be very beneficial. Despite their relatively limited functions, smart watches remain expensive. However, Samsung's decision to introduce the Watch FE as an alternative to the Watch Ultra is a commendable step.\n\nWe can expect significant differences between the Watch Ultra and the Watch FE, although we don't currently have exact technical specifications for either watch. Samsung could surprise us this year by presenting a very advanced smart watch. The Watch Ultra could feature advanced sensors enabling more precise tracking of training activities, such as providing more accurate data during swimming thanks to increased durability against water pressure. Additionally, it could provide more accurate GPS tracking. It's safe to say that the Watch Ultra's battery life will be significantly better, as Samsung plans to use a much bigger battery than ever before in its next smartwatch.",

The company, which does not directly purchase, procure or source primary minerals, has been openly auditing its suppliers for several years and publishing its findings.\n\nIn a report last year, it said that 100% of identified smelters and refiners in the supply chain for all applicable Apple products manufactured in 2023 had participated in an independent third-party conflict minerals audit for 3T minerals and gold (3TG).\n\n\"We found no reasonable basis for concluding that any of the smelters or refiners of 3TG determined to be in our supply chain as of December 31, 2023 directly or indirectly financed or benefited armed groups in the DRC or an adjoining country,\" the Apple report said.\n\nThe Amsterdam statement coincided with the release of a report by the law firm accusing Rwanda and private entities of laundering 3T and other conflict minerals from Congo.\n\nRwanda and Congo's governments did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nCongo is the world's leading producer of tantalum, followed by Rwanda. It is also the number one producer of copper and cobalt, a key ingredient in electric batteries.\n\nMost of Congo's mineral resources are concentrated in the east, where insecurity has worsened since a rebel group known as the M23 made a major comeback in March 2022.",

Without these links, users in the EU have to manually visit the Spotify website through a web browser if they want to purchase the subscription plans at a lower price.\n\n\"Apple has once again challenged the decision of the European Commission, rejecting our update for trying to communicate our prices to customers unless we pay Apple a new tax,\" a Spotify spokesperson told TechCrunch. \"Their disregard for consumers and developers is only comparable to their disdain for the law.\"\n\nSpotify has stated that it will not comply with the changes introduced by Apple with the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which charges a \"basic technology fee\" to developers with more than one million annual downloads.

They were also joined in the studio by sports correspondent Mike Bushell and weather forecaster Matt Taylor.\n\nDuring his sports segment, Mike dished out the latest golf news and explained that an alligator caused a game to come to a halt in New Orleans due to walking on the golf course. He then mentioned that he would rather the alligator, than baboons, who are known to pinch balls during games.\n\nMike said: \"I think I'd rather have alligators holding up play than cheeky baboons like in South Africa where they actually have baboon monitors to stop the baboons pinching your balls.\" The studio then descended into silence.\n\nCharlie giggled and said: \"That's a tough job isn't it?\". He then chimed: \" I wouldn't want that job! You got to be careful around Baboons.\"\n\nMike then told Charlie that he is \"usually\" everyday- while appearing to allude that he needs to be careful around certain people in the office. When Charlie then asked Matt if he was also \"careful\" around baboons, the forecaster gave a tame response and said: \"I can't say I'm the same sort of as Mike.\"\n\nMike then told Matt that he would give \"tips\". Naga then awkwardly said to weather presenter: \"What? avoiding baboons pinching your balls?\"\n\nMatt replied: \"I've not had that, no.

The driver trusted the machine to drive for him.\"\n\nWashington State Patrol Captain Deion Glover said: \"It's still in the early stages of investigation as a lot of unknowns are still out there.\" Investigations are underway to find out if the car was in autopilot mode or if the death occurred solely due to the driver's fault.\n\nThis is not the first case of problems arising in the Tesla autopilot system.\n\nIn December last year, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced that more than two million Tesla cars in autopilot mode faced issues.\n\nEarlier this month, Tesla settled a wrongful death lawsuit involving an Apple engineer who veered off a highway while on the autopilot system, leading to his death.",

        "text": "Once again, September appears marked in deep red on Apple's internal calendar. They have already launched the Vision Pro on the market, also some renewed MacBook Air M3 and will soon launch new iPads. But let's not fool ourselves, the star of the catalog is still the iPhone and this year it's time to meet the iPhone 16.\n\nThus, being just over four months away from knowing them, Apple has practically finalized them to begin mass production. Thanks to the leaks we can anticipate what the new iPhone 16 and 16 Pro will be like and, as far as design is concerned, we already anticipated that they will not be huge changes. Apple is not characterized by this, with exceptions such as the iPhone X, although that does not mean that they will be identical to their predecessors.\n\nWithout ever leaving the upper left corner of the back of the iPhone, since the iPhone 7 Plus that debuted the dual camera, Apple has been varying its position. Sometimes with compelling reasons such as softening the impact when changing from one lens to another and other times, why not say it, for commercial reasons of differentiation between one generation and another. This is how we have seen that they become horizontal, then vertical, then diagonal and now again indicates that they will return to a vertical format on the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus. A format reminiscent of the iPhone X and iPhone 11.\n\nThe unofficial reason for this change is in the space video recording which it already seems that all iPhones will have from now on. A three-dimensional video format aimed at being consumed on a Vision Pro and that can now be recorded with an iPhone 15 Pro or 15 Pro Max. Although Apple still needs to explain the details, it is assumed that placing the module in this way will favor this recording. Besides, of course, it gives a somewhat different look to a range that has been the same since the iPhone 13 and 13 mini.\n\nOn the side we will also see the action button. It is not a new element at Apple, since it was released in the 'Pro' models last year. However, the standard and 'Plus' range has continued with the classic switch to silence the iPhone and in this new generation it will already be common, being able to customize that button so that it provides other functions beyond silencing the device.\n\nNew colors are also expected As happens every year, this is the most colorful iPhone range compared to the 'Pro'. But little more. Although it is possible that the dimensions may vary slightly, the truth is that no major changes are expected. Both will come with identical screen sizes to the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus, that is, 6.1 and 6.7-inch OLED panels that, yes, we would like them to go to 120 Hz, although to be honest, nothing aim for this and that they continue at 60 Hz is the most possible according to the information we have at this moment.\n\nGoing a little to the point, we will say that at first glance it will be difficult for you to differentiate an iPhone 16 Pro or 16 Pro Max from its predecessors. And we are no longer just talking about distinguishing them from an iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max, but even from an iPhone 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max. Yes, they will have the dynamic island that does differentiate them from those older generations. Also a triple rear camera that will continue to grow as has happened in each new generation. However, In essence they will be very similar.\n\nThe big difference will be in the size, since it is expected that They now have a 6.3 and 6.9 inch screen, the latter (the 16 Pro Max) being the largest iPhone in history. We do not know for sure if this will increase their dimensions somewhat or if, on the contrary, they will obtain that increase in size thanks to the reduction of front bezels that were already sparse in the last generation.\n\nAnother visible novelty is on the right side (if we look at it from the front), since will have a new button facing the camera. Something like the action button released in the last generation, but on the other side and with a very specific function with the 'Camera' app, although we still do not know how and if it will be customizable to reach specific functions within the app and even help us during the capture.\n\nThe volume buttons also point to receive changes. A recent leak from the Economic Daily News reveals that what was already leaked for the iPhone 15 Pro and that we finally did not see because, presumably, the quality standards required by Apple had not been met. It would basically be about eliminating the classic physical buttons to add haptic buttons that would work identically to the previous ones, even giving a sensation of pressing, but as happened with the iPhone 7 button, nothing will really be activated, since it will be a simple sensation that will be achieved through a vibration emitted when touching them.\n\nIt is not known exactly why Apple is so determined and whether for visual purposes there will be two buttons identical to the ones we already have. And it is speculated that It could also be some kind of slider bar in which, instead of pressing a button to increase or decrease the volume, we slide down or up to do the same. Similar to what we see in headphones like the AirPods Pro and AirPods Pro 2 on their temples.\n\nOf course, not everything has been said. And if we talk about official information, much less. Apple does not usually reveal anything about its upcoming devices until it officially presents them. With the iPhone 16 family the story will not change. In any case, these changes have many reasons to end up being true due to the sources that have been confirming them over the last few months.\n\nNow, this does not mean that they will be exactly like that. Apple can still change its mind for any reason, as happened last year precisely with the haptic buttons on the iPhone 15 Pro. Likewise, it also there may be some unfiltered features or not at least exact, as also happened with the dynamic island of the iPhone 14 Pro, which no one foresaw would be like this.",

The leaks and rumours surrounding the upcoming smartphone have already sparked a lot of excitement among iPhone fans. The upcoming iPhone 16 series models are rumoured to feature a buttonless design. The same was previously rumoured for the iPhone 15 series. But a new leak claims that Apple is planning to revolutionise its flagship device by dumping physical buttons for capacitive buttons with haptic feedback.\n\nCapacitive Button On Cards?\n\nAccording to a report from Asia's Economic Daily News, Apple has received a large order from Taiwanese supplier Advanced Semiconductor Engineering for capacitive button components. These components would be intended to be integrated into the iPhone 16 series, as per the report.\n\nThe capacitive versions that use haptic feedback technology could replace the traditional physical buttons on the sides of the iPhone. These buttons will provide an interaction paradigm for users by sensing pressure and simulating the sensation of pressing a physical button through vibrations created by Taptic Engines.\n\nALSO READ: iPhone 16 Series May Offer AI Feature, Fast Performance; Know More Details\n\nNew Vs Old Rumours\n\nBut even if the report generates excitement, it should be taken with a pinch of salt. The order for capacitive components could be part of Apple's production strategy and not an indication of an implementation in the iPhone 16 lineup.\n\nMacRumors' findings shed light on Apple's previous experiments with haptic power and volume buttons on iPhones. The project, called \"Project Bongo,\" is said to be aimed to redefine the user experience through innovative button designs. However, the project was scrapped in 2023 due to technical hurdles, which resulted in the use of mechanical buttons on the iPhone 16. However, the new report claims in contrast to this.\n\nAdditionally, previous leaks suggest that iPhone 16 models could retain mechanical buttons, with speculation that a fourth button would be added for camera functions. This feature, referred to as the \"Capture Button,\" is claimed to ensure quick photo and video capture capabilities.",

        "text": "In mid-April 2024, Meta -- the multibillion-dollar Facebook parent company -- accepted money from advertisers promoting false claims that American rapper and actor Jaden Smith and British actor Rowan Atkinson had died. People who clicked thumbnails displaying the death hoaxes were taken to scam pages with alleged malware alerts and a phone number to share personal information.\n\nWe contacted Facebook and will update this story if we receive a response.\n\nThe ad featuring Smith read, \"We are so sad to inform you that Jaden Smith is no longer with us.\" The ad also shared a link with the misleading headline, \"TMZ Live News Updates: 'Karate Kid' actor Jaden Smith, the son of Will Smith, end [sic] his life after announcing that he is....\"\n\nJaden Smith gained fame as a child following the release of the 2006 film, \"The Pursuit of Happyness,\" which also featured his dad. Additionally, the younger Smith starred in the 2010 movie \"The Karate Kid\" alongside Jackie Chan. Meanwhile, he's been the subject of death hoaxes over the the years. Snopes has debunked several rumors falsely claiming that Jaden Smith had died.\n\nSeparately, the ad about Atkinson read, \"We are so sad to inform you that Mr. Bean is no longer with us.\" Atkinson is known for creating and portraying the character Mr. Bean. Like with Jaden Smith, we've previously reported on false claims that Atkinson had died.\n\nThe Ads Led to Predatory Scams\n\nThe ads displaying the death hoaxes about Smith and Atkinson were trying to get users to click -- a step that would take them to a malicious website displaying alleged malware alerts. It was possible that additional predatory ads using the likeness of other celebrities to try to get people's attention existed on Facebook, as of this writing. We discovered the ads featuring Smith and Atkinson in one of our own feeds.\n\nAfter clicking the death hoax ads about Smith and Atkinson, we analyzed the website that was attempting to scare people into believing \"Apple Security Centre,\" \"MacOS Secure Services,\" \"Microsoft Support,\" \"Windows Defender Scan\" or some other service had detected a virus called \"Ads.fiancetrack(2).dll\" on their device. The website then displayed one of several phone numbers to allegedly help. Then, that phone number connected victims with scammers pretending to be representatives of Apple, Geek Squad, McAfee, Microsoft, Norton or some other supposedly trustworthy computer-security company.\n\nScammers Ask Victims About Pornhub.com\n\nWe dialed one of the displayed phone numbers to document how the scam worked. On the phone call, the scammer pretended she was able to scan one of our Wi-Fi networks despite not being given any information about who we were or how it could be accessed. Then, the scammer claimed she was able to detect criminal activity on the network, asking if we had accessed Pornhub.com to view child pornography the previous day at 5 a.m. She claimed hackers must have done this, and she said she would immediately request the Federal Communications Commission to conduct a \"secret\" investigation into the matter.\n\nThis appeared to be part of one or more scripts repeated to people who called the phone numbers.\n\nThe Scammers' Goal: Stealing Money\n\nIn scams like these, organizers attempt to deceive users on the phone into providing access to a device or an account, and then they use that access to steal money from bank accounts or digital payment services such as Cash App, PayPal, Venmo, Zelle and others. The scammers often ask a user to visit a website that allows them remote access to the victim's device, supposedly to help resolve the fake malware threat.\n\nIf any readers have fallen for this scam, we recommend immediately contacting credible phone numbers on official websites for banks, credit card companies and payment services with access to your finances. Change your login credentials to make sure your accounts are safe and secure.\n\nFacebook Error Says 'Not Currently Running Ads'\n\nA fake Facebook profile named \"Pam Williamson\" displayed one of the above-mentioned Facebook ads. We visited that profile's \"page transparency\" section, which said, \"This Page is not currently running ads.\"\n\nThis was incorrect. The ad had appeared in one of our own feeds just seconds earlier. This same issue with Facebook claiming a page \"is not currently running ads\" -- when its ads are still active -- is a problem we've noticed many times in the past. When this message is displayed on a Facebook profile, it means users -- including investigative journalists -- are unable to properly research Meta's advertising library.\n\nThousands of Paid-For Scam Ads\n\nFacebook has hosted ads with links that lead to fake threat-detection pop-up websites -- like the Jaden Smith and Atkinson ads -- since at least 2023. We previously documented a similar scam on a desktop version of Facebook in January 2024. In that case, one of many right-column, paid-for Facebook ads were misleadingly designed to resemble Facebook notifications.\n\nIn recent years, Snopes has seen first-hand the fact Meta approved and then displayed to users at least thousands of paid-for scam ads.\n\n\"Jaden Smith.\" IMDb.com, https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1535523/.\n\nOrtutay, Barbara. \"Meta Posts Sharp Profit, Revenue Increase in Q4 Thanks to Cost Cuts and Advertising Rebound.\" The Associated Press, 1 Feb. 2024, https://apnews.com/article/meta-facebook-instagram-earnings-revenue-profit-abc3e389d97fb97c661ccb6acfcf65c7.\n\n\"Registration Data Lookup Tool.\" ICANN.org, https://lookup.icann.org/en/lookup.\n\n\"Rowan Atkinson | Biography, Movies, TV Shows, & Facts.\" Britannica, https://www.britannica.com/biography/Rowan-Atkinson.",

The penalty can rise to 30 percent if the malpractice continues.\n\nThe new penalty is more than three times the penalty under the existing antimonopoly law, which imposes levies worth 6 percent of revenue gained through anti-competitive practices.\n\n\"Smartphones have become the foundation of people's lives and economic activities,\" Hanako Jimi, minister for consumer affairs, said at a press conference. \"We will strive to offer more options to consumers while ensuring security.\"\n\nThe bill follows a similar law in the European Union that took effect in March.\n\nThe Japanese government seeks to align with the bloc in stepping up regulation of Big Tech firms such as Apple, Google and Amazon.com Inc., which have grown to wield significant influence over digital services around the world.",

If you're an iOS user the best phone you can buy is the iPhone 15 Pro. It has an A17 Pro processor, a new main camera with a larger and higher-megapixel sensor, a new Action button and the Dynamic Island -- a display cutout that shows system alerts and background activities.\n\nIf you're on Android, your best bet is the $800 Samsung Galaxy S24. The battery life is amazing. But that's not the only reason it's the best Android phone. It gets seven years of major Android updates, the cameras are good (there's even a 3x telephoto lens for zooming). And then there are all the AI features. Samsung didn't reinvent the phone, but it did take a great phone (the Galaxy S23) and make it better.\n\nNearly every phone from Apple, Samsung and Google is 5G-ready. That means these smartphones come equipped to deliver the fastest possible data speeds across your wireless network. And while they tend to be pricey, there are plenty of aff ordable 5G options like the Google Pixel 6A and Apple's cheapest, the 2022 iPhone SE.\n\nPeople are also reading...

All these upgrades come together to make for an experience that feels fresh and fast compared with older generations. Starting at $999, it's the most expensive iPhone you can buy, especially if you opt for the larger Max version ($1,199), but if you want the high performance and stellar camera quality of Apple's top phone, then the iPhone 15 Pro is for you.\n\nBEST ANDROID PHONE FOR MOS PEOPLE\n\nSamsung Galaxy S24\n\nWhat's most impressive about the Samsung Galaxy S24 isn't the new Galaxy AI features, brighter screens or solid cameras. It's the battery life. The larger battery in the Galaxy S24 has no trouble plowing through a long day of use on a single charge.\n\nThe S24 is a wonderful, well-built phone that is excellent right out of the box, just as the nearly identical S22 and S23 were before it. This similarity to the S22 and S23 can be viewed as either a strength, because the design reflects three years of refinements, or a weakness, because features like the camera hardware are essentially identical to what came out in 2022.\n\nBut all of this is overshadowed by the great battery life. You'll never hear anyone complain about getting too much battery life.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 5\n\nThe Galaxy Z Flip 5 is the biggest leap forward Samsung's flip phone has seen in years. Samsung has significantly expanded the size of the cover screen located on the outside of the device, meaning you can look up directions, take photos and send messages without opening the phone. It's this combined with the Z Flip's solid battery life and sturdy design that makes it a top pick.\n\nThe Z Flip 5 may be the top flip phone, but there are still some drawbacks to be aware of. At $1,000, it's still expensive for a phone without a telephoto camera. And not all apps work natively on the front screen, as they do on the Motorola Razr Plus.\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Telephony Telecommunications Computer Science Photography Software Business Computer Monitor Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.",

Apple has been diligently working on AI for quite some time.\n\nKnown for its culture of secrecy, Apple has kept much of its AI endeavors under wraps. However, recent developments shed light on its ambitious plans.\n\nApple recently unveiled a new generative AI model called OpenELM, which reportedly surpasses several other language models trained on public data, according to reports from Indian Express.\n\nOpenELM comprises a series of compact open-source language models specifically designed to operate efficiently on devices like iPhones and Macs.\n\nApple asserts that OpenELM represents cutting-edge technology, employing a strategy known as layer-wise scaling to optimise parameter allocation within each layer of the transformer model, leading to improved accuracy.\n\nThis model family, optimised for on-device usage, enables AI tasks to be performed without relying heavily on cloud servers.\n\nOpenELM has been trained on CoreNet, an open-source library, alongside other models, facilitating efficient inference and fine-tuning on Apple devices.\n\nIn a research paper, they stated, \"We also provide code to convert models to MLX library for inference and fine-tuning on Apple devices. This extensive release aims to empower and bolster the open research community, laying the groundwork for future research endeavors.\"\n\nAccording to reports, OpenELM is slated for release ahead of the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) scheduled for June 2024.",

Meanwhile, the company's net income was $21.9bn, with a similar year-over-year growth of 20pc. Microsoft's operating income and diluted earnings per share also rose by 23pc and 20pc respectively.\n\nMicrosoft was one of the key backers of OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT which fanned the flames of the global AI surge.

Microsoft Cloud grew by 23pc in the last quarter, while Azure and other cloud services rose by 33pc.\n\nBut some have issue with Big Tech players like Microsoft gaining too much control in the cloud market. Mark Boost, the CEO of cloud computing company Civo said hyperscalers are benefitting from \"anti-competitive practices\" such as \"combining enticing free credit schemes with excessive egress fees\".\n\n\"A monopoly is forming, which is damaging the ecosystem and ultimately breaking cloud,\" Boost said. \"We need to see action that prevents these damaging practices. Otherwise, Big Tech's coffers will continue to grow at the cost of customers and the whole cloud ecosystem.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Microsoft's Xbox division saw a massive surge in the last quarter compared to last year, rising by 62pc. This was likely boosted by Microsoft's massive acquisition of Activision-Blizzard, which the company completed last October.\n\nGoogle cloud on the rise\n\nAlphabet also reported a very strong quarter, as its revenue grew by 15pc year-over-year to $80.5bn. The company's net income surged to $23.7bn, an increase of 57pc.\n\nThe success of the last quarter seems to have spurred the tech giant into announcing its first ever dividend. The company said it intends to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future - subject to review.\n\nLike Microsoft, Google Cloud also had a strong quarter, rising by 28pc to reach revenue of $9.6bn. Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai said the latest quarter showed strong performance \"from Search, YouTube and Cloud\".\n\n\"We are well under way with our Gemini era and there's great momentum across the company,\" Pichai said. \"Our leadership in AI research and infrastructure and our global product footprint position us well for the next wave of AI innovation.\"\n\nForrester senior analyst Nikhil Lai noted that the same quarter in 2023 occurred during \"macroeconomic and advertisers' uncertainty\", making the year-over-year comparisons \"favourable\" for the company.\n\n\"Results are more a lagging indicator of consumers' confidence than leading indicators of what's to come,\" Lai said.\n\nFind out how emerging tech trends are transforming tomorrow with our new podcast, Future Human: The Series.

        "text": "Almost a decade ago, pediatrician Mona Hanna-Attisha took to a podium in Flint, Mich. and demanded that the world pay attention to an unfolding water crisis.\n\nThe city of Flint was near bankruptcy and controlled by emergency financial managers. To save money, officials decided to switch the municipal water source from Lake Huron to the Flint River on April 25th, 2014. Flint is a majority-Black city, and at the time, an estimated 40% of residents lived in poverty. Many immediately noticed a difference in their water quality.\n\n\"We had greenish and brownish water. It smelled weird. It was giving people's rashes and they were losing hair. Patients were asking, 'Was it okay to use this tap water to mix their babies' formula?\" Dr. Hanna-Attisha recalls.\n\nState and city officials reassured Flint residents that the water was safe. That wasn't true.\n\nElin Betanzo, a former employee of the Environmental Protection Agency had also seen a lead crisis unfold in Washington D.C. in 2004. Betanzo implored Hanna-Attisha, a friend from high school, to look into the issue.\n\n\"She literally stared me down like, 'Mona, the water doesn't have corrosion control.' That is the moment that I heard about the possibility of lead being in the water. And that's the moment my life changed,\" Hanna-Attisha remembers.\n\nCorrosion control changes the chemistry of the water to make it less likely for any material in the pipes to leach into the water. Without that corrosion control, the lead in Flint's pipes got into the water supply of tens of thousands of residents.\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention says no amount of lead in children is safe. Lead poisoning in young children can damage their brains and nervous systems, cause learning and behavioral problems, and harm hearing and speech. In adults, lead exposure is associated with kidney damage, high blood pressure and cardiovascular problems.\n\nAfter the water source change, Dr. Hanna-Attisha saw a crisis in the making and began looking for data to prove it. On September 24, 2015, a year-and-a-half after that water switch, she went public with her results. They showed that the percentage of children in Flint with elevated levels of lead in their blood had gone up.\n\nAt first, the state dismissed her findings. But Hanna-Attisha was right.\n\nToday, Hanna-Attisha is the founding director of the Pediatric Public Health Initiative, which connects Flint families to programs aimed to alleviate poverty, support education and improve health outcomes. Rx Kids is a cash-transfer program gives new moms in Flint a no-strings-attached check of $7500.\n\n\"In a city that so many folks know as a city that failed kids, Flint is a city that's learning, that's leading with science. That's leading with prevention to promote the healthy development of kids by boldly eradicating infant poverty,\" she says.\n\nIn the last decade, the city's water quality has improved. Thousands of lead pipes in Flint have been replaced, but not all. That means that not every resident in Flint has clean, fresh water.\n\nIt's a problem goes well beyond Flint.\n\nCities and towns all over the United States are facing their own issues with water quality, aging infrastructure and inadequate lead safety protections.\n\nA 2023 report from the EPA revealed that in 2021, lead made up 9% of the nation's service line infrastructure, representing an estimated 9.2 million pipes. Half of those pipes are concentrated in six states: Florida, Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and New York.\n\nIn Chicago alone, 400,000 homes still get their tap water through lead service lines. A recent study published in JAMA Pediatrics found that nearly 70% of young children in the city are exposed to lead through their home tap water. The study also found that Black and Hispanic neighborhoods are more likely to have lead exposure, but less likely to be tested for lead.\n\nThe Lead and Copper Rule -- first issued by the EPA in 1991 -- requires local water systems with over 15 parts per billion of lead in the water to initiate corrosion control. But about 90% of cases where local water systems exceeded these limits never got reported to the federal government, according to EPA audits.\n\n\"This was probably the worst reported and enforced regulation in the history of the drinking water program,\" says Elizabeth Southerland, former director of the Office of Science and Technology in the Office of Water at EPA and a current member of the Environmental Protection Network.\n\nIn November 2023, the EPA proposed Lead and Copper Rule Improvements, among them:\n\nChicago, however, would get an exemption to the 10-year timeline, as it would take an estimated 40 years to replace the 400,000 pipes.\n\n\"That's decades. That's generations of children and adults consuming lead contaminated water. It's incomprehensible to tell a resident that they need to wait that long for safe drinking water,\" said Chakena Perry with the Natural Resources Defense Council.\n\nPerry and others are pushing for the EPA to close up those exemptions when the rule changes are finalized this fall.\n\nHave questions or comments for us to consider for a future episode?

And that's why cash-strapped Apple users looking for a new wearable should skip the Watch Series 9 and pick the Watch Series 8 at Walmart instead. If you want to score $200 in savings, that is.\n\nAlthough not witnessed for the first time, the current deal is still quite extravagant, as it doesn't often go live. In fact, we've last seen it almost two months ago! What's more, you won't find the Apple smartwatch at the same price on Amazon. So, if you're short on cash but want to replace your old wearable with a high-quality timepiece, don't sleep on it and go for Walmart's offer.\n\nBy the way, it's not just the larger-sized variant that sees deep discounts at the e-commerce store. Users with smaller wrists can opt for the 41mm model. This one also arrives at $200 off its MSRP of $499, and it's 4G-ready, too.\n\nTrue, this isn't the latest model from Apple's wearable lineup. But, as we've noted in our Watch Series 8 vs. Watch Series 9 review, the newer model doesn't offer that many upgrades. In such a case, do you really need to splurge on the Watch Series 9 when you can get the cellular-enabled predecessor for as little as $299? Probably not.\n\nThe Watch Series 8 looks exactly like its successor, though it lacks the extra bright screen. Nevertheless, with a peak brightness of 1,000 nits, this puppy's Liquid Retina display is more than visible even under the blazing sun.\n\nThe timepiece also packs a set of neat features, including but not limited to heart rate tracking, an ECG app, Crash Detection, women's health insights, and activity tracking. True, this one doesn't get the fancy new double-tap feature. Then again, so long as you aren't obsessed with the latest bells and whistles in Apple's wearable technology, you can easily go without this one.\n\nBattery-wise, this bad boy gives you just what Apple has been offering for some time now - 18 hours of use between charges. That's exactly how much the newer model keeps the lights on before you need to stop for a recharge, mind you.",

Initially, speculation pointed towards a 12.9-inch iPad Air featuring a mini-LED panel. However, recent insights from Ross Young suggest otherwise.\n\nApple is expected to refresh its iPad lineup soon with new iPad Pro and iPad Air models. The tech giant is tipped to introduce new iPad Air in 10.9-inch and 12.9-inch models. Ross Young of Display Supply Chain Consultants (DSCC) previously tipped the smaller model to continue using the LCD panel while predicting the larger iPad Air to feature a mini-LED panel like the current 12.9-inch iPad Pro. However, the analyst now contradicts this claim and suggests that the larger iPad Air will also feature an LCD panel like its smaller sibling. Let's get into the details.\n\nEarlier this month, Young said that the 12.9-inch iPad Air would feature leftover mini-LED panels from the iPad Pro of the same size, while the new Pro models upgrade to the OLED panels. The mini-LED panels on the iPad Air would have provided deeper blacks, increased brightness for HDR content, and lower power consumption.\n\nHowever, Young now says that Apple no longer plans to upgrade the screen on the 12.9-inch iPad Air. In a post to subscribers on X (formerly Twitter- via MacRumors), he says that the high cost of the mini-LED panel is the reason behind Apple's decision to stick to an LCD panel for the iPad Air 12.9-inch model. As a result, both iPad Air models will feature LCD like the current Air models.\n\nGoing forward, Young expects Apple to introduce a new iPad model with a 12.9-inch mini-LED panel in the fourth quarter of 2024. The new device could be a high-end iPad Air, a low-end iPad Pro, or something else. Apple is expected to launch the new generation of iPad Air and iPad Pro models at its May 7 event. It is also expected to launch a new Magic Keyboard and a new Apple Pencil with support for MagSafe wireless charging.",

You can also voice control any smart appliances and Internet of Things goods you own. Naturally, the more features a smart speaker has, the better. However, since audio content is typically the primary use case for a smart speaker, you also need to ensure that the device sounds excellent.\n\nBecause smart speakers rely on good voice assistant technology, they are still primarily available from a small number of brands. However, with Google and Amazon offering access to their voice assistants to other businesses, many more options are now accessible across price ranges. Before we go into our recommendations of Top Smart Speakers with Must-Have Features in India, let us know what a smart speaker is.\n\nDefining a speaker is optional, but explaining what a smart speaker is and how it differs from a regular wired or wireless speaker or speaker system is crucial. It can also use this Internet access for various purposes, such as giving basic information, managing smart home products like light bulbs, air purifiers, and cleaning robots, and even using domestic tools and utilities like alarms, timers, and reminders. Many smart speakers include Bluetooth connectivity, allowing them to be used as standard Bluetooth speakers.\n\nA wall socket must power most smart speakers since they lack a built-in battery. Some smart speakers include a built-in battery and can work remotely, but this is rare in the market.\n\nAlthough the Echo smart speaker collection includes numerous gadgets, none match the Amazon Echo Studio. The Amazon Echo Studio, priced at Rs. 22,999, is one of the smartest speakers available in India today.\n\nWith a fantastic five-driver system that includes three mid-range speakers, one tweeter, and one subwoofer, the Amazon Echo Studio produces powerful, crisp, and compelling music that far outperforms everything else in the segment. Combining this with the perks of Amazon's Alexa speech assistant gives you a smart speaker that can do almost anything and sounds fantastic. You can even wirelessly connect the Amazon Echo Studio to a Fire TV device, allowing you to utilise it as a television sound system.\n\nPerhaps the only real disadvantage is the price; for the same money, you can get a decent soundbar or speaker system, and despite its many advantages, the Echo Studio is still only a single speaker. However, it is the loudest and best-sounding single-box smart solution. It deserves to be among our top recommendations of Top Smart Speakers with Must-Have Features in India.\n\nIt is uncommon to come across a device with no substantial downsides, and the Google Nest Audio is one such smart speaker. Although comparable to the Google Home smart speaker line, the Rs. 5,655 Google Nest Audio is a significant upgrade in design, sound quality, and the capacity to pick up voice instructions from across the room. Today, you will find many smart speakers for Rs. 10,000.\n\nThe Google Nest Audio is available in Chalk (white) and Charcoal (black). It stands upright on a tabletop and looks lovely with its fabric-wrapped body. There is only one physical switch at the back to mute the microphone, and the top of the speaker features a touch-sensitive area for controlling playback, volume, and essential functions. This results in an efficient design that encourages you to use your voice to control the speaker, and voice commands work well on Google Nest Audio.\n\nApple is less dominant in the smart speaker market than Google and Amazon, but the HomePod line recently received a major update. The Apple HomePod mini, priced at Rs. 9,999,, is smaller and less expensive than the original HomePod, making it far more accessible and straightforward. It's also great for highly committed consumers to the Apple ecosystem, as using the smart speaker requires an iOS device and an Apple Music membership.\n\nThe smart speaker employs Apple's Siri voice assistant, which, like other comparable helpers, can be activated hands-free using the 'Hey Siri' command. You'll need a paid Apple Music subscription to play specific tunes, as the smart speaker does not support alternative streaming services like Spotify or YouTube Music. Apple has announced that its Lossless Audio tier will be supported on the HomePod mini via a future firmware update. You may even utilise two HomePod small speakers as a stereo system. The sound quality is superb given its size and form aspect, and the HomePod small integrates well with the Apple ecosystem, making it a smart choice if you already have Apple products at home.\n\nSmart speakers have various sizes and shapes, but most options priced below Rs. 2,779 are small. The Mi Smart Speaker provides a robust and powerful sound that rivals the Google Nest Audio while competitively priced at Rs. 3,999. It's a fully functional smart speaker with Google Assistant and a rated sound output of 12W.\n\nWhile the sound occasionally needed more finesse, the style could be much better than Google and Amazon's more visually appealing fabric-wrapped options. The Mi Smart Speaker is a good value for money with powerful, pleasurable sound and handy smart features. If you are on a tight budget, this option is for Top Smart Speakers with Must-Have Features in India.\n\nMost smart speakers do not have built-in batteries and must be connected to a wall outlet to operate. However, a few solutions can act as wireless smart speakers. The Sony SRS-XB402M, priced at Rs. 19,990, is among these possibilities among our Top Smart Speakers with Must-Have Features in India.\n\nThis is an outstanding smart speaker for various reasons, including direct access to Amazon's Alexa voice assistant via Wi-Fi connectivity, Spotify's Connect function for streaming over Wi-Fi, IP67 dust and water protection, and good sound quality. The Sony SRS-XB402M's built-in battery eliminates the need to keep it plugged in at all times, making it an excellent choice for outdoor use.",

        "text": "Mumbai: Wolf Bread is a multimedia company bringing global pop culture experiences to India. The brand was started with a vision to revolutionize multimedia and entertainment by introducing fresh, innovative concepts that redefine pop culture in India. Wolf Bread's commitment to excellence and innovation reflect in its efforts to pioneer new creative horizons in music videos, filmmaking, fashion, animation, designer clothing, sports, and other visual experiences, making it the brand's unique selling proposition.\n\nIncepted in 2023 by Taufiq Khan, Wolf Bread aspires to become a leading figure in displaying unique and finest forms of visual storytelling, commercialization, animation, and the popularization of art, aiming to revolutionize the creative landscape in India for the very first time. The brand aims not just to entertain but also to inspire, spark conversations, and leave a lasting impression on the cultural landscape.\n\nFrom their debut music video to their expanding portfolio of projects, Wolf Bread continuously pushes boundaries, harnessing the power of cutting-edge VFX, CGI, and 3D animation to craft immersive experiences. Headquartered in Mumbai, Wolf Bread's identity extends beyond traditional boundaries. The brand's upcoming ventures include the launch of an exclusive designer clothing line and unique merchandise, reflecting their dedication to style and pop culture.\n\nIndiantelevision.com reached out to Wolf bread founder Taufiq Khan, where he shared insights on lot of aspects from being awarded as the 'Best Startup Company\" to their strategies, dveling upon the creative landscape and more...\n\nEdited excerpts\n\nOn being awarded the \"Best Startup Company\" at the Pune Startup Fest in 2024 and planning to build upon this recognition and momentum moving forward\n\nI'm grateful for this award! We just snagged the \"Best Startup Company\" award at the Pune Startup Fest, and we've been around for only four months! We were invited to showcase our work and our work did not just impress the crowd- it won them over. It might sound like a stretch, we're not called the best for nothing! Our success isn't just some fluke. Just like our brand name, our team functions like a wolf pack -- ruthless, agile, and ready to take on any challenge. From the work culture to our workflow and vision, every part of our company is top-notch. We don't just build a company; we build each other up. This accolade, It's like a cosmic thumbs-up, confirming that we're on the right path. We know we're still in the early days, and there are a lot of chapters to unfold, but we're ready for whatever comes our way. We're aiming for the big leagues like Apple -- starting small but thinking big. The momentum we're building for the future is all about growth and self-improvement. We'll take this award as a milestone and keep working hard to bring entertainment and a unique style that has never been seen before in India. We're just getting started, and there's a lot more winning to do!\n\nOn aiming to revolutionize the creative landscape in India through its unique forms of visual storytelling, animation, and the popularization of art\n\nWolf Bread was created to break the mold. I'm diving into what I love, which is already a revolution in itself. Sometimes I catch myself thinking I'm the GOAT in visual storytelling, animation, and making art pop. I'm not just doing this for fun; I thrive on pop culture. What I create inspires me, and that passion flows through everything I do. Luck or not, I've found my calling and I'm all in. My instincts guide me to shape storytelling, creativity, and animation.\n\nThe secret of Wolf Bread? Authenticity and originality. We're bringing something fresh to India. Our uniqueness stands out, especially now with Wolf Bread Animation Studios and Wolf Bread Clothing -- something India hasn't seen before. We've got plenty more avenues to explore in the years ahead.\n\nIn terms of popularizing art, I believe I'm unmatched. We're aiming for popularity on a whole new level, and we've created a mascot, \"Mr. Wolf Bread,\" who might one day stand alongside Disney and Pixar legends. Our focus is pop culture. No one else in India is even close. I'm blessed to be the first on this path, cooking up something amazing. I'll serve the best India has ever seen, and people will savor it for years. We're creating something exceptional. We're not trying to be like anyone else - we're making our mark, and we're here to stay!\n\nOn reception of Wolf Bread's music videos on YouTube and creatives on social media platforms and the strategies does company employ to engage with its audience effectively\n\nThe response to our debut music video has been mind-blowing. We're already past the million views mark, setting a new standard in the music video world. It's not just a music video; it's like planting a flag as the pioneers of something fresh in India. We made sure to put ourselves on the world map by being the first independent brand in India to introduce a unique style and aesthetic to the world with this music video.\n\nThe reception has been wild. We're moving like seasoned pros, even though we're just starting out.\n\nUsually, success takes a couple of tries, but here we are nailing it on the first go. It's unheard of for an independent brand or artist to make such a splash right off the bat. Who else would even dare to take\n\nsuch risks?\n\nWe're fearless, bold, and extraordinary. My mindset is transforming this company into a powerhouse. Our approach to creatives and animation has taken our social media game to another level. We don't just create daily posts; each one is like a movie poster or trailer. Our social media is a filmmaking platform to bring our vision and creativity to life.\n\nThe response, Pure madness. We're not relying on controversial statements to grab attention like some podcasts do. We're like Mr. Bean right now -- people see our creativity and just can't help but smile. Wolf Bread is more than a brand; it's a feeling, a mood and an unstoppable force.\n\nOn providing insights into Wolf Bread's approach to commercialization and monetization of its multimedia content\n\nCommercializing and monetizing is a skill we're mastering quietly, without broadcasting it. Wolf Bread Animation Studios is on the rise because we excel in branding and animation movies, working closely with other brands and movie studios. Our main aim in creating content isn't just to rake in the cash; the content we make happens to generate income because we're naturally talented at it. We're monetizing what we're good at and reaping the rewards. We'll get into the details later, but for now, just know that animation studios are about more than making money. We're injecting style and aesthetics into the brand and any studios that collaborate with us.\n\nWe're aiming to be the next Pixar, Disney, or Sony Animations in a 5-10 year plan. And get ready, because we're launching our own designer clothing brand to speak volumes about what makes us money. We're monetizing the branding game. Monetizing Wolf Bread might seem tricky since we're working in the future, bringing a fresh style of art to India. It may take others a bit of time to catch up, but we've got itcovered, jumping right into monetization. Sure, if we look back, we see other brands took a while to be understood and then started making money. But not us! We're running the show from the future, and being the forward-thinking company we are, we're playing the long game and making strides.\n\nOn leveraging technology and innovation to stay ahead of the curve in the rapidly evolving multimedia industry\n\nWe're a pop culture brand for a reason -- we evolve daily and stay ahead of technology and innovation. That's why Wolf Bread Animation Studios is coming into the picture. Leveraging opportunities is our jam; it's how we grow and learn. This keeps us ahead of the curve, setting trends that no other brands, studios, or artists in India are even riding. We're the trailblazers in what we're creating, leading the charge in this new wave. What we're doing at Wolf Bread Animation Studios is what Disney and Pixar are up to, but they do it on a grander scale. We may be a small company, but we've got a big vision that speaks for itself. Innovation, strategy, and keeping up with the tech world are our playground. We see every advancement as a chance to blend with our ideas and creativity. We're here to lead the pack!\n\nOn share some of the core values and principles that drive Wolf Bread's mission to bring unique experiences to audiences across India and beyond\n\nThe core of our company is right in the name: \"WOLF BREAD.\" This name captures the essence of our ethos -- just like a wolf, we're disciplined, focused, and loyal. We're all about originality, hard work and moving like a wolf pack. Our company thrives on this magnetic energy -- it's diverse and all over the place, yet perfectly aligned. We've stumbled more than a few times, but that's how we learn and grow. We never give up; we rise from our mistakes stronger and wiser. Our clothing line will embody the spirit of sports crests, akin to wearing the jersey of beloved teams such as the Indian cricket team or Chelsea Football Club - two of my personal favorites. It's about wearing our apparel with passion and pride, standing tall and believing in something greater that leads to triumph and victory. Just as fans proudly wear the jersey of their favorite sports teams, I will make sure people wear WOLF BREAD apparel with that same pride and belief.",

        "text": "Cavan County Council €4M bill to fix multi-storey carpark in county town Cavan County Council Seamus Enright Published: Fri 26 Apr 2024, 7:52 AM\n\nSome €4 million will be spent on essential repair works to the Multistorey Carpark in Cavan Town, more than double what was previously reported.\n\nThe bill was previously estimated at between €1-1.5 million. The facility is set to close fully from May 20, with the \"significant refurbishment contract\" expected to begin shortly thereafter.\n\nThe repair project, under the public works contract for minor building and civil engineering works, is expected to take until early next year to complete.\n\nIn April 2020, Cavan County Council commissioned Malachy Walsh & Partners Ltd to deliver a number of reports on the condition and proposed future development of the multistorey parking facility, which has had \"no major interventions\" since it was first constructed back in 2001.\n\nOne report, completed in 2021, \"advised the precautionary closure\" of carpark levels 7 to 15, and also made a number of recommendations regarding important maintenance to ensure the \"long term viability\" of the town centre property. It's understood the upgrades will focus on structural improvements, rather than any form of reconfiguration within.\n\nCavan County Council appointed Alan Traynor Consulting Engineers in 2023 to oversee the design, procurement of contractors and supervision of the works.\n\nA tender competition was completed last September with a contractor expected to be announced shortly.\n\nPreviously the council thought that interim measures could be taken to reopen levels 7-15, however it was ultimately considered more \"prudent and less disruptive\" to keep them closed while design, construction, and modernisation works were undertaken.\n\nAs spokesperson for the council confirmed to the Celt that \"major structural elements\" of the planned building works include the \"replacement of weakened structural steel members in the internal ramps\", followed by sand blasting the entire structural steel frame back to bare steel, before \"applying three coats of fireproofing intumescent paint to meet current fire safety standards\".\n\nThe installation of a \"new traffic management system\" including entrance and exit barriers, as well as the installation of modern pay stations capable of taking card, cash and Android, Google and Apple Pay methods of payment. The two existing passenger lifts are also set to be replaced, together with an \"upgrade to all other electrical and mechanical services\".\n\n\"New wall finishes, CCTV on all levels including lift lobbies with emergency communication buttons, together with a new lighting system are all aimed at making the carpark a safe, accessible, and convenient place to park in Cavan Town Centre. The project has a nine-month contract period.\" The carpark has had a storied history, ever since it was built more than 20 years ago by Elliott's. The local authority purchased the facility in 2014 as per the conditions of a watertight, pre-agreement with its previous owners, the nine person-strong Virginia Consortium.\n\nTrading as Glassell Ltd, of which council is the sole shareholder, the loss-making facility was purchased with a €4m 30-year loan. The council pays annual charges in the region of €166,000 per annum on the loan, signed in 2015.\n\nUp to that point the off-street parking property had sustained losses of over €5m in rent, at €500,000 per year, plus running costs.\n\nIn recent years, the carpark has been affected by rises in maintenance and energy costs.\n\nThe pandemic also had a major impact on usage rates, with income slashed by 72.5% in 2020 compared to the previous year.\n\nThe multi-storey requires yearly capital contributions from the council in order to operate. In 2023, the authority adopted in its budget a contribution to Glassell Ltd of €100,000.\n\nIt's hoped the revamp, once complete, will boost occupancy rates.\n\nCavan County Council Seamus Enright Published: Fri 26 Apr 2024, 7:52 AM",

        "text": "BEMOWO PISKIE TRAINING GROUND, POLAND - Saber Strike 24, a multilateral NATO exercise spanning nearly one month, demonstrated the capability and interoperability of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment (2CR), V Corps, and NATO Allied forces through increasingly complex training events. The exercise ends as participants and equipment begin the long journey home with more experience, knowledge, and more than a few international patches traded between them.\n\nThis iteration of Saber Strike kicked off with a tactical road march from Rose Barracks, Germany, to Bemowo Piskie Training Ground (BPTA), Poland. Preparations on 2CR's end have been underway since last June. Upon arrival at BPTA, 2CR conducted a hand-over-take-over (HOTO) between U.S. Army Col. Robert McChrystal, the commander of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment, and Czech Army Brig. Gen. Jan Stepanek, the deputy commander of NATO Multinational Division North-East. Once the HOTO was complete, numerous Allied and partner nations participated in live-fire exercises involving infantry, armor, aerial assets, and artillery.\n\nA key aspect of Saber Strike 24 involved defining the distributed Command and Control (C2) between NATO Allies and partner nations. As the scenario in the exercise developed, each partner nation faced challenges across various domains. The exercise proved to be an essential test of interoperability during multilateral operations. The coordination of these nations supporting one another in a single engagement was one of the specific goals of the exercise. Technological innovations like the Radio Integration Communications Suite (RICS), part of the Mission Partner Kit (MPK), were created to assist with interoperability.\n\n\"Technical interoperability enhances readiness and allows us to stay ahead on the battlefield,\" said U.S. Army 1st Lt. Joshua Chang, a liaison officer with 2CR.\n\nThree applications make up the MPK: the end-to-end encryption service Wickr, the voice interoperability application Instant Connect Enterprise (ICE), and a Tactical Assault Kit (TAK) with variations for operating systems from Apple, Android, and Windows devices. The RICS kit is also included in the MPK.\n\n\"We already used the systems on our march here together with 2CR,\" said German Army Lt. Col. Sebastian Hagen, the commander of the 1st Jäger Battalion, 21st Panzer Brigade. \"From my point of view, it works pretty well. It is easy to handle, even for German company commanders who have never seen this system before. It took them just hours to operate the systems.\"\n\nNATO Allies participating in the exercise worked closely together to exercise and hone skills and interoperability. Each Allied and partner nation focused on the overall goal of collective security and functionality, an imperative task for the countries alongside NATO's eastern flank.\n\n\"Saber Strike is an important exercise to improve the tactics, techniques, and procedures of all Allied nations,\" said Italian Army Graduato Scelto Gianluca Ruggiero. The Italian Army was integrated during a multinational live-fire during Saber Strike 24. The live-fire had Spanish, Italian, and German forces all supporting U.S. tanks.\n\nSaber Strike is integral to the Dynamic Employment of Forces to Europe for NATO Deterrence and Enhanced Readiness (DEFENDER) series of training exercises. DEFENDER 24 is the largest U.S. Army exercise in Europe and includes more than 17,000 U.S. and 23,000 multinational service members from more than 20 Allied and partner nations.\n\n\"We accomplished several things here during the exercise,\" McChrystal said. \"It really serves as a training highlight for our year. I just want to highlight one thing: the value of this training for our Soldiers and being part of Steadfast Defender, the largest exercise in Europe.\"\n\nSaber Strike is an imperative example of the dynamic training required for deterrence in the European region. These exercises exemplify NATO's importance and the resounding commitment to collective security and cohesiveness among allied and partner nations.\n\n\"I'm pretty impressed how my task force has integrated with the 2nd Cavalry Regiment,\" said Hagen. \"I have the feeling that the commander is treating me like every other officer or lieutenant commander, and that's a good feeling. I am impressed at how easily my company commanders integrated into the system, and how they can work together with allies and partners.\"\n\nThe exercise culminated with a regrouping of forces as NATO Allies worked with 2CR to establish defensive positions in the Suwalki Gap. Members of 2CR's 4th Squadron integrated and trained with Poland's Territorial Defense Forces, sharing tactics, skills, and experiences in the biting cold of the training area.\n\n\"I think it's powerful that our Soldiers are integrating with their partners,\" said U.S. Army Command Sgt. Maj. Dennis Doyle, command sergeant major for 2CR. \"We're all eating together, all sharing the same space together, and that right there sends a powerful message that we're all partners and friends.\"",

Without corrosion control, lead leeched from the pipes.\n\nAlmost a decade ago, pediatrician Mona Hanna-Attisha took to a podium in Flint, Mich. and demanded that the world pay attention to an unfolding water crisis.\n\nThe city of Flint was near bankruptcy and controlled by emergency financial managers. To save money, officials decided to switch the municipal water source from Lake Huron to the Flint River on April 25th, 2014. Flint is a majority-Black city, and at the time, an estimated 40% of residents lived in poverty. Many immediately noticed a difference in their water quality.\n\n\"We had greenish and brownish water. It smelled weird. It was giving people's rashes and they were losing hair. Patients were asking, 'Was it okay to use this tap water to mix their babies' formula?\" Dr. Hanna-Attisha recalls.\n\nState and city officials reassured Flint residents that the water was safe. That wasn't true.\n\nElin Betanzo, a former employee of the Environmental Protection Agency had also seen a lead crisis unfold in Washington D.C. in 2004. Betanzo implored Hanna-Attisha, a friend from high school, to look into the issue.\n\n\"She literally stared me down like, 'Mona, the water doesn't have corrosion control.' That is the moment that I heard about the possibility of lead being in the water. And that's the moment my life changed,\" Hanna-Attisha remembers.\n\nCorrosion control changes the chemistry of the water to make it less likely for any material in the pipes to leach into the water. Without that corrosion control, the lead in Flint's pipes got into the water supply of tens of thousands of residents.\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention says no amount of lead in children is safe. Lead poisoning in young children can damage their brains and nervous systems, cause learning and behavioral problems, and harm hearing and speech. In adults, lead exposure is associated with kidney damage, high blood pressure and cardiovascular problems.\n\nAfter the water source change, Dr. Hanna-Attisha saw a crisis in the making and began looking for data to prove it. On September 24, 2015, a year-and-a-half after that water switch, she went public with her results. They showed that the percentage of children in Flint with elevated levels of lead in their blood had gone up.\n\nAt first, the state dismissed her findings. But Hanna-Attisha was right.\n\nToday, Hanna-Attisha is the founding director of the Pediatric Public Health Initiative, which connects Flint families to programs aimed to alleviate poverty, support education and improve health outcomes. Rx Kids is a cash-transfer program gives new moms in Flint a no-strings-attached check of $7500.\n\n\"In a city that so many folks know as a city that failed kids, Flint is a city that's learning, that's leading with science. That's leading with prevention to promote the healthy development of kids by boldly eradicating infant poverty,\" she says.\n\nIn the last decade, the city's water quality has improved. Thousands of lead pipes in Flint have been replaced, but not all. That means that not every resident in Flint has clean, fresh water.\n\nIt's a problem goes well beyond Flint.\n\nCities and towns all over the United States are facing their own issues with water quality, aging infrastructure and inadequate lead safety protections.\n\nA 2023 report from the EPA revealed that in 2021, lead made up 9% of the nation's service line infrastructure, representing an estimated 9.2 million pipes. Half of those pipes are concentrated in six states: Florida, Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and New York.\n\nIn Chicago alone, 400,000 homes still get their tap water through lead service lines. A recent study published in JAMA Pediatrics found that nearly 70% of young children in the city are exposed to lead through their home tap water. The study also found that Black and Hispanic neighborhoods are more likely to have lead exposure, but less likely to be tested for lead.\n\nThe Lead and Copper Rule -- first issued by the EPA in 1991 -- requires local water systems with over 15 parts per billion of lead in the water to initiate corrosion control. But about 90% of cases where local water systems exceeded these limits never got reported to the federal government, according to EPA audits.\n\n\"This was probably the worst reported and enforced regulation in the history of the drinking water program,\" says Elizabeth Southerland, former director of the Office of Science and Technology in the Office of Water at EPA and a current member of the Environmental Protection Network.\n\nIn November 2023, the EPA proposed Lead and Copper Rule Improvements, among them:\n\nChicago, however, would get an exemption to the 10-year timeline, as it would take an estimated 40 years to replace the 400,000 pipes.\n\n\"That's decades. That's generations of children and adults consuming lead contaminated water. It's incomprehensible to tell a resident that they need to wait that long for safe drinking water,\" said Chakena Perry with the Natural Resources Defense Council.\n\nPerry and others are pushing for the EPA to close up those exemptions when the rule changes are finalized this fall.\n\nHave questions or comments for us to consider for a future episode?

China's legitimate development rights have been unreasonably suppressed and our core interests are facing challenges,\" he said.\n\nBlinken replied that \"active diplomacy\" was needed to move forward with the agenda set by President Joe Biden and President Xi Jinping when they met in San Francisco in November.\n\n\"There's no substitute in our judgement for face-to-face diplomacy,\" Blinken said, adding that he wanted to ensure that \"we're as clear as possible about the areas where we have differences, at the very least to avoid misunderstandings, to avoid miscalculations\".\n\nBlinken and Wang met in a guesthouse which is part of a sprawling complex of villas, lakes and gardens where many foreign dignitaries, including the then-U.S. President Richard Nixon, have been received.\n\nU.S. State Department officials signalled ahead of the sessions that China's support for Russia would feature strongly, saying that Washington is prepared to act against Chinese companies that have been helping retool and resupply Russia's defence industry.\n\nThey have said that such assistance risks hurting the broader China-U.S. relationship, even as ties stabilise after being hit by then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan in 2022 and the U.S. downing of a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon in February 2023.\n\nDespite increasing high-level exchanges and working groups tackling issues such as enhanced military communication and global trade, stark differences remain.\n\nHours before Blinken landed in China on Wednesday, Biden signed a biapartisan bill that included $8 billion to counter China's military might, as well as billions in defence aid for Taiwan and $61 billion for Ukraine.\n\nThe disputed South China Sea also remains a flashpoint, while the U.S. is eager to see more progress on the curbing of China's supply of the chemicals to used to make fentanyl.\n\nTodd Robinson, Assistant Secretary of State for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, and Nathaniel Fick, ambassador-at-large for cyberspace, are among the officials and envoys accompanying Blinken.\n\nWang laid out China's position, saying the U.S. must not step on \"red lines\" covering sovereignty, security and development interests - an apparent reference to Taiwan, the democratically-governed island that China claims as its own, and the disputed South China Sea.\n\nBlinken is likely to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping today before he returns to Washington in the evening, although neither side has yet confirmed a meeting.\n\nHe is also meeting China's minister of public security, Wang Xiaohong.\n\nAhead of the talks, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen also signalled that the Biden administration was not taking any options off the table to respond to China's excess industrial capacity.\n\nYellen told Reuters Next in an interview in Washington that China exporting its way to full employment is not acceptable to the rest of the world.\n\nWhite House says US passed written warning of Moscow attack to Russia Earthquake halts some flights at New York area airports Apple's annual conference to take place in June",

        "text": "WhatsApp is rolling out a new feature that promises to streamline the login process while enhancing security. Building on its existing support for biometric authentication, WhatsApp is introducing passkeys -- automatic passwords that enable users to access their accounts swiftly without relying on SMS verification codes or traditional passwords.\n\nThis update mirrors a similar feature previously available to Android users, further aligning the use experience across platforms.\n\nLeveraging FaceID, TouchID\n\nThe introduction of passkeys was officially announced by WhatsApp on April 24, 2024. The feature, which leverages Face ID, Touch ID, or passcodes, aims to offer a more secure and convenient login method.\n\nPasskeys eliminate the need for SMS verification, making it easier to access your account even in situations where network connectivity is limited or absent.\n\nAlice Newton-Rex, WhatsApp's head of product, emphasized the benefits of passkey authentication. According to her statement, \"Passkey verification will make logging back into WhatsApp easier and more secure. We're excited to launch this in WhatsApp and give users an added layer of security.\"\n\nWebAuthn\n\nPasskeys operate on the WebAuthn (Web Authentication) framework, generating two distinct keys during setup -- a public key stored by the service provider and a private key stored securely on the user's device. This setup ensures robust security while simplifying the logging process for users.\n\nThe introduction of passkeys underscores a broader trend toward passwordless authentication in the tech industry. By harnessing biometric capabilities and device-based authentication, services like WhatsApp are not only enhancing security but also improving user experience by eliminating the hassle of remembering and entering passwords.\n\nTo enable passkeys on iOS, users can navigate to Settings > Account > Passkeys. While the rollout is underway, some users may not immediately see this option but should expect it in the coming weeks as the update reaches all devices.\n\nIn addition to bolstering security, this update aligns WhatsApp with other major platforms that already support passkey authentication, including Apple's and Google's password vaults, as well as popular password managers like 1Password and Dashlane.\n\nReplacing Traditional Passwords\n\nThe shift towards passkeys represents a significant step towards a future where traditional passwords are replaced by more convenient and secure methods of authentication.\n\nLooking ahead, WhatsApp's commitment to innovation is evident as it continues to refine and expand its features across various devices. This development not only improves accessibility for iPhone users but also sets the stage for a more streamlined and secure user experience within the messaging app.\n\nAs WhatsApp continues to evolve, users can expect further enhancements that prioritize both security and user convenience, ultimately redefining the standards of authentication within the digital landscape.\n\nPasskeys are emerging as a promising future for login authentication due to several key advantages and technological advancements that address the limitations of traditional password-based systems.\n\nEnhanced security is one of the reasons passkeys are considered the future of logging. They utilize device-based authentication methods which are inherently more secure than traditional passwords. Biometric authentication offers a high level of security because it relies on unique physical characteristics that are difficult to replicate.",

        "text": "The description for the \"Building for the future of Wear OS\" session includes a few early details about what the upgrade will bring.\n\nGoogle I/O 2024 is quickly coming to the forefront, as the event will start in a few weeks and may bring new hardware and software announcements from Google. The company gave us our first real idea of what to expect when it released a preliminary I/O 2024 schedule on Thursday, April 25. That schedule includes an early confirmation that a Wear OS upgrade is coming soon.\n\nThere are four main categories for events at Google I/O this year: mobile, web, ML/AI, and cloud. One of the mobile sessions is titled \"Building for the future of Wear OS,\" and it explicitly lists Wear OS 5 -- the unreleased version of Wear OS previously expected to come this year -- as its focus. Back in January, references to Wear OS 5 were spotted in an Android 14 build, hinting that an upgrade was on the horizon.\n\nStill, there was no official confirmation from Google that Wear OS 5 would be released in the near future. While we expect to hear about upcoming Android updates at Google I/O, Wear OS upgrades are typically released on a staggered and inconsistent schedule. That's why Google's announcement has more significance than a typical Google I/O software announcement and bodes well for the future of Google's wearable ecosystem.\n\nSurprisingly, Google gave a little bit away about Wear OS 5 in the description for its preview session. \"In this talk, we'll discover the new features of Wear OS 5,\" Google says. \"This includes advances in the Watch Face Format, and how to design and build for the increasing range of device sizes.\"\n\nThe Watch Face Format was introduced about a year ago alongside Wear OS 4, and Google explains that it \"can be used to build watch faces directly, or it can be integrated into creation tools, allowing designers to create watch faces without having to write any executable code.\" It shifted much of the burden of creating a custom watch face -- such as optimization, updates, and bug fixes -- off of individual developers and onto the Wear OS platform. Additionally, it added a consistent UI for editing watch faces across first and third-party options.\n\nThis gives watch face designers a lot of ways to customize their offerings, and pairs nicely with the Watch Face Studio from Samsung, which can be used to create XML-formatted watch faces in the Watch Face Format.\n\nSo, Google's talk about updating the Watch Face Format in Wear OS 5 could bring new features and options to your favorite watch faces. There might be new ways to show complications, adapt a watch face's appearance situationally, or add new design tools. This is all just speculation, but Google clearly has new tricks available in the updated Watch Face Format that will be showcased at I/O 2024.\n\nThe one thing we do know for sure is that the Watch Face Format, or watch face design software, will be updated to help developers build for different smartwatch sizes. Google says as much in the description for the Wear OS 5 showcase, and it isn't exactly surprising. Rumors are swirling that Google will finally add a new, larger Pixel Watch size later this year in the Pixel Watch 3 series. It only makes sense that it wants to make sure Wear OS watch faces will look great on all Pixel Watch models.\n\nForget specific features -- it's a massive achievement that we're getting a Wear OS 5 upgrade this year at all. Wear OS devices are firmly hitting their stride, with Samsung releasing excellent Galaxy Watch models and Google joining in with the Pixel Watch over a year ago. In that context, it's easy to forget how feeble the entire Wear OS platform was just a few years ago.\n\nLooking back at Google's Wear OS forums, you can find countless examples of early Wear OS users describing the uncertain future of the platform and issues that had gone unresolved for months or years. One post from 2020 asked, \"Is Google abandoning Wear OS?\" and received support from other Wear OS users before it was locked and replies were disabled. The issue cited in the post? Google had developed a YouTube Music app for watchOS, but not Wear OS. It's a perfect microcosm of the problems that plagued the dark days of Wear OS.\n\nNow, it's rebounding, and Wear OS 5's release this year may be the start of a consistent annual release schedule for Google for major version updates. That would put it on par with Apple's watchOS release schedule and would be great news for Wear OS users. The hardware available in Wear OS watches is quite good in 2024, thanks to chips like the Snapdragon W5 Plus Gen 1, but the software still lags behind Apple Watch models in many ways. Now, with Google seemingly going all-in on Wear OS with its partner Samsung, that may be changing for good.",

        "text": "As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly integrated into our daily lives, the choice of an AI assistant is more critical than ever. This comparative analysis takes an in-depth look at three leading AI assistants -- Rabbit R1, Humane AI Pin, and Siri -- evaluating their performance, functionality, user experience, and other key factors to help you make an informed decision.\n\nRigorous testing reveals that among the three AI assistants, Siri consistently outperforms in processing speed and accuracy. Siri responds to user requests and queries more swiftly than both Rabbit R1 and Humane AI Pin, with a higher degree of precision.\n\nSome performance challenges noted with Rabbit R1 and Humane AI Pin include:\n\nThese performance issues can significantly impact the overall user experience and the practical utility of the AI assistant in day-to-day scenarios.\n\nA key aspect of any AI assistant is its ability to provide accurate, relevant information in response to user queries. In tests involving a wide range of general knowledge questions, Siri demonstrates superior accuracy compared to Rabbit R1 and Humane AI Pin. While the latter two assistants can handle similar query types, they do so with less consistency and often at a slower pace than Siri.\n\nThis reliability in providing correct, timely information is crucial for users who depend on their AI assistant for quick factual lookups, making Siri a more dependable choice in this regard.\n\nFor users who frequently communicate across different languages, an AI assistant's translation features are invaluable. Both Siri and Humane AI Pin offer robust translation capabilities, allowing users to easily convert text or speech between a wide range of languages.\n\nHowever, Siri slightly edges out Humane AI Pin in this domain due to its tighter integration with other device functionalities. For example, Siri can more seamlessly translate incoming messages or web pages, enhancing the overall user experience.\n\nBeyond technical capabilities, the physical design of an AI assistant plays a significant role in its usability and appeal. The Humane AI Pin stands out with its sleek, minimalist aesthetic, making it an attractive choice from a purely visual standpoint.\n\nHowever, practical considerations like battery life and heat management are where the Humane AI Pin falls short compared to Siri and Rabbit R1. Users who rely heavily on their AI assistant throughout the day may find the Humane AI Pin's shorter battery life and tendency to overheat limiting.\n\nSeamless integration with a user's existing device ecosystem is a key factor in delivering a superior AI assistant user experience. This is where Siri shines, particularly for users already invested in the Apple ecosystem.\n\nSiri's tight integration across iPhones, iPads, Macs, and other Apple devices allows for a more unified, efficient experience. Users can easily sync preferences, settings, and data across their devices, making Siri feel like a cohesive part of their digital life.\n\nBased on this comparative analysis, Siri emerges as the most advanced and reliable AI assistant among the three evaluated. Its superior performance, accuracy, translation capabilities, and seamless integration with the Apple ecosystem make it the top choice for users seeking a robust, efficient AI companion.\n\nWhile Rabbit R1 and Humane AI Pin each bring some innovative features to the table, they currently lag behind Siri in critical areas like overall performance, functionality, and ecosystem integration. As AI technology continues to evolve at a rapid pace, these assistants will need to make significant strides to catch up to Siri's current capabilities.\n\nFor now, Siri remains the most compelling choice for anyone in need of a powerful, dependable AI assistant that can keep pace with the demands of modern digital life.",

A majority of this cobalt is mined in Congo and leads to human rights abuses including child labor, she alleged.\n\nHogan thinks that climate change cannot be resolved by tech solutions such as EVs. She instead recommends that cities be made less car-friendly.\n\nWhy It Matters: Musk has denied the heavy use of cobalt at Tesla going as far back as 2021. \"On a weighted-average basis we might use 2% cobalt compared to say, Apple's 100% cobalt,\" Musk then said.\n\nIn a shareholder meeting last May, Musk said that he would personally review the third-party audit of its cobalt supply chain despite shareholders rejecting the proposal for a third-party audit.\n\n\"We will do a third-party audit. In fact, we'll put a webcam on the mine and if anybody sees any children please let us know,\" Musk said.\n\n\"I recommend complaining to the phone manufacturers,\" the CEO added. \"But even for the small amount of cobalt that we do use, we will make sure that no child labor is being exploited.\"\n\nCheck out more of Benzinga's Future Of Mobility coverage by following this link.\n\nRead More: GM Unveils Plans For Autonomous Driving Unit Cruise Relaunch After Hiatus, Expects $1.7B In Expenses\n\nLoading...Loading...Market News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs",

While we're not sure if Samsung will unveil the Watch 7 Pro in the next generation Watch 7 series, one thing we can say for sure is that Samsung will indeed introduce a brand-new smartwatch called the Galaxy Watch Ultra.\n\nPreviously, details regarding the battery size of the Galaxy Watch 7 Pro had surfaced. According to the latest findings in our database, Samsung might introduce the Watch Ultra instead of the Watch 7 Pro. We expect Samsung to unveil three new watches: the Watch 7, Watch 7 Classic, and Watch Ultra.\n\nEarlier reports indicated a larger battery (578mAh) for an upcoming Galaxy Watch with the model number of EB-BL705ABY. While we expected three new watches (Watch 7, Watch 7 Classic, and Watch Ultra), Samsung might skip the Classic model as Samsung had previously skipped the Classic model with the Watch5 series. Our database reveals three distinct model numbers (SM-L705U, SM-L705N, and SM-L705F) for the upcoming Galaxy Watch Ultra. These model numbers represent the US, Korea, and Global. The new Watch Ultra will be officially launched in several regions.\n\nWe know that the Galaxy Watch FE will carry similar features to the Galaxy Watch4 introduced in 2021. The Galaxy Watch4 still holds up quite well even in 2024. It's great to see Samsung introducing an affordable Watch model because not everyone's budget is sufficient for a smartwatch. Considering that many premium smartwatches cost almost the same as a mid-range Android smartphone, it makes sense for companies to introduce an affordable alternative smartwatch.\n\nSamsung is also expected to launch the Samsung Galaxy Watch FE in the coming months. This naming strategy mirrors Apple's recent approach with the Apple Watch Ultra and Apple Watch SE. Samsung's Watch FE will serve as a more budget-friendly alternative to the Watch Ultra. As previously mentioned in our Galaxy Watch FE article, the Galaxy Watch FE will be available with specific models (SM-R866F, SM-R866U, and SM-R866N) for the US, Korea, and other markets. The watch is expected to share features with the well-regarded Galaxy Watch4 (2021).\n\nPhones and smartwatches have undoubtedly made everyone's lives easier. Especially if you're someone who frequently works out, tracking your fitness activity can be highly beneficial. Despite their relatively limited functions, smartwatches still come with high price tags. However, Samsung's decision to introduce the Watch FE as an alternative to the Watch Ultra is a commendable step.\n\nWe can expect significant differences between the Watch Ultra and Watch FE, although we don't currently have exact technical specifications for both watches. Samsung may surprise us this year by introducing a highly advanced smartwatch. The Watch Ultra could feature advanced sensors that allow for more accurate tracking of workout activities, such as providing more accurate data while swimming due to increased durability against water pressure. Additionally, it could provide more accurate GPS tracking. It's safe to say that the battery life of the Watch Ultra will be significantly better, as Samsung plans to use a much larger battery than ever before in its next smartwatch.",

It offers users a safer and convenient way to log in to their accounts.\n\nWhatsApp is rolling out a new security feature for iOS users: passkey support.\n\nThis feature, first announced in beta testing earlier this year, allows users to log in to their WhatsApp accounts using Face ID, Touch ID, or a passcode, replacing traditional password-based authentication.\n\nPasskeys utilise public key cryptography, a more secure alternative to traditional login methods.\n\nThis technology generates two sets of keys: one stored on the platform's cloud and the other kept locally on the user's device, likely within Apple's Keychain system for iOS users.\n\nAuthentication occurs only when both keys match, making it significantly more resistant to phishing attacks and other online threats.\n\nTo activate passkey on your iPhone:\n\nOnce these steps are completed, your passkey will be set up, adding an extra layer of security to your WhatsApp account on your iOS device.\n\nWhile WhatsApp has confirmed the availability of passkeys for iOS users, the specific iOS versions supporting this feature remain unclear. A previous report suggests compatibility with iOS 17 and later.\n\nIt's worth noting that Android users have already had access to a similar passwordless login feature for some time.",

Writing to Cook, the lawyers said \"it has become clear to us that year after year, Apple has sold technology made with minerals sourced from a region whose population is being devastated by grave violations of human rights.\"\n\n\"The iPhones, Mac computers and accessories that Apple sells to its customers around the world rely on supply chains that are too opaque, and that are tainted by the blood of the Congolese people,\" the lawyers said. Eastern Congo is one of the most mineral-rich regions in the world but is also the site of a huge humanitarian disaster, with the armed groups fighting for years for control of the mines and the valuable minerals in them, and millions of people displaced and affected by the worsening...",
